<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/macro-market-mega-theme-callum-thomas/">Calum Thomas combines his top charts ideas into one</a>. His ideas are:
    1. global equities should outperform <span class="caps">US</span> ones,
    2. emerging markets (<span class="caps">EM</span>) should outperform developed ones (demographics, deficits, trade),
    3. <span class="caps">EM</span> ex-Asia should outperform <span class="caps">EM</span> within Asia: rotation play,
    4. Value will outperform growth (it&#8217;s gotta happen, eventually!),
    5. small cap will outperform mega cap,
    6. commodities will come back,
    7. <span class="caps">EM</span> <span class="caps">FX</span> should outperform. Deficits again, twins in most cases,
    8. <span class="caps">DX</span> should sag (the world consensus, except Brent Johnson),
    9. gold will trend down as real yields go up (production function, deflation, deficits),
    10. Treasuries will wilt under the weight of the deficits they have to&nbsp;fund.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m on board with all this, except perhaps gold. If real yields go up, so will the real cost of govt. debt financing, which will mean politically difficult tax rises. 
My money is probably on <span class="caps">CB</span>&#8217;s finally igniting inflation, but they&#8217;ve been spectacularly bad at doing this in the recent past. 
Govt.s could do it, but the short term spike in nominal rates might kill&nbsp;them.</p>
<p><img alt="bf75d011816db413785af3147e20ea0a.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/bf75d011816db413785af3147e20ea0a.png"></p>
<p>The correctness of this view has been combined into a composite chart. You&#8217;ll have to read Thomas&#8217; post for details. The thesis is that this view came right in about April&nbsp;2020.</p>
<h1>Bitcoin Satoshi&nbsp;Vision</h1>
<p>I dabble in a tiny, tiny way in cryptocurrencies. I like the idea of a distributed ledger with a democratic process for agreeing and confirming transactions. I also like the fact that it relies on public key encryption. I also like the idea that it was invented by a guy, who remains anonymous but is now semi-trillionaire, who made up an obviously fake name from bits of well known Japanese appliance&nbsp;manufacturers.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s clear that in their current form, the vast bulk of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies are unusably slow.
The cause of this is small blocks, and one currency, <span class="caps">BSV</span>, tries to fix that with … big blocks!
The result will be a less distributed ledger, but much quicker confirmation times, and throughput of transactions.
The currency that delivers this is <span class="caps">BSV</span>. 
It&#8217;s hard to have a huge (and endlessly growing) blocksize and at the same time let everyone run a full node on his <span class="caps">PC</span>.
The <span class="caps">BSV</span> tradeoff is to have fewer and more centralized servers, which means that <span class="caps">BSV</span> is not so good for money laundering or buying drugs, but if it is ever going to be usable in the way that was originally envisaged, I can&#8217;t see any alternative.
Buying <span class="caps">BSV</span> seems tricky: Coinbase doesn&#8217;t seem to support it. I have done the most cursory of&nbsp;checks.</p>
<p>To find out more about <span class="caps">BSV</span> checkout <a href="https://unboundedcapital.com/">Unbounded Capital</a>. 
I should warn that <span class="caps">BSV</span> is very, very controversial. Many bitcoiners despise the <span class="caps">BSV</span> crowd as heretics and want them burned at the stake. <span class="caps">BSV</span> certainly has low volume, and it&#8217;s capability of processing many transactions clearly makes it more vulnerable to attack by the <span class="caps">NSA</span> and/or the&nbsp;Kremlin. </p>
<h1>Unionization</h1>
<p>Paul Krugman wrote a newsletter commenting on how Joe Biden had implicitly encouraged workers at Amazon to unionize.
He reviewed why it was that union membership in the <span class="caps">US</span> private had cratered, in a way that was not replicated in Denmark (or Canada).
He concluded that it was because union-hostile Republican administrations had been in power for too long.
It seems a bit simplistic, but he has a point.
In the <span class="caps">UK</span>, we&#8217;ve had a mix of Labour and Conservative, but the Blairism was as hostile to unions as Thatcherism.
It&#8217;s hard to see the pendulum swinging back here, even if we get a Starmer govt., but it might just happen under Johnson, as he cares more about winning elections than being ideologically&nbsp;pure.</p>
<h1>Wrap (~20:30&nbsp;gmt)</h1>
<p>Another inflationary&nbsp;day:</p>
<ul>
<li>All major indexes down, although some rallying towards the&nbsp;close,</li>
<li><span class="caps">FAANG</span> stocks hammered, except $<span class="caps">FB</span>, $<span class="caps">TSLA</span>&nbsp;too,</li>
<li><span class="caps">DXY</span> up, to 91.6: on increased yields. The <span class="caps">FX</span> market is ignoring inflation. <span class="caps">BTC</span> down 4.9%, in spite of the fact that everyone sees it as an inflation hedge (&#8220;digital&nbsp;gold&#8221;),</li>
<li>bonds yields up, 10Y by 7bp, to&nbsp;1.54,</li>
<li>hydrocarbons all up (crude by 4.57%, to 64.1, except gas (down&nbsp;2.5%),</li>
<li>most ag. commods down, except&nbsp;soybeans,</li>
<li>gold <span class="amp">&amp;</span> copper both down heavily (copper by&nbsp;4.7%).</li>
</ul>
<p>Main news today&nbsp;was:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="caps">OPEC</span> which seems to have agreed to keep production unchanged in&nbsp;April,</li>
<li>Powell giving some testimony, saying that he&#8217;ll let inflation rip (well, I don&#8217;t think he actually said that, but that&#8217;s how the market&nbsp;reacted).</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="caps">ARKK</span>, the Ark <span class="caps">ETF</span>, which is down 5.7%, and was down further. It&#8217;s an active portfolio, but the <span class="caps">ETF</span> sponsor agrees to replicate the portfolio as held by Crazy Cathie.
Everyone expects her to reduce the more liquid stocks first, which will simply add volatility and illiquidity to the remaining portfolio, making it more and more vulnerable to a selling attack.
With bitcoin down quite a bit, the crypto equities were hit. $<span class="caps">MSTR</span> is down nearly 13%.
The market will probably recover, but today will have shaken out some of the&nbsp;RobinHooders.</p>
