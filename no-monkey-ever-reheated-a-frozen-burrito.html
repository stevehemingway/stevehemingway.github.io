<h2>Covid&nbsp;Conspiracy</h2>
<p><a href="https://harvard2thebighouse.substack.com/p/no-monkey-ever-reheated-a-frozen-624">This post</a> argues that gain-of-function research played a role in the origins of Covid-19.
It&#8217;s by Dan Sirotkin, who might or might not have attended Harvard, but who did spend time in prison, but is a join author of some serious-looking academic papers (e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03910v2.pdf">this one</a>). </p>
<p>Arthur C Clarke said that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. My corollary is that any sufficiently advanced scientific paper is indistinguishable from mumbo jumbo. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair">The Sokal Hoax</a> is a data point that supports this version, in a very strong&nbsp;form.</p>
<p>Anyway, I read the Covid paper, and it read as though it was based on solid science and some evidence, but the limits of my knowledge and willingness to do follow-up research means that it could equally well be a complete hoax. To believe it, you have to swallow something close to a conspiracy theory. Harold Wilson believed that he was being monitored by <span class="caps">MI5</span>, something that most right-thinking folk believe was a fantasy, but it seems that <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/mi5-kept-secret-file-on-harold-wilson-1797187.html">there might have been something to it</a>. <span class="caps">OK</span>, linking Harold with Covid seems a&nbsp;stretch!</p>
<p>I stole the title for today&#8217;s post from Sirotkin&#8217;s post heading. I didn&#8217;t actually know where it came from, but Google showed&nbsp;me:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>“It killed humans, therefore it was a weapon. But radiation killed humans, and a medical X-ray machine wasn’t intended as a weapon. Holden was starting to feel like they were all monkeys playing with a microwave. Push a button, a light comes on inside, so it’s a light. Push a different button and stick your hand inside, it burns you, so it’s a weapon. Learn to open and close the door, it’s a place to hide things. Never grasping what it actually did, and maybe not even having the framework necessary to figure it out. No monkey ever reheated a frozen burrito.”  
― James S.A. Corey, [Abaddon&#39;s Gate](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/17606564)
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>Today was mildly risk-on, with big swings in commodities, especially oil.
Yields were mostly up, global stock markets mostly drifting down still, although <span class="caps">US</span> markets were up, probably helped by the dollar weakening at bit.
Long-dated bonds, and credit (<span class="caps">AGG</span>) have continued their bull market, dating back may be six weeks.
The traditional &#8220;Santa rally&#8221; seems to be missing in action this year, unless it&#8217;s very late.
China seems so inept, corrupt and generally evil, it&#8217;s hard to see things returning fully to normal. Without China&#8217;s flood of cheap labour pushing up the price of the complementary capital it&#8217;s hard to see things ever returning to zero nominal interest rates&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>Gilts were weak, but the pound rallied a bit (just the dollar going down because of weak new claims figures). Generally, more vicious bear curve flattening in <span class="caps">US</span> rates.&nbsp;Ugh.</p>
<h2>Tech&nbsp;corner</h2>
<p>I installed Fedora 37 on an old Dell workstation. 
It&#8217;s great.
There is the odd glitch, though, affecting mounting samba shares (Windows fileservers).
Basically, the problem is that you must specific vers=2.0 on the mount line in your&nbsp;/etc/fstab:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>//winserve/sharename       /mnt/sharename      cifs    username=steve,password=********,gid=1000,uid=1000,vers=2.0      0       0
</code></pre></div>

<p>I should put this on stackexchange or something, but I don&#8217;t have enough kudos to post in those places, which is a&nbsp;pity.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s confusing is that nautilus will happily let you browse the share, but when you try to use a command line <code>mount</code> command, it fails, and worse, you get a warning that you may  need to specify <code>vers=1.0</code>. It seems that in fact the default is to use version 1.0, but that Windows rejects this protocol, because it&#8217;s unsafe, (but with a confusing error message).
You get something like &#8216;the server abruptly terminated the&nbsp;connection&#8217;.</p>
<p>The mount line in fstab must specify a gid and uid, because otherwise the files in the share will be owned by root, which is not good. There are plenty of articles on&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>I normally hit some barrier when using linux on my desktop, which may be very minor but which ultimately forces me back to Windows. This time, I feel, is actually&nbsp;different.</p>
<p>I use a lot of linux utilities, such as hledger (an accounting program). These have been ported to Windows, but the just don&#8217;t work as well, probably because the developers port them as a chore and shoot back to their preferred linux&nbsp;environment.</p>
