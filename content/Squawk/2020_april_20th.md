# 20th April 2020

Overview as of now \(4:20pm\): equities quiet, CL down 8%.

Your trades:

* trimmed TSLA to edge a big more -ve,
* sold some calls vs short cash because ... stonks!
* pyramiding the Incredible Hulks trade. Not sure it wouldn't be simpler just to short CL,
* bought one NG, following Kuppy's thesis that closing down oil wells will make NG more expensive.
* market seemed to be sagging so I sold a call against my long ES fut.
