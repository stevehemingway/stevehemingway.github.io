draft: false


The consultation period for the Main Modifications to the North Hertfordshire
Local Plan 2011  2031 has been extended. The consultation period will now run
until Thursday 11 April 2019.
This letter clarifies that the consultation also provides the opportunity to
respond to the new written evidence produced or submitted by the Council during
the Examination. This includes, but is not limited to, the ‘homework’
that was submitted following the close of the hearing sessions. Any consultation
responses which have already been received by the Council will be treated as
being received within the consultation period. Anyone who has already responded
can make additional comments during the extended consultation period if they
wish.

The proposed Main Modifications are drafted to ensure that the policies set out
in the Local Plan Proposed Submission Version and examined by the Inspector are
sound.
The schedule of Main Modifications is available to view:

   - on our website: *www.north-herts.gov.uk/localplan*

   - at the Council Offices during normal opening hours; and
   - in the District's libraries and at Stevenage Central, Stevenage Old

2017, on which comments are invited, are available to view at
