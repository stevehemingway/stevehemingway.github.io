# NHDC Local Plan – Public Consultation Period 19th October

to end November 



The local public meeting ahead of the Parish Council meeting went ahead

as planned on Wednesday 12th October. The hall was full, with many of

those attending having to stand. The only occasion I can recall coming

close to this level of attendance was the meeting to discuss the NHDC

Preferred Options, in the fourth quarter of 2014.



Paul Ward delivered an excellent summary of the Local Plan process. This

set the context and enabled members of the public to understand better

how they could participate effectively in the Local Plan consultation

process. Both of your District Councillors were present, and did their

best to answer the questions addressed to them.



The Parish Council, in its regular meeting after the public meeting,

decided to allocate a budget to cover the cost of a planning consultant

to help it produce its response to the Local Plan consultation which

started on the 19th October and will run until the end of November. All

residents are encouraged to read the Plan, which will be available in

the Library, and online, and to submit their representations. A new

improved online system for recording representations will be accessible

via the District Council's website, or an email to

localplan@north-herts.gov.uk, or a letter to Planning Policy, Local Plan

Consultation, North Hertfordshire District Council, PO Box 480, M33 0DE.

Please ensure that you make it very clear which section of the Plan your

representation relates to. As I have explained previously, these

representations will be collated by NHDC and submitted to the Planning

Inspector ahead of the Public Enquiry, which is currently expected to

take place in the second quarter of 2017.



# NHDC Revised Grants Policy 



The revised Grants Policy, now adopted, has reduced the total amount of

money available for grants from the Council, and restricted the groups

which are eligible. One of the big changes is that 'precepting bodies',

such as Parish Councils are not allowed to ask NHDC for grants. The

basis for this is that they already have the power to raise money from

local residents via Council Tax. Historically, parish councils have been

a big recipient of NHDC Grants, so even with a reduced budget there is

an opportunity for local community groups to obtain funding. The

grant-awarding committee which covers Knebworth, Codicote and other

southern parishes is Southern Rural. It still has a budget of around

&pound;18,000 to spend by the end of the Civic Year, so now is the time to

write your applications ready for the next committee meeting, which is

on 1st December.



Note that there is a separate committee which overseas capital grants

for village halls, community halls and the like. This is the Community

Facilities Capital Projects Fund. The current four-year programme has

one million pounds to disburse for capital projects. Parish councils are

permitted to apply for capital funding from this fund.
