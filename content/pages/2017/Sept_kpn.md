# Public Consultation on Revoking of NHDC Byelaws



NHDC has reviewed its byelaws, some of which date back to the 19th

Century, and have no relevance today. The recommendation is to revoke

all existing byelaws with the exception of the 2007 Acupuncture,

Tattooing, Semi-Permanent Skin-Colouring, Cosmetic Piercing and

Electrolysis byelaw.



In most cases the byelaws, many of which related to enforcement of

sanitary practices in commercial premises and to the prohibition of

antisocial behaviour in public places have been superseded by more

modern national statutes. For example, there is a 1874 byelaw that

relates to licencing of 'Omnibuses, Wagonettes & Stage Carriages and the

Proprietors, Drivers and Conductors thereof'.



NHDC are conducting a public consultation on this which ends on 22nd

September. Details can be accessed via the website and copies of the

survey, council report and the byelaws schedule are available at the

NHDC reception desk upon request during normal office hours.



# Upgrade to NHDC’s Planning Portal Software



Readers will be pleased to learn that NHDC has upgraded its planning

portal software. The system does not look noticeably different, but it

seems to be more responsive, and it certainly has had much better

'uptime' than previously. It is a pity that the upgrade coincided with

the consultation on the Station Pub redevelopment (ref. 17/01622/1). In

the end 181 responses were received which, hopefully, will have captured

all the valid planning issues that the application raised. No date has

yet been set for the Committee meeting at which the application will be

decided. Note that it is not possible to appeal against a decision to

grant an application, although it is possible to appeal against a

refusal.



Some local residents have questioned the need for respondents to

planning applications to provide their name and address to NHDC. I have

queried this and have been assured that, in fact, responses without an

address will still be taken into account. The only requirement is for

respondents to provide some contact details, so the officers can get in

touch if the response is ambiguous, or if an amendment to the

application is received. If you wish to make a representation, you

should be aware that your comments will be made public.



Another planning application in Knebworth that readers may wish to

consider is the redevelopment of the Chas Lowe site (reference

17/01863/1). The proposal is for the demolition of the existing

buildings and the erection of 48 assisted living extra care (Class C2)

apartments for the frail elderly, including communal facilities and car

parking along with ground floor commercial unit (Use A1, A2, A3, D1 or

D2) fronting London Road. The deadline for responding to this is the 6th

September.
