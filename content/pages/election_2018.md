## Update on election from 3 May

Knebworth Ward has fallen to the Lib Dems in spite of all the hard work put in by my supporters and me. A very intensive campaign from the Lib Dems paid off with a victory for first time candidate Lisa Nash. The full results were as follows:

Name of Candidate | Political Party |  Votes cast | Elected?
:-----------------: | ---------------:| -----------:| :---------:
Steve HEMINGWAY |  Conservative Party | 742  |      N

Lisa NASH     |  Liberal Democrats | 957     |   Y
Nick NEWSON   |  Green Party    |    29        | N

Electorate: 3992 | Ballot papers counted:1876 | Ballot papers rejected:0 | Turnout: 46.99%

The overall North Hertfordshire results were: five down for Conservatives, with three and two gains respectively for the Lib Dems and Labour.
The makeup of the council is now:

* Conservative 29
* Labour 14
* Lib Dem 6

I will fight again should I be lucky enough to be selected again as your candidate.

To all my supporters: thanks  for all your votes and  support with the campaign. Please get in touch if you'd like to help me next time.
