# About this blog

I am Steve Hemingway. Thanks for taking the time to find me.

I decided to make a few notes to myself, to keep track of what is going on in the markets mainly, but also about anything else that comes into my head.

The software I use, Pelican, is perfectly setup for collaboration.
All the content is in git and in [a repo in github](https://github.com/stevehemingway/stevehemingway.github.io).

I am now on Pelican 4.8.0. It's an improvement.
I am using the notymyidea theme, which is built in (so you don't hav)
