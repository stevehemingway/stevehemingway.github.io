# Sign up to my newsletter (eventually)

I signed up with Substack but for the moment I can't be bothered to convert each post into a newsletter. 
I'm kinda hoping to link my blog, probably via the RSS feed, into a substack newsletter.
Well, probably substack.
But, whatever provider I use, I can't be bothered to set up each post manually.

You can always email me direct, at steve@acksam.com,
or steve@stevehemingway.com (well, I own the domain name, so why not?).
