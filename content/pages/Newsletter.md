# Sign up to my newsletter

I signed up with Substack. I generally cut and paste my blog here into it.
It's not the most automated workflow, but it's OK so far
For some reason I chose [sceptical](https://sceptical.substack.com) as my subdomain, for reasons that somewhat escape me now.

I did try using convertkit, which is nice, but substack offers a combined blog and newsletter, perfectly integrated.
For the time being, I'm sticking with Pelican but eventually I might go fully to substack. The thing that is stopping me is that I hate the idea of being locked in to a platform. 


You can always email me direct, at steve@acksam.com.
