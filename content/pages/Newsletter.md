# Sign up to my newsletter

I signed up with Substack. I generally cut and paste my blog here into it.
It's not the most automated workflow, but it's OK so far
For some reason I chose [stevehemingway](https://stevehemingway.substack.com) as my subdomain.

I did try using convertkit, which is nice, but substack offers a combined blog and newsletter, perfectly integrated.
For the time being, I'm sticking with Pelican but eventually I might go fully to substack. The thing that is stopping me is that I hate the idea of being locked in to a platform. 

I have an aspiration of writing every day I am sitting at my desk. This means that nothing appears on the weekend or when I am on holiday. 

I mainly recycle ideas from sources I've consumed. Often newsletters, podcasts, tweets, books but _sometimes_ entirely by me _ex nihilo._

You can always email me direct, at steve@acksam.com,
or steve@stevehemingway.com (well, I own the domain name, so why not?).
