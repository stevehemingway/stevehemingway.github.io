Brazil - stockmarket vs BRE. Review arguments made by Dahlia Capital on this week's Market Huddle!

[Beyond Overton](https://beyondoverton.com/2020/06/08/liquidity-down-equities-up-fed-around-the-corner/) has long been worried that for all the shock and awe of Fed money-printing, still conditions are too tight,
but that the Fed is painted into a corner because if it loosens too much it will lose control of USTs. 
I don't pretend to be an expert on this, but I feel that the bond market 'knows' a lot more than the equity market,
which aggregates so many opposing forces.

Zillow ($Z) might be worth a lot: deep moat. See [this thread](https://twitter.com/guessworkinvest/status/1272593240949063680).

Fed intervening again.  More bad news around $TSLA, stock goes up. Not bullish for DXY.

Bonds can't rally. 30-year Treasuries are struggling. Worth shorting?

Wrap: crazy day with the bears (rational investors) in a life-or-death struggle with bulls (deploying their crack troops: the Fed and the US Treasury). 
It's hard to get ripped to pieces by one of these massive forces, but for the moment the bulls are in the ascendant. 
I'm not sure it can carry on forever, but who knows?
