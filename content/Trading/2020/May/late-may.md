title: Late May update
category: markets

Trying to keep delta neutral wrt SPX.

Some exposure to commods via PAAS, VALE, KL, GLD but very little.

Hanging onto Incredible Hulks trade, but yet to see much return (grrr, Kuppy!).

Slight exposure to energy via RDXUSD. 

Really hanging on for markets to get rational.

I'm desperate to short some fraudulent stocks. I've created a list on Koyfin, the composition of which may change, 
but  can be viewed  [here](https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5e8606e2ce89552d175a9ba4).
