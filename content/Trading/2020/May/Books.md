## Books I'm reading

I try to write a few paragraphs about every book I've read in [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com). 
My review can all be found [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/30000791-stephen-hemingway?shelf=read).  
You can see all the books I've added [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/30000791?shelf=%23ALL%23). 
In nearly every case, I have a copy of the book, either on my Kindle or in hard copy.
If you'd like to borrow one, just email me.





## Monetizing the debt

A few blogs/posts I enjoyed today:

* [US Debt exceeds $25T](https://themarketear.com/posts/cE462EMD95).
* [The sheer scale of Fed BS expansion has to be seen to be believed](https://themarketear.com/posts/ceSA55zTYl).
* [1971 seems a key date in the strangeness in world markets](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/).
