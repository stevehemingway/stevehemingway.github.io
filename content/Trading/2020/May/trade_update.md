Not traded for a bit. Some small trades:

* bought TLT put. Too scared to sell UB fut.
* sold NVDA call. Made some cash from an expiring short call.
* bought some TSLA CFD
* bought some HCC. Want to be long some equity.
* bought an HG fut, sold some calls, to hedge & get some +ve theta.
* bought some VALE and GDX. Small size.

General theme: equities have no direction. 
Commodities not exactly firm, but have more of a direction.

[Kuppy talks about hedging tankers](https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2020/05/07/takin-my-foot-off-the-gas/). I bought a teeny stake in SD.
