Your stop order bought 2 ES overnight, and you added one, as the trend is still relentlessly bullish in the US.
To balance up, you sold one FTMIB.
You trimmed your gold holding, but bought one SI contract. 
It's very volatile, but Fleck suggested there would be delivery problems with SI or GC for the June expiry.

You put some stops and limits in in the hope of favourable (or unfav.) moves trimming your exposure automatically.

As of 12:16, your winning positions are ES, TSLA, FXI, GC and NG. 

Your losing ones are EURN (EU CFD) and CL, with a contrib. from BA and BTP.

It takes a peculiar mindset to go long when the real economy is so shattered.
