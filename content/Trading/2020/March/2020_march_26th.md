Still reeling from the huge rally on Tuesday. Initial unemployment claims hit _3.3 million_ and the SPX goes up by 4%. This is truly an incomprehensible market.

PnL badly hurt by positions in RUT and TSLA and BA, all of which have rallied. The latter two, because they are so close to zero, by big percentages. Exposure to all via puts, except for BA where the put was exercised.
