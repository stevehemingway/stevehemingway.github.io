Note that I didn't make any contemporaneous digital record. I did make some notes on paper with a pen though, and that's what I'll use as the basis of this note.

## Early

* Sold ESTX50 and ES via stop,
* closed UB, DX at profit via stop,
* closed FTMIB & SX7P fut at loss, via stop
* sold 1 R fut

## mid morning

* Bought 1 NQ, because equity markets seemed to be recovering with all the stimulus announcements,
* bought 3 ESTX 50 on same basis

## post lunch

* ES and NQ closed: prices very volatile, even though stops were wide,
* bought a TSLA put with a cheeky bid \(TSLA rallying strongly\),
* RCL closed, with small profit
* AAPL puts stopped out. In profit, but I think AAPL has further to go down

## early eve \(maybe\)

* sold ESTX50 via stop

## at the close

Markets were very, very volatile today. You were down a lot, and a lot of short positions closed by stop. However, the ES closed down by 4.5% \(maybe\), so it looks as though the bear is still in the ascendant and that today \(and yesterday\) really was a bear market rally. Of course nothing is certain, and IB has now really cranked up margin requirements on open positions, which means that even though my shorts look modest my maintenance margin amount looks humongous.

At some point there are going to be some very great bargains to be had, but maybe not yet, and maybe not for another quarter or two.
