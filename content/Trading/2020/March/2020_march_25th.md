See yesterday's entry. Biggest rally since 1933 continues. Everyone calling it a bear market rally, but no sign of it losing steam as Larry Kudlow tells the press that he's expecting $6MMM of stimulus.

Peter Schiff going bonkers as the market rallies without gold following. I'm not fully convinced by him, but in the long run I think he's right.

At least I got on and did some other productive things, not least updating MediaWiki to 1.34 on the Knebworth Village site.
