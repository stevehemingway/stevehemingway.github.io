The week begins! The tail end of last week was pretty brutal, but nothing over the weekend gives any succour to the bulls.

Last Friday stops resulted in your getting a couple of short positions in ES and NQ. Small profit. Set up stops, just in case.

You hedged your positions with 5 MXEA futures. This was showing a hefty loss, although you were net up, so you sold 3.

CL is going down, down, down! It's interesting that nobody saw this. Econ Group talks didn't have a clue.

Very negative report in ZH about the Chinese consumer missing credit servicing payments.

Silver and gold not responding as would be expected. DX losing its winning streak. Silver miners seem strong.

Decided to hedge out the 'commodity element' of gold by taking an equal nominal short position in HG \(long GC/short 3 HG\). Not sure this will work.

Sold MHI, 1 lot. I am still negative on China, but the market there seems to be holding up. Not sure I really want to fight the PBoC.
