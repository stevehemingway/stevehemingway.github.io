title:  23rd March 2020 \(Monday\) March 2020

Usual drill: checked Twitter and tried to get a feel for the open. Mondays are spoopy because the US is still in the weekend. Feeling was bearish \(but ... I'm a perma-bear so what's new\). Hopefully, today will be free of any further massive govt. stimulus and bailout operations. But you never can tell what's coming next.

OK. Trades were:

Sold: DX, ES, DAX, DJ600, ESTX50, CAC40. Protective buys using trailing stops set up for all.

Sold a couple of calls on AIR \(Airbus Industrie\) because selling the stock short is now banned. IV is 140%, so expensive and uses up a lot of margin, so max upside very limited.

Sold 36\(!\) SX7P futures, because these were just hedging your puts.
