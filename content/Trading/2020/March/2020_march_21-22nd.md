Ideas picked up:

* Dollar demand is still high,
* lots of industries, particularly automotive in Europe, have a lot of debt coming due. Also insurance, tech, capital goods. More stress coming, as longer rates move up,
* big upward moves in SPX are characteristic of a bear market.
* 10Y-3M spread going -ve has 100% record of forecasting recessions!
* Bunds are showing stress - very large upward moves, but still -ve.
* Lots of oil states are going to have budget crises. Oman, KSA, UAE, Iraq. Russia is relatively safe.
* Trillions and trillions in stimulus are going to trigger inflation.
