## All day

[AGG](https://koyfin.com/s/hZqgi4N7uT) is trading at a 60-day vol of 4.4%.  Long calls, anyone?

![DX is a consensus short](https://d1yhils6iwh5l5.cloudfront.net/charts/resized/71055/large/7_20_2020_2_33_21_PM.png).
It's not tumbling, but it's on a trend. 
This implies yield curve steepening. 
One to keep watching, rather than one to act on right away, I think.

## Wrap

Crazy risk on day today. $TSLA up another 10%. 
Nasdaq up 3.10%. 
Presumably, this is all on vaccine hopes. 
But not many people died: so reducing that number won't make much difference, either,
unless of course lockdowns are ended, which will be politically difficult.

Spain tries out a UBI scheme. It's not 100% clear how it will operate,
but it seems to be a genuine large-scale trial. 
I await the result with interest.
