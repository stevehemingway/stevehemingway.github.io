## Morning

Risk on (as usual). 
Bonds *almost* flat.
Commods up generally, apart from the crude complex. 
Copper jumps because of some trouble in Chile.
Equities up, vaccine rumours.
Dollar flat.
It's Monday. Nothing will be clear until the US opens.

## Wrap

Huge puke in the main equity indexes late in the day.
$TSLA plunged.
Gold spiked.
Bonds didn't (much) react.
No real explanation for the move: some reversals on opening up Florida, but hard to imagine this is the driver.
