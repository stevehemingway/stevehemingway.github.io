# Markets are extended


[Alex Manzara points out](https://www.chartpoint.com/all-the-same-trade/) that almost every market is extended.
The exception is long dated treasuries.
But all assets seem to be at multi-year highs or lows.
Alex is a rates man, but he comments that oil looks cheap now, relative to copper, which everyone has bought because the future is electric, man.

His view is:

- long-dated rates have room to go higher,
- P/Es look stretched, even if they are supported by ZIRP,
- if one market corrects (e.g. the SPX wilts), can the others remain unaffected?
- silver is laggard, as is corn and soybeans.

All of this chimes with me, but I doubt if any of it is actionable.

# Spacmania

Every man and his dog is launching a SPAC.
