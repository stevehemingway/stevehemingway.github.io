# Most hated, vs most loved sectors

[This tweet](https://twitter.com/HFI_Research/status/1322248709799780352) makes the case that the outperformance of tech (represented by $XLK) against (conventional) energy (represented by $XLE) has gone too far.
It's hard to time this sort of reversal, but it is hard to see this going on for much longer.

In a separate tweet, someone pointed out that $TSLA is now worth as much as all the energy sector put together. 
However you look at this, one of them has to be mis-priced.
