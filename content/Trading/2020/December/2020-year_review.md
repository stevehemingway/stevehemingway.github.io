# What a crazy year!

## January

- $TSLA gained 55%,

## February

- $SPCE opened the month at $17.15 and finished it at 42.49. The first of the exploding SPAC attacks,

## March

- All markets crashed, stock markets closed, puts were no offer, the end of the world was nigh,

## April

WTI futures went to $-40. You literally had to pay anyone to take oil off your hands,


## May

The NDX (well, $QQQ) hit a monthly all time high. The markets were roaring back.

## June

$NKLA shot up  135% before falling back to earth.

## July


## August
$AAPL and $TSLA did stock splits. The shares immediately started levitating upwards. 
People wondered about whether RobinHooders fully grasped the concept of share dilution.

## September

Tiktok exploded.

## October

$SNAP and Pinterest jumped higher during this month. 

## November

Markets toyed with all time highs (in the case of the $DJIA it made it). 

## December

- $BABA was destroyed because Jack Ma complained about how Chinese banks allocate credit,
- AirBnB and DoorDash had big pops at their IPOs,
- Bitcoin continued to rocket higher.


# Overall

Commodities did better, but still did not shine as much as they might have.
Equity markets are more overbought than they have ever been. ![img](https://thefelderreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-11-02-at-10.40.44-AM-1024x741.png)
There is more margin debt than there has ever been ![img](https://thefelderreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-04-at-8.10.48-AM-1024x739.png).

And the stockmarket is at its all-time high as a percentage of GDP ![img](https://thefelderreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-11-02-at-10.02.54-AM-1024x741.png) 

(and yes, I know that the stockmarket is very unrepresentative of the economy, but that's a whole different issue).

All these charts shamefully stolen from [The Felder Report](https://thefelderreport.com/2020/11/04/this-is-the-textbook-definition-of-late-cycle-in-the-stock-market/).
