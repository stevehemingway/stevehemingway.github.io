# Money supply

I'm old enough to remember when the money supply mattered, and was the determinant of inflation, albeit with 'long and variable lags'. 
Now, nobody ([except Taps Coogan](https://thesoundingline.com/m1-money-supply-growth-surges-to-eye-watering-69)) cares. 
But all things, including economic theories, move into and out of fashion, so maybe the time has come.

# The problem of social cost

The US has the most expensive healthcare in the world, _per capita_, by far. Yet the outcomes are terrible. Coase understood why. For some (maybe many) goods and services, the market mechanism is far from the best way of providing them. 
I am a huge fan of Milton Friedman, who thought very clearly about economics, but he assumed away transaction costs far too readily, in my wholly unqualified opinion.

# Crumbs

$FCX closed at it's highest point since 2014.
If Dr Copper has a PhD, Freeport McMoRan has a tenured professorship.
$LMND shot up about 10% yesterday. It is trading on an EV to Sales (NTM) of around 44. Value play!

Kuppy wrote a review of the year, which for him was a good one. You can read all about it [here](https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2020/12/31/2020-position-review/). If you just want to ride on his coattails, he's long:  CNR, GBTC, LPG, SD, JOE.
