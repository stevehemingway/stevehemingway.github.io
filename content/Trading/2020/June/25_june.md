## Stuff


[Kuppy argues](https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2020/06/24/ready-for-the-re-bal/) that you can make money by watching stocks enter and leave the Russell 2000. 


[Kuppy is good on how Robin Hood is messing with markets](https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2020/06/19/stocks-only-go-up/). Only US markets so far but ...


To counter the "stocks only go up" narrative, in fact they have gone nowhere in a couple of years, with the exception of the "Giant Five." Wolf Richer points this out, but I'm too lazy to find the link. He has also produced a post on how insanely uncertain managers are about future sales. Something not exactly surprising.


[Charlie Bilello points out](https://compoundadvisors.com/2020/are-tech-stocks-immune-to-recession?ck_subscriber_id=694496162) that tech stocks have certainly not been immune to a downturn in the past, and are (surely) unlikely to be this time.


## News


Looks like cases are going up in the US, or at least the headlines signal this. Maybe the reality is more nuanced.


## Late wrap (19:36 BST)


$ESTX50 and $ES down, everything else up. $ZN practically flat. $DXY up 0.25%. $GLD down 0.19%. 
Basically, nothing is moving. Better be theta positive. Oil up 2%, but only $39.
Tankers down damn you, Kuppy!
