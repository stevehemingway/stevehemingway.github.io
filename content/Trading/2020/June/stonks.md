The George Floyd riots continued over the weekend but made virtually no difference to the US markets.
US stock averages are a bit muted, vs ROW. Transports & SPX are flat as of now (16:06 2020-06-01).
Other markets did somewhat better, especially Latam. 

Generally, everything is risk on. 
TLT, which is risk-off and also inflation sensitive, was down a bit.

Commodities, incl. HG were up. Also gold and silver, which is very odd. 

Soft commods are mixed. Soybean (YK) are up, but wheat (YW) is down. 
Both have lacked much direction recently, especially the former.
