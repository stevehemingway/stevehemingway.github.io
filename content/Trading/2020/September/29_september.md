# Wrap

I didn't pay any attention to the markets today.
Generally, it was slightly risk off.
Soft commodities up a bit.
Most indexes down. Some of the tech megastocks up.
$XOM down 3%, all the oil majors down heavily.
$SLB down 5.2%!

Maybe something more exciting will happen tomorrow.
The FT is running move coverage of gold. Maybe this will spark some investor interest.
