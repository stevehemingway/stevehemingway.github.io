# Wrap

Today was definitely risk off.
Everything down again, including commodities (except NG which has a life of its own: up 18%, on weather in the gulf, apparently).
Developed Europe looking weak.
Emerging markets all very weak.
Japan an exception, not sure why. Maybe the BoJ started buying ETFs more.

Tech getting hammered. FAANG down a lot!
