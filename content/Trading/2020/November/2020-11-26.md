# What I've been following on Twitter

You can follow me on Twitter. But don't. I am not going to lead you anywhere interesting.
I have, however, curated a few lists of people who know stuff. The full set is [here](https://twitter.com/FrancisMansell/lists). 
I have a few lists I've put together, the one I use myself most is [this one that brings together a group of real time news sources](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1133302441296969728). 
The others are more for the laughs, but your humour may vary.

Today I read:
