## Morning in Europe

Everything quiet as the grave.
The SPX breaking through its ATH yesterday was met with a shrug, with everything slightly down,
except the FTSE, which was down 1%.
That is except Borsa Istanbul, which was up 0.6%, in TRY terms.
In EUR terms, not so much, which also goes for the SPX.
The Euro is up a lot against the dollar this year. 
Robin Brooks was quoted in the FT as saying that it's unsustainable,
which I guess is another way of saying that the ECB is going to lose the race to devalue its currency to the Fed.
Clearly, the Fed has a lot going for it, not least over a hundred years of doing its own thing. 
However, the dollar has a lot going for it too, not least the US military, 
which means a lot, I think, even in today's world.


## Afternoon thoughts

$TSLA is *sui generis.* 
Although there are many companies that make battery electric vehicles, there are none quite as extraordinary as $TSLA. 
Maybe Musk is a genius, maybe he's a charlatan. 
Edison was a bit of both.
The story of the company is going to make a blockbuster film, one day, but for the moment you have to be satisfied with less visual sources. 
I would recommend [this podcast](https://quoththeraven.podbean.com/e/quoth-the-raven-216-montana-skeptic/) for one side of the argument, but put by a measured sane individual (the Skeptic), being interviewed by a rather more excitable individual (Chris Irons). 
The QTR podcast series is rather uneven in quality, providing a platform for some out and out conspiracy theorists that the mainstream media would not touch with a bargepole. 
My view is that we should be grown up enough to make up our own minds.
Please do so for the episode above.

[Wolf Richer](https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/19/the-fed-made-sure-the-rich-got-richer-during-the-pandemic-why-thats-bad-for-the-economy/) says that most of us didn't actually get richer, from the Fed's actions. 
The divergence is not so extreme in Europe, but I can't believe that the BoE really reduced inequality by its actions.
[There is generational inequality too, for sure](https://alkhaleejtoday.co/business/5033088/The-road-to-inflation-in-post-COVID-times.html).


## Close 

Everything went into reverse today. 
Turkish Lira rallied, against the odds,
commodities rallies, apart from precious metals,
the dollar index went up by 0.5%.
Equities were generally up, with the exception of China and China-related (e.g. HK & Singapore).
Volumes probably thin, but I didn't bother to check. 
A time when market manipulators can have a big impact.

FOMC minutes released today. Chatter about yield curve control, somehow supposed to explain drop in precious metals. I will read the FT tomorrow to try to understand the logic.
