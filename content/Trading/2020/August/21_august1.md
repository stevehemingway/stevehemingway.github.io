## It's Saturday!

The markets were closed today. 
It's been a rough week.
My evening read today is ["The Mind of Wall Street"](https://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=levy+&title=mind+of+wall+street&lang=en&isbn=&destination=gb&currency=GBP&mode=basic&st=sr&ac=qr). 
Unusually (for me), it's hardcopy (but not hardback). If you're local (well, say UK) and you'd like to read it drop me a line & I'll lend it to you for free. I will take a few days to read it. Initial chapters are very encouraging.

Good night!
