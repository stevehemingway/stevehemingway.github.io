## Google Cloud Computing

I like to drop into a shell from time to time.
Like the old hacker I am, for minor edits I find nothing more convenient that vi (pax Stallman).
I don't necessarily want to log a PC around with me wherever I go, so I wondered if I could find a free terminal account.
Google Cloud Shell seems to do the trick.
You can access from a browser, and you get a fairly complete Debian instance.
I have cloned a branch of the repository that this blog is in, and I am creating this post from within the cloud shell.

I haven't tried to install pelican, although python seems to be pre-installed. 
I may try that, but if I can create content via a familar environment using any browser I can log into my google account,
I'll be very happy.

Yes, I don't like Google monetizing my private data, but this is so damn fast and convenient!
Oops.
