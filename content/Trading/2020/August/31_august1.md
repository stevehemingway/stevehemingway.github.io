# Honk Kong not so fragrant real estate market

[Central HK office space is getting cheaper](https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/29/nows-not-a-good-time-to-sell-office-towers-in-hong-kong-battered-from-all-directions/).
It's hardly a surprise that this is happening, although maybe it is a surprise that it's happening so late.
I don't follow this market, although I am vaguely aware that the HK economy is largely based on real estate services.
HK is the most liquid market in the Far East, and if this news causes weakness in the Hang Seng, it could trigger larger falls in other ASEAN markets.
