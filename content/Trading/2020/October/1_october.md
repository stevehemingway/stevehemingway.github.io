# HK real estate looking shaky

[Goldin Financial Holdings experiences creditors seizing assets](https://www.mingtiandi.com/real-estate/finance-real-estate/goldin-headquarters-put-on-market/).
This huge chunk of real estate is on sale at a 34% discount to book value (as of nine months ago).
Can this be the top of HK real estate?
The coup by China, the deteriorating state of world trade, the murky corporate governance of anything to do with Chinese business must all be weighing down on the viability of HK as an international financial centre.
