## From yesterday

Markets ground higher. Dunno why, that's just what they do. 
The writing expensive calls strategy seems to be working. 
Got nervous and put more trailing stops in place. 
I collected [a list of gold and silver miners](https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5ee9e268769b5613837afb5c).
They probably are worth looking into a bit. Some are very small, so one would be mad to have more than a tiny flutter on those. 
There is some evidence that an old drug helps those who are on ventilators as a result of catching Covid-19. 
A slender pillar to support a rally.

## Today

Some news of the UK govt. cutting some spending on pensions.
Powell gave some testimony to the Congress banking committee, didn't say very much of note (as far as I can tell).
Stocks grind higher.
The appearance before the Senate banking panel seems not to have yet caused any excitement.
From the odd fevered comment on Twitter he's doubling down. 
I saw something about him saying that he did not see any shrinking of the balance sheet,
which is scarcely controversial. 

## Interesting reads

[This article on apartment rent levels in the USA](https://wolfstreet.com/2020/06/01/rents-in-the-most-expensive-cities-drop-oil-patch-gets-hit-too-but-massive-gains-in-other-cities/) came out a while ago. Wolf Richer produces some amazing research. 
I'm not really interested in the US rental market, but it might shed some light on the UK one,
which I am interested in.
