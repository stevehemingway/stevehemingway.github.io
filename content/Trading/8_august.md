## All day

It's Saturday. I didn't pay attention to markets today.
There weren't any open.
I did read a few articles in the FT saying that inflation was coming,
but that buying gold is an unreliable way of profiting from that.
I also read one saying that the AA is doomed, and was the day that private equity purchased it.
Well, that's a novel insight!
