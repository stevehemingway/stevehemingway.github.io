# Wrap

This is the first day of the Biden presidency. It was pretty quiet, but slightly risk on, i.e. deflationary but mainly flat:

- EUR up 0.5%,
- Brent up 0.5% but WTI down 0.5%!
- Most international markets up ~0.2%,
- Gold up 0.1%,
- US 10 year, 1.107% -- up a fraction,
- $TIP up 0.2% (i.e. inflationary),
- Credit down a tad ($HYG down 0.1%, $LQD down 0.4%).
- Global curves steepened in unison, even core Eurozone joined the party!

News: not much. ECB announced their were leaving rates on hold. Nobody expected that!
