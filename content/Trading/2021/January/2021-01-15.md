Retail sales fell unexpectedly in Dec 2020. Online trade actually slumped a lot: by 5.8%. 
It looks as though getting through the full Biden stimulus measures will be tougher than was at first thought.
The NRA declared bankruptcy.

[CNN issues correction of the week, noting that Rep. Ted Lieu grabbed a ProBar energy bar and not a crowbar](https://www.businessinsider.com/cnn-correction-ted-lieu-grabbed-probar-not-crowbar-capitol-siege-2021-1). Well, I thought it was funny.

Probably because of the retail sales decline, this was a risk-off (deflationary outlook) day:

- Virtually all equity indexes down, incl. Japan, China & Australia up, but timezone effects?
- Dollar was up: real intrest rates going up, will drive down inflation, will lift dollar,
- Commodities mixed. Crude down 2.7%, but gas up 3.3% (surging demand in Japan). Nickel was up a lot (3.5%),
- US yields dropped, because of the deflationary implications of a drop in demand.
