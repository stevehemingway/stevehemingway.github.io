# Crumbs

- [Palm Valley, a long-only small cap fund, explains why everything is too expensive and inflation is coming](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4398644-palm-valley-capital-fund-q4-2020-commentary?utm_medium=email&utm_source=seeking_alpha&mail_subject=fund-letters-palm-valley-capital-fund-q4-2020-commentary). You've heard the thesis before, but this makes the case with some Ã©lan.

# Wrap

- News: Trump to be impeached a second time, just before Biden's inauguration,
- inflation running at 1.4% in Dec. vs 1.2% forecasted,
- dollar up: because inflation move might cause earlier tightening??
- stocks mixed,
- US Fed. govt. running a huge deficit vs. last year (hardly a surprise),
- dollar up (relief rally?), commodities down,
- bonds up (tightening again?).

Summary: somewhat risk off, market spooked by Trump news or inflation.
