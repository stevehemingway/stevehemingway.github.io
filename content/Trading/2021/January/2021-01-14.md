- Heard the one about the wooden car? Wooden body, wooden wheels, wooden engine, wooden go! Now we are going to have [wooden satellites](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2021/01/13/a-japanese-forestry-firm-wants-to-put-wooden-satellites-into-orbit),

# Wrap

The reflation trade is back on:

- crude (WTI) up 1.2%, to $53.6,
- 30 year Treasurys down 0.65% (futures),
- value sectors (energy, real estate, financials, industrials all up, between 3% and 0.3%),
- volatility (VIX) up to 23.45, 
- some RobinHood favourites up insanely -- $GME (Gamestop) has doubled,
- $BTC going crazy: $39.1K, up 8%,
- Curves steepening: 10s 2s up 72bp (on the week: Koyfin doesn't show daily moves).

So, in summary, the rumours that the Fed was going to taper have been quashed. 
It's a twitchy market though. My feeling is that the smart money is unloading onto the bagholders.
