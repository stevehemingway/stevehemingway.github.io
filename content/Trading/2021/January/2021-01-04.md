[This article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/upshot/why-markets-boomed-2020.html?mc_cid=135c40d5a7&mc_eid=8d66df2c11)  by By [Neil Irwin](https://www.nytimes.com/by/neil-irwin) and [Weiyi Cai](https://www.nytimes.com/by/weiyi-cai) explains how it can be that shutting down so much of the US economy can result in US consumers having an extra $1Trn to spend or save. Basically,  there was a lot of govt. support, and a relatively small number wealthy people saw a surge in their earnings which was sufficient to offset a mass

[Alex Manzara](https://www.chartpoint.com/) has produced [a wonderful 1st post of 2021](https://www.chartpoint.com/banquets/). Read it and savour it. Summary:

- M2 in the US is exploding. There will be consequences,
- Gold, SPX, BBG Agricultural Index (BCOMAG) is up 15% on the year, 40% up on the lows,
- Base metals are up 50% on their lows,
- Commodities still are cheap compared with equities,
- The Fed actually has three mandates: the (badly) hidden one is financial stability. [They don't really try to hide it](https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2017/eb_17-06).


[Jesse Felder's thoughts](https://thesoundingline.com/some-thoughts-on-2021/?utm_source=mailpoet&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=new-post-some-thoughts-on-2021_585):

- Jack Ma is now an outlaw, on the run from the CCP (well, missing, anyhow). $BABA probably went up.
- USA vs. China is going to become military, and spending is going up,
- The EU made a mistake by signing a trade deal with China,
- governments are going to continue to bribe voters with their own money.

[Stocktwits](https://dailyripblog.com/2021/01/02/stocktwits-top-25-week-52/) weekly wrap notes that $FCX, Freeport McMoRan is going up steeply. Freeport is a big copper miner.

FCA and PSA merge to form Stellantis. Experts have been predicting a consolidation of the global auto manufacturing industry. Maybe this is the modest slide that turns into a global avalanche. a


# Wrap

- Most global equity markets down, but modestly,
- Energy holding up well. OPEC meeting today: presumably hopes of holding the line,
- yield curves relatively unchanged,
- Govt. bond yields down in EU core, up almost everywhere else,
- Corp. yields all creeping up, virtually globally.
- USD down a bit vs. EUR but only by 22bp.

General tone: risk off. 

Stocks getting interest: $CMAC (Playboy SPAC), $TSLA (up, with most tech stocks down). 
Worries about GA runoff election. $400M spent on campaigns for 2 senators. Ugly.

My guess for tomorrow: $BTC will crash. Not advice.
