## Markets update

The reflation trade made a showing today:

- bonds a tiny bit lower (US TY 10Y yield up a few bp),
- most commodities up (except gold),
- bitcoin ('digital gold') down 7% to $56K, but Dogecoin (designed to be worthless) hits new ATHs,
- European equity indexes generally positive. Spain up 1%,
- US equities treading water (NDX down 1%),
- Some Ponzi sector stocks down a bit ($TSLA down 3.6%),
- $ORA, (Ormat Technologies ) down 2.4 SD. Some short sellers suggest it is a fraud stock, $ROOT and $INTZ also down heavily: both possible fraud stocks,
- $MO down 6% on news that Biden will reduce nicotine levels in cigarettes. Buying opportunity, as these are very international stocks?
