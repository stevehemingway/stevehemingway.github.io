# Crumbs

- [Tesla doesn't have a captive financing arm, and so has less debt, but that's a bad thing](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4417862-captive-financing-arms-avoiding-pitfalls-in-comparing-teslas-balance-sheet-to-those-of-auto-oems). Basically, the debt to finance the car finance business is counted, but the loans and leases that were bought with the proceeds of that debt are not counted.  Keubiko is worth following on Twitter.

# Wrap

A risk off day:

- 10Y yield down,
- Gold & silver up a bit,
- US stocks flat, at best,

but: 

- commodities up, a bit inc. oil,
- European stocks up,
- lithium jumps, up 6%,
- DXY down 0.3%, at 92.3.

No major news flow that I could find. 
GS and MS getting a lot of negative publicity for dumping Archegos positions.

It seems that [GS bought a lot of Deliveroo stock to support the price after listing](https://www.ft.com/content/bf75f260-33d8-42ea-85c3-6482aa1fb2ff).

Greensill and GFG companies increasingly look like as though they were engaged in fraud, at the very least. Cameron looking finished. 

Yellen has called for a global minimum corporation tax rate. Not sure this has made much difference to markets, as it seems unlikely that this is politically possible, certainly on a Marxists interpretation of history. 
The largest corporations derive huge profits from corporation tax arbitrage, and they are certainly not going to give that up without a struggle and a tsunami of lobbying.
