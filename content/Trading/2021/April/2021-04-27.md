# The day

## Wrap 

The reflation narrative seems to be taking off:

- DXY down, to 90.87,
- 10Y Treasury up to 1.63%,
- virtually all commodities up: GSCI up 0.75% today, 20% YTD. Except gold, stuck on $1776/oz,
- equities generally flat. Blowout numbers from GOOG, up 3.6%, could not support the rest of the market.

## Deluard

Vincent Deluard of Stonex is always worth listening to on The Market Huddle.
He was on last week arguing that:

- China and satellites suppressed their currencies in the 90's to keep their large young populations employed,
- China imposed capital controls to prevent the sort of situation which occured in Japan in the 80s, which resulted in decades of pain,
- these trends will reverse in the coming decade, resulting in Chinese assets, and currency appreciating, to allow the retirees to spend in their dotage,
- this is essentially the 'Great Moderation' run in reverse, with 1bn productive young workers taken out of the global labour force,
- the loss cheap productive capacity will result in inflation,
- East Asian assets, of all sorts will go up (but watch out for equities, and China repression),
- this inflation will spread to the West,
- some LTAM assets will be worth looking at as they are long real and short dollar exposure: e.g. BRL, CLP.

Worth thinking about.
