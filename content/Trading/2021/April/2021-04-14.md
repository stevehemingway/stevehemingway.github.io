I am slightly amazed that the death of a ninety-nine year old man, who was never in line to the throne, should cause such widespread shutting down of civic activity.
I have never understood the reverence with which the royal family is held, although I willingly concede that our system is, perhaps surprisingly, better than the alternative of having an elected head of state. 
Certainly, the idea of having a head of state with huge, and growing executive powers, such as the system found in the USA, is a recipe for bad governance.

## Worth following

I heard an interview with the CIO of [Massif Capital](https://www.massifcap.com/) on The Market Huddle. He had some very interesting things to say about carbon credits, European ESG, gold, lithium, uranium.
I urge you to listen to [the episode](https://markethuddle.com/).

## Wrap

Markets lack direction.
The 10Y yield was up a tiny bit, equity markets had a wide diffusion.
