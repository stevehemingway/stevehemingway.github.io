## Whitecap Resources: a Canadian carbon-capture play

[This article](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4435982-whitecap-resources-id-like-a-little-oil-with-my-carbon-capture-please) makes the bull case for $WCP:TOR
It's an oil company that's carbon negative, because it can store CO~2~ in so-called carbon-capture underground storage (CCUS). 
I'm not sold on CCUS, but I think all these schemes to reduce CO~2~ emissions are wildly expensive. 
For $WCP, it doesn't matter, presumably, because the income will come from taxpayers (or, the public, via wheezes like the "fossil fuel obligation").
I have solar panels: they are a crazy way of generating electricity, but as long as I get my feed-in tariff, I'm happy.

## Expectations and inflation 

Jeremy Rudd doesn't think that expectations matter, at least for determining the path of inflation.
[His paper for Jackson Hole](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2021062pap.pdf) causes quite a stir when it came out, more for the footnotes than the content, possibly.
But expectations matter a whole lot for equity prices. In particular analysts' expectations of income numbers, heavily adjusted and massaged although they nearly always are.
The problem is that they've been been way out of line recently. I always thought that these estimates were not really estimates but numbers whispered to the (favoured) analysts by CEOs and CFOs a short time before the print, just to make sure that vested shares could be sold into a rally. Maybe I overestimated the CEOs (or underestimated the analysts), because this big overshoot has been dramatic this time. 

I got this from [The Market Ear](https://themarketear.com/). I can't give a link to the post, because you have to sign up for the free newsletter.

> Data Trek asks the highly relevant question; how good Q3 US corporate earnings season have to be to get a large cap stock rally into the end of 2021? Data Trek answer: "In a typical quarter, companies beat Wall Street’s earnings estimates by 3-4 percent. In Q1 and Q2 2021, however, the beats were much higher: 23 and 17 percentage points above analysts’ estimates, respectively. It is that extraordinary level of operational outperformance that has given us a 17 percent YTD return on the S&P 500. Our answer: the companies of the S&P 500 need to beat by an aggregate 10 percentage points this quarter, or we’ve almost certainly seen the highs on US equity markets for the year". |
