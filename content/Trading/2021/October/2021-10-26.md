## Physical copper at the LME

[This article by Doomberg](https://doomberg.substack.com/p/doctor-copper-is-sick?r=nmbt&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=) suggests that the copper futures price does not reflect the shortage of the cash physical copper which the market is a derivative of.
I've seen a lot of suggestions that the gold futures price is manipulated, to keep the 'official' price down, the same being said for silver.
I don't know if this is correct, but the world economy is rebounding strongly, clearly, so it's surprising that copper has not joined in the party.
