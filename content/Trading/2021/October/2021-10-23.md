![The CBOT Interest Rate Vol Index](https://www.tradingview.com/x/G1eyFHen/) is climbing again, as the VIX is crushed.
Eurodollar futures have been moving down steadily. 
Admittedly, this index gave some false signals in March, spiking to 86 and then falling, but if it continues to rise, it will be ... interesting.

No, not $ESPN! 
This is Epsilon Energy. 
Strong cashflow, no debt, oil and gas.
Microcap, but might be worth a look.


## Import-csv <csv file> | out-gridview 

I just discovered this. A powershell built-in command (well, two, I guess). It allows a gui-view of the CSV file, with he sort of sorting and filtering one would get in Excel. No export of subsets, but very handy _and a built-in utility_.
