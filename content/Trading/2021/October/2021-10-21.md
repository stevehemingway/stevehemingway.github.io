## The frustrations of trading

Money is made by anticipating future events before other market participants. 
This is not easy: the consensus is usually fairly accurate.

## Stock of the day: Destination XL Group ($DXLG)

This was recommended by [The Alpha Letter](https://www.alphaletter.co/p/invest-in-stocks-like-nancy-pelosi-ded).
Neither the author nor I are financial advisers, so do your own research.
It's a tiny stock, so it's easily manipulated. It has just come out of bankruptcy, so it's definitely not for the faint-hearted.
It's bricks and mortar retail, which makes it even less attractive, but at some point it's a "cigar butt with a few good puffs left in it."
I haven't even looked at the cashflow. 
I note it here more as a reminder to myself to revisit it than in any sense a recommendation.
