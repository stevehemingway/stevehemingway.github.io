## Stock of the day: Jubilee Metals Group ($JUB:TSE)

Used to be Jubilee Platinium, mines all sorts of minerals. 
Small cap (~CAD 500MM), strong cash flow, rapid recent growth in earnings, P/E still < 12, low debt, no large exceptional items.
Based in London, traded on the TSX Venture exchange in Toronto and Montreal (this is a purely electronic exchange).
This is worth a look, as it is below the radar of the big funds and cannot be traded in large size.
