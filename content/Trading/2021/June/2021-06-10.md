## Who will hold the executive to account? (Part 94)

[How to challenge your local council's accounts.](https://researchforaction.uk/how-to-challenge-your-councils-financial-accounts)

According to Private Eye, this power has been hardly ever used. 
My feeling is that scrutiny of local councils is woefully inadequate.
I don't know if the current system is workable. 
It requires uniformed volunteers to take on well-funded incumbents who are paid public money to bat away difficult questions.

A free press is a buttress against tyranny, for sure. But in the age of social media, the mainstream media seems an irrelevance. 
The Guardian seems to be hemorrhaging cash, and seems a very unhappy ship indeed, with a lot of very unhappy and underpaid journalists.
[Inevitably, the Daily Mail indulges in an orgy of _schadenfreude_](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9669115/Guardian-chief-executive-Annette-Thomas-quits-just-15-months-job-600-000-payoff.html) but you can see why they would gloat.


## Wrap

Well, the CPI came in at 5%, but absolutely nobody blinked. 
DX flat, oil flat (well, up 30bp), equities (SPX) up 44bp (which practically counts as flat), bonds up, 10Y yield now at 1.46%.

The market met the highest inflation print for 13 years with a huge yawn. Jobless claims down to 376K, half the level of April 2020, was shrugged off.
Alex Manzara saw this coming: [Alex Manzara reckons that whatever the CPI print is, it won't matter.](https://www.chartpoint.com/cpi-already-in-the-rearview-mirror/)
I think that until the asset bubble bursts, we will not see inflation.
People are ploughing every last bean of their spare cash into bitcoin, property, classic cars, wine [and even insanely expensive stamps](https://newseu.cgtn.com/news/2021-06-10/This-1-cent-Magenta-stamp-is-now-worth-8-3m-10Z0XncGafC/index.html).
At some point, someone will blink, or we'll go fully Japanification of the US economy.

JUNE CPI: First, it is ridiculed. \

AUG CPI: Third, it is accepted as being self-evident".](https://twitter.com/ag_trader/status/1402911566475915267?s=20)
