title: Two little hikes, by the end of 2023, and it's done

## Wrap

Finally, things started moving.
The Fed signalled that it is going to start hiking. 
And, implicitly (one assumes), tapering.
This cause spike in the dollar index, DX, up by 1%.
All commodities fell, in sympathy, with the exception of NG.
Equities dropped by ~0.7% (SPX & ACWI).
Bonds, though, didn't think this would be enough: the 10Y yield went back up to 1.57, up 7bp.

Overall, a tiny bit of excitement on a hot summer evening. 
European indexes were up, but I think the markets may have closed by the time of the rate hike intentions had been released.

In other economic news, housing starts were strong: 3.6% MoM. I think that the disaster that was housing in the US in 2009 may finally be healing.
$EQR might be a way of playing this.

## Crumbs
CBOE will extend VIX & SPX options trading to virtually 24 hrs from 21 Nov this year.
