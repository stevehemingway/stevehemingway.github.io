title: This time it's different. At least for miners.

## Wrap for 29 June 2021

Oh what a dull day. No particular news. Probably biggest move was DX up 20bp. No big deal, but it seems to have dragged energy commodities down.  NZD was down 0.7%, so quite a big move, but it's not a deep market.
Equities and bonds both desperately flat. 
BTC up 5.6%, so practically flat.

## Crumbs from the interweb

Steel is the new lumber

Hot rolled coils futures off the chart.

Lots of chatter about $100 oil.

EV stocks are very strong, still. Tesla, Nio, Nikola, Workhorse. 

Fed needs to do more tapering than the ECB, so this is bullish for the USD.

[Miners may be able to exercise more restraint in cranking up capital expenditure this commodity cycle.](https://www.economist.com/business/2021/06/26/big-miners-capital-discipline-is-good-news-for-investors) The combination of this and the defunding of energy exploration companies might actually be very good for investors in miners.

[Florida building collapse linked to corruption.](https://en.mercopress.com/2021/06/29/history-of-corruption-and-bribes-behind-doomed-florida-building-reported) As usual, building standards do not make a difference without a transparent process of bidding and incorruptible inspectors.

[Day-One Advice for New Hedge Fund Portfolio Managers.](https://www.epsilontheory.com/day-one-advice-for-new-hedge-fund-portfolio-managers/)
This is from Brent Donnelly, author of [Alpha Trader](https://www.amazon.com/Alpha-Trader-Methodology-Mathematics-Professional/dp/1736739816/).
My takeaways from the summary are:

- your real stop loss is less than your notional one. Understand what you really stand to lose.
- trade cautiously, especially at first. 
- understand that being up by 1% followed by being down by 1% will, cumulatively, wipe you out,
- don't be too proud to do a stupid trade. As long as it makes money, it doesn't matter if its stupid.
- don't decide that the markets where you have an edge are too dull and that you'll start punting in markets you've never traded before,
- keep your powder dry. If you get allocated more capital, don't just use it up on day one.
- always remember that the global macro cycle is the most important driver in nearly all markets,
- don't be afraid to run against the crowd (especially when you're a PM in a shop where everyone is on the other side of the trade).
