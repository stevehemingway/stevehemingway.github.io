## Oil

Democratic governments have decided that their re-electability is being threatened by rising energy prices, so they have released reserves of oil in a coordinated move to beat down the price.
The problem is that with the world consuming approx 100 million barrels of oil a day, these reserves are really not that big a deal.
After last week, oil is moving up again, which is bad for inflation and for the optics of government actions.

## Wrap

All non-monetary commodities (more or less) were up, following the jump in oil prices.
Some commodity-dominated markets were up (Brazil, Toronto) but most were down or flat.
Bonds were pretty much flat.

## Boris

Boris gave a speech to the CBI which was badly received.
I have no idea why he was giving a speech to them: we are not in an election campaign, and there are plenty of policy problems to sort out.
The FT was pretty scathing, but even The Sun, which is generally supportive, was not happy.
Politicians make policy errors all the time, but normally the media give them the benefit of the doubt.
Once the pendulum starts to change direction, it's hard to get them onside.
The media seem to believe that Johnson doesn't have the stomach for a protracted battle, and might step down, which surely will be a disaster, electorally, for the Conservatives.
