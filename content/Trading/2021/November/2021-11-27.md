## Camping World

Camping World Holdings is the leading supplier of recreational vehicles in the USA.
It is highly geared and has some questionable management.
It has a very low profit margin, because it has "a very high asset turnover."
A big component of the debt is related to its leasing business, something more commonly associated with vehicle manufacturers, not retailers.

The company has a very large short interest, which indicates that a lot of people are dubious, to say the least, about this company. I know that Mark Cohodes is a bull. I really don't know what this company is worth, but there is a possibility that this company is about to enter a period of strong growth, particularly if people continue to be nervous about socializing because pandemics continue to beseige the world.
