## Borg Warner

Borg Warner used to have a plant in Caerphilly, S. Wales, close to where I grew up.
I think the company probably advertised a bit around the area, and I think that one of my early schoolfriends had a father who worked there.
It's a company that people don't think about much. 
It makes bits for cars that are purchased by car manufacturers you have heard of.
I think the plant in Caerphilly made auto transmissions: gearboxes, I suppose.
Thus items which are boring but important, and which smart cookies in Silicon Valley are content to say well clear of.
The company is trading on a P/E of 11.6, and has had a pretty solid growt in profits over the last five years of approx 25%.
I bought Delphi Technologies, the former parts division of GM.
This is so "old economy:" a company that has physical inventory, and makes steadily growing profits.

Well, it's price hasn't moved much, but it is generating loads of cash, and is a big player in a small market.
It does make stuff for EVs too as [this](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4473812-borgwarner-an-excellent-play-on-the-future-of-electric-vehicles?utm_campaign=RTA+Articles&utm_medium=email&utm_source=seeking_alpha&utm_term=RTA+Article+Smart) article makes clear. 

The recent revenue (trailing twelve months) has been 50% up on last year, suggesting that when the Q3 figures are announced, this stock might get a re-rating.
The company has beaten estimates reliably, and it might be that the next beat will trigger a re-rating.
I don't suppose that it will ever become another Tesla, but it certainly could justify a P/E of 20, I feel.
As usual, this is not investment advice. DYOR.
