title:  Markets bounce back

# Monday  6, December 2021

## Wrap

Markets retraced today. Risk assets bounced, bonds sagged (a little bit).
Crypto stopped falling.
No obvious course. 
Pundits claim it's the 'realization' that Omicron is not very virulent, but we knew that as soon as it was announced.
I guess it's the bull reasserting itself.
$ARKK:NSQ seems to have recovered some of its recent losses, buoyed up by the frothy markets. 
I am not convinced it'll stay up. 
As a very high-beta stock, wild swings are to be expected.


## News


HC-One, a care home provider in the UK was given £18.9 MM in pandemic support last year, while paying out £4.8 MM to financial investors.
I think the UK govt. mishandling of procurement and corporate support in the peak of the pandemic will eventually bring it down.
The procurement scandal will go on and on.
