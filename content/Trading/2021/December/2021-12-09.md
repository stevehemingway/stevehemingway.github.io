## Charity giving

A recent Econtalk podcast was with a founder of [Give Directly](https://www.givedirectly.org/).
The idea of this is beautifully simple: money you give to the charity ends up directly in the hands of a very poor person.
There are no NGOs involved. 
No goverment officials are involved.
No millenium development goals are measured.
The charity does not to bear the cost of a ridiculously overvalued official exchange rate.
No tariffs or bribes need to be paid to deploy the funds.
No presidential family members get contracts to build over-priced infrastructure.
It's just money paid via one of the several African digital wallets.

Simples!

## Wrap

Risk assets reversed some of their moves over the last three days.
There seems to be no obvious trigger.
Some meme stocks hammered. Tesla puked: down over 6%, but will probably bounce back.
Bitcoin is back where it was in February. I doubt if many retail traders have made money this year.
