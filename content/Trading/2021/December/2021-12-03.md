## Docusign ($DOCU:NSQ)

Docusign "puked" today.
It was down 32% pre-market.
Dr Patel joked about it:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Docusign stock price down 30% after analysts discover that the entire business can be replaced by pen and paper</p>&mdash; Dr. Parik Patel, BA, CFA, ACCA Esq. ðŸ’¸ (@ParikPatelCFA) <a href="https://twitter.com/ParikPatelCFA/status/1466545964353671168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

but the reason the stock went down was that the results confirmed what everyone knew: that lockdown stocks are usually chronically lossmaking.
The publishing of the figures was the trigger, but we all knew this was not a great business.
Nobody wants to go first, but there is safety in numbers.
Exactly how the crowd follows is difficult to model, but it's definitely not entirely down to the underlying economics.
