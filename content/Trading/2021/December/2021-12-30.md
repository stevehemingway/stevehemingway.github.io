## The future is already here, it's just not very evenly distributed

New England is a lodestar. It shows ordinary people like me where the world is going.
It is achingly hip, and green, and averse to fossil fuels and nuclear power.
It doesn't like gas pipelines and will stop ones being built in its own states.
It wants to transition to a fossil-fuel-free electricity grid.

The world is going in this direction, and maybe it's a good thing.
But it will not be as painless a transition as the think tankers tell you.
In New England, it's going to get very cold for a lot of people this winter, unless we get an incredibly mild winter, and at some point ordinary consumers are likely to revolt.

I didn't do the work to prove this, but Doomberg did. I strongly urge you to read his excellent take on the situation, [here](https://doomberg.substack.com/p/new-england-is-an-energy-crisis-waiting?r=nmbt&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=email).
