## Worth Reading

- [Why Biden is so disappointing to progressive democrats](https://stephensemler.substack.com/p/biden-over-delivered-on-military?r=nmbt&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=email). 
Biden will outspend Trump on the military industrial complex, but will massively underspend on promised social programmes.

- [BGS is worth a look, like other processed food brands](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4476924-b-and-g-foods-speculative-dividend-play?messageid=2800&utm_campaign=4476924&utm_medium=email&utm_source=seeking_alpha&utm_term=RTA+Article+Smart). 
BGS has the added benefit of being highly geared and heavily shorted. Obviously, not one to buy on the way into a recession.

- [Big Pharma sold vaccines on a false promise?](https://dossier.substack.com/p/covid-shots-were-both-marketed-by?r=nmbt&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=email). 
Sounds a bit like a conspiracy theory, but it's kind of weird that vaccines have been so unsuccessful in preventing transmission.

- [$OXY looking like a value proposition.](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4477028-pay-attention-to-occidental-petroleum-paying-back-debt?messageid=2800&utm_campaign=4477028&utm_medium=email&utm_source=seeking_alpha&utm_term=RTA+Article+Smart)
I am very bullish about oil, but the actual commodity has just gone sideways. 
There is a lot to be said for buying a drilling company that will give positive carry while we wait for the market to realize that the commodity is going to the moon.
