## FOMC meeting today

Commentators usually avoid making predictions.
Markets have an uncanny ability to make fools of all of us, 
arguably, the smartest are the ones with most to lose.

Anyway, Alex Manzara, who I respect hugely, has just come out and made a clear and timely prediction about the trickies market of all: US Treasuries (well, the whol USD risk-free yield curve, really).

> FOMC today.  Heres what I think is going to happen.  At 2pm when the announcement and SEP are released, there will be a knee-jerk reaction lower in near and red ED contracts because the dots are going higher as are the inflation projections, even IF the taper is accelerated.  However, at the 2:30 presser Powell will temper the hawkishness and by the end of the day the curve will be steeper, long rates will be higher, short end rates will be lower, and front end vol will be much lower. 

For my two-pennyworth, it seems obvious that the Fed doesn't want to let the curve invert, and so will not do anything to depress long-end rates
any more than they are are already depressed.
Banks (traditionally) make money by funding at the short end and lending at the long end, so will be pressing Powell to do something about the recent flattening we've seen.

There are many players in this market, but keeping the short end pinned to the floor will suit most of them.
As Manzara points out, the Fed cannot continue to be the marginal buyer for ever, and if that is not to crash the equity market there will have to be ultra-cheap repo rates to encourage private buyers to take on the role of buying these bonds. It's looking as though China wants to pass on the baton.


The great thing about this prediction, is that we'll know if he was right this time tomorrow.
