# The day in review

## Isaac Newton a victim of 'Cancel Culture' 

[Yes, you read that right.](https://atlantico.fr/article/decryptage/si-isaac-newton-peut-etre-annule-personne-n-est-en-securite-cancel-culture-frank-furedi) The headline reads "If Isaac Newton may be cancelled, nobody is safe from it." 
That someone who has had such insights of universal application should be a candidate for suppression makes me very depressed. 

## Bubbliest bubble in bubble history

[Yes, we're in it.](https://thefelderreport.com/2021/05/05/take-a-bow-jay-pow/)

## Wrap

Fairly flat day, except that European equity markets seem to be catching up with US ones.
Commodities fairly mixed, food and gold doing best.
Bonds slightly deflationary: 10Y yield now at 1.57%.
Tech monopoly shares ($APPL etc.) looking fairly tired.
Some coal stocks doing very well: $HNRG is now up 250% over the year, 13% for the day. This indicates that King Coal has not yet handed in his orb and sceptre. 

## Notes

I'll be busy tomorrow and probably won't be able to write post. 
Apologies for truncated entry today.
