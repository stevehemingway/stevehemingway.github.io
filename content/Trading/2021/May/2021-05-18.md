title: Housing starts disappoint
date: 18 May 2021

# The close of the day

## Wrap

Odd day. Housing starts disappointing, although recent data has been very noisy. Explanations vary from shortage of labour to shortage of lumber. Weather is always a confounding factor.
Not obviously risk on or risk off:

- Ponzi sector up, $ARKK up 1.43%,
- $DXY weaker, 89.7, down 0.4%,
- broad US indices all down, even NDX,
- most vol indexes up, VIX futures up 1.4, i.e. 7% (caveat: percent of a percent),
- gold up, modestly,
- commodities mixed, crude down 1.3%,
- most bonds fairly flat, 10Y flat at 1.64%,

No obvious direction. My view is that housing starts will be seen as an outlier, down to specific problems affecting the housebuilding industry, with general economic activity continuing to grow strongly, creating a headwind for the dollar and yields.
