title: Another flat day in the markets
date: 25 March 2021

## Note

I am not spending much time on this blog this week and next. I have personal stuff to deal with.

## Wrap

The markets seem to be directionless. Gold is up a bit, Comex futures near month now over 1900.
Bonds are up: 10Y yield down to 1.581%.
Oil is practically flat, CRB is up 1%.
Equities are practically flat: NDX up 0.1%, SPX down 0.2%.
The dollar is weakening, back to 90. General flows seem to suggest this is a conviction trade.

## Other news

There doesn't seem to be much news.
There is a lot of coverage of crypto, but I suspect that this is because of a lack of major international, financial or political news.
A lot of commentators are focussed obsessively on the Fed. 
It seems to be using the reverse repo facility, heavily, to shift all those T-Bonds that it keeps accumulating back onto the banks balance sheets. 
How buying up a huge chunk of the market (after the primary dealers have taken their vig) only to loan it back to the banks again seems an worse than pointless activity.
