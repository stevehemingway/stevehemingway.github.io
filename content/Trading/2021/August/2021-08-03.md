## Oil becalmed

Open interest in oil futures is dropping rapidly. 
Basically, all markets, from gold to oil to USTs are settling on an disinflationary  thesis.

I can't help thinking that this will spill over in emerging markets debt, i.e. that we'll soon see the end of 7% yields in Brazil, but it hasn't happened yet.
South Africa seems a basket case. It's hard to imagine that it's bond market and currency can both survive in tact for much longer.
