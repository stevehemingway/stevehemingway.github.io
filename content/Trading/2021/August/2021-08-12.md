## CPI read

US inflation (CPI measure) was 5.4% annualized in July, a rate unchanged from the previous month and fractionally above expectations.

Crude stocks were marginally less down than expected.

The Senate passed a $1T (i.e. $1MMM) infrastructure bill, with cross party support. 
A federal budget framework of $3.5T was also agreed by the Senate (very narrowly, 50-49).

A deficit of $302MMM was notched up in July. At that rate, that's a deficit of $3.6T: a lot of money.
A trillion here, a trillion there, and pretty soon we're talking real money.
Stocks went up, more all time highs.
The dollar dropped to 93 (DXY), but it's still very high.
Treasuries were unbothered.
Nothing matters, until everything matters. 
The sentiment of the market is that everything will turn out OK.
Maybe that's correct.
The market is probably an unbiased indicator.
