## Apple announces image scanning by iPhones

iPhones in the USA will scan your images to check if you are engaged in child sexual exploitation.
Well, that's the official reason. 
Once the population have accepted this, well, you've agreed to share your data with the NSA. 

No doubt a few mainstream media outlets will witter on about 'privacy concerns' but when they see that nobody cares any longer they'll drop the topic. 
Of course, some people will just shrug, as the Russians do when they discover that Vlad Putin has just been elected again with 99% of the vote.
