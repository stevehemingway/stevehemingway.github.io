## Markets

I haven't posted daily recently.
I'm too busy with RL.
But the trend seems embedded: commodities down, dollar up, yields down, curves flattening, inflation transitory, rates heading to zero (real rates -2%). Equity markets lack direction.
The accepted cause seems to be the dreaded Delta Variant.
Australia and China have had waves of the variant, and so everyone now doubts whether the world will ever get back to 'normal'.
I feel that we are near the end of the tunnel.
Estimates for deaths from Covid seem to be between 4 million and 8 million. 
This is a lot, but it's still only about one in a thousand, and overwhelmingly it kills those who are already very ill or very old.
I would not dream of saying that authorities over reacted. 
The level of the threat was sufficient to justify a lot of the actions taken.
But now we understand a lot about the disease and most people can take effective steps to avoid catching it, if they wish to.

Earnings coming up:

- NDQ:CURI (CuriosityStream),
- NYSE:OPFI (OppFi),
- NDQ:PAYO (Payoneer),
- NDQ:ROOT (Root Insurance),

Of these, OppFi looks to be on a flightpath to oblivion, from a technical perspective.
The others look too perky to short, in my opinion. 
_Not investment advice!_
