# Crumbs

- [Miller Value Partners Deep Value Strategies](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4403901-miller-value-partners-deep-value-strategies-q4-2020-letter) include Brighthouse Financial ($BHF), Wells Fargo ($WFC) and Gannett ($GCI). I don't know much about the last, but the first two are financial sector stocks that have had a rough time lately. They seem to be trading below book value.
- Fairholme Fund: big positions: $JOE, $FLHM, $FNMA, Imperial Metals Corp. 
- Bonsai Partners -- big positions: Redbubble, Micron Tech, PushPay, Travelsky Tech, LKQ, Taiwan Semi, Illumina. Illumina does genome sequencing etc. It is very solvent, but at a P/E of nearly 80 on a forward basis, it's very expensive. 
- Yacktman Asset Management: Tyson Foods ($TSN), Pepsi-co ($PEP), Ingredion ($INGR). Consumer staples focussed.
- [Insiders are very bearish](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/insider-selling-is-alarmingly-high-and-small-cap-stocks-are-in-the-crosshairs-11611624945),
- [Retail REITs may have hit a bottom](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4403755-game-stopped-for-shorted-reits),
- [Kuppy's Event-Driven Monitor this week](https://kedm.com/) is touting: $USDP, $REP SM, $LGND, $ARQT, $LRN, $WBA, $CVV, $FGPRQ (yes, bankrupt) and various SPAC warrant arbitrages. Perfect for those of you who like living dangerously! FGPRQ has a m. cap of $75MM, so qualifies as a nanocap. $WBA is Walgreens Boots Alliance: you'd think it had value in a pandemic.

- Alex Manzara always comes up with an interesting weekend post. [Last week's](https://www.chartpoint.com/cross-of-inflation/) was no different. His comments range from a look at the underperformance of commodities relative to stocks over 30 years, and the meaning of the famous "Cross of gold" speech, by William Jennings Bryan in 1896. In fact -- and I hadn't understood this -- it was a cry for looser monetary conditions. It's amazing to think how little has changed in well over a century.
- VIX continues to crash.

# Wrap

Massive risk-on day. Supposedly explained by the fact that the stimulus bill in the USA is going to be passed, but really just because of a burst of FOMO:

- European bond yields generally up, except Italy, US 30-year is now yielding more than 2%,
- almost all commodities up, except a couple of lightly traded foodstuffs (cocoa, coffee, milk & sugar!!), nickel at a six-year high,
- nearly all US and European equity markets up,
- most currencies flat, although AUD was up 0.38% vs USD, presumably because of the strength of commodities,
- Bitcoin has gone ballistic, as Elon Musk says that Tesla has purchased $1.5B worth of it (more than it spends in a year on R&D!).
