- [Industrial capacity utilization is up, but still on a downward trend](https://thesoundingline.com/us-capacity-utilization-back-to-2016-levels/). This will depress inflation expectations.

# Wrap

Inflation seems to be rearing its ugly head. That's very bad for markets (i.e. long investors), it seems.

- 10Y Treasuries up to 1.49% yield,
- QQQ down 3.4%,
- SPX down 2.3%,
- $TSLA down 7.6%,
- Crude up 0.35%, but most others down (except Live cows and lean hogs),
- DXY up a fraction (90.225),
