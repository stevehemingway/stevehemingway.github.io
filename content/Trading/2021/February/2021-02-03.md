# Crumbs

- [Alex M thinks that the steepener is still on](https://www.chartpoint.com/long-end-weakness-persists/). He also makes some oblique reference about the link between Treasury vol and the credit element of LIBOR (which is disappearing, to be replace by SOFR). This is important for people involved in options on Eurodollar futures, which sounds a niche area, but is actually an absolutely _huge_ market.

TL;DR: inflation, PBoC (China's central bank) acting to take the punchbowl away (unlike the Fed!), redistribution (from those that have yachts, to those that have not), reversal of heavy flows from retail, especially into EM debt, ![3a41b4041ab76cabbe8f93d2c95898d6.png]({attach}3a41b4041ab76cabbe8f93d2c95898d6.png)

# Worth a look, maybe

I joined the [Walter Bloomberg](https://twitter.com/DeItaOne) and [Unusual Whales](https://twitter.com/unusual_stocks) Discord channels. 
I've followed Walter on Twitter for a while.
I don't know about UW, but they seem to pick out stocks with very large Z movements (e.g. 10 standard deviation moves).

# Thought

We delude ourselves if we believe that we consume a representative stream of news. 
People produce content for us to consume so that they can get paid.
We are the last link in the value chain: one way or other we will pay.
When we watched ITV, we paid in a very subtle way: we allowed our behaviour to be manipulated by advertising so that manufacturers could get extra profits from the things they sold via advertising.
Of course, most people just thought "I will sit through these adverts, they are vaguely amusing, and may persuade other people to make sub-optimal (more expensive) buying decision, but I would never do that." Of course, they were collectively wrong, otherwise advertisers would have determined that ad spend was being wasted on TV.
Of course, the BBC was paid for by a sort of poll tax. 
In both cases, the best interests of those that controlled the money was to make content as bland and as middle of the road as possible, and produce opinion which was least likely to alienate viewers.
The same dynamic was at work in newspapers, which of course existed to sell advertising too.

Now things are very different. Engagement, from which follows advertising revenue, is a "corner solution." 
Polarizing takes work.
Trump is the result, but he will not be the last chapter in the story.
This was all foreshadowed by [The Glasgow Media Group](https://www.glasgowmediagroup.org/about-us/books) and (I now realize, although I haven't read it) Chomsky's "Manufactured Consent."
Misleading news does not have be "fake" in Trumps terms. It is enough that events are reported selectively.
And we all face incentives, whether financial or social. 

These ideas were stimulated by listening to [Capital Isn't](https://capitalisnt.com/episodes/manufacturing-dissent-with-matt-taibbi). I am a huge fan of Taibbi and Zingales. 
This is the first episode of the podcast I've listened to. It was good.
