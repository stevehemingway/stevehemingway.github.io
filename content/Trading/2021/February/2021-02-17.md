# Crumbs

[The new Bear Cave newsletter (#53) is out](https://thebearcave.substack.com/p/the-bear-cave-53). It has picked up that the ARK ETF(s) may implode.

Other bearish tickers: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ Why are there so many SPACs?<br><br>Answer 1: Great economics for sponsor (average of 20% of money raised upon deSPAC / merging with a target, Eg $400M SPAC = $80M). Itâ€™s like a separate carried interest pool for each company and liquid since already public!</p>&mdash; Alex Rampell (@arampell) <a href="https://twitter.com/arampell/status/1361024994483011586?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 14, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

[The Spruce Point Newsletter](https://madmimi.com/p/8577f11?pact=963196-162055758-13184480810-ebc1847188521e3921550a3e9e853407c36b9286) defends short sellers in general, and comments that:

- Leidos ($LDOS) is badly managed, possibly fraudulent, and (therefore) overvalued.

- [Wolfpack Research is bearish on Remark Holdings ($MARK)](https://wolfpackresearch.com/research/wolfpack-is-short-remark-holdings/). Not sure why (video link). Quite interesting chart:

- [How long will students pay for housing they cannot occupy?](https://www.ft.com/content/842b8cf2-7a12-455e-8e22-1d4a04acffe4). Bearish for LSE:UTG.

# Wrap

Globally pretty risk off. 

- most global equity indexes down, apart from the antiquated Dow Jones Industrial Average, which squeezed out another 0.34% to reach yet another all-time high,
- fairly quiet on the foreign exchange desks, except the Brazilian Real (BRL) was down 0.74% and the Swiss Franc something similar!
- yields up everywhere, even Germany. This is risk on, but the moves are not large,
- energy commodities generally up, precious metals down, except platinum, probably, which has been going parabolic lately,
- FAANG gang mostly up. Apple down 1.85%

Generally, a slow news day. FOMC meeting a damp squib (no change in policy foreseen), industrial output, and prices, both rising strongly. Producer prices went up 1.3% in January: if this keeps going, the Fed will end up tightening before the year is out. 

# Comment

Prince Philip, the DoE, was admitted to hospital. 
The institution of the monarchy in Britain is a bizarre overhang of something that once was politically important.
The UK establishment, especially the upper classes, has a great talent for absorbing all sorts in order to profit from them.
This was rather elegantly explained in [Bagehot's recent column in the Economist Magazine](https://www.economist.com/britain/2021/02/13/the-british-establishment-is-the-worlds-most-open-for-a-price).
