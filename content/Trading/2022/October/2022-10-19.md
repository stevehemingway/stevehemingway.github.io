## Kuppy on the UK
@Kuppy bangs on about 'Project Zimbabwe:' the plan to turn the USA into an emerging market by debasing its currency (and generally undermining the institutions which support capitalism there). 
[He writes about](https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2022/10/16/are-dms-now-ems/) the UK, and how a few mis-steps by our glorious PM has destabilized the gilts market.
Truss now has gone into a padded cell and the government is being run by a technocrat who will make sure the market gods are appeased, but we sure had a wobbly few days.
