## The market as I see it

## Wrap

Central banks are going to take that bloody punchbowl away again.
The Fed is expected to hike 75bp, and the BoE the same.
Headline inflation is high, but falling surely. The RBA (tomrrow) is expected to hike just 25bp, so maybe this is the start of the end.

Fixed income yields were up across the curve, but with a slightly flattening tilt.
At settlement, 2s +8.1bps at 4.503%, 3s +7.4bps at 4.463%, 5s +7.4bps at 4.262%, 7s +7.2bps at 4.177%, 10s +7.5bps at 4.085%, 20s +5.5bps at 4.444%, 30s +6.7bps at 4.196%. (data from Newsquawk).

Oil was down $1.37 a barrel on the expectation of further Chinese weakness and a stronger dollar.

Equities were down in the US, but up in Europe, presumably again influenced by the dollar. DXY went as high as 111.67 before sagging a bit.

FX was mainly about the dollar, but the Yen was particularly weak.
