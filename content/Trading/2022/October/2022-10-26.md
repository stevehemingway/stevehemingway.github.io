## 5-30 Steepener
Lending money to someone for thirty years is a lot riskier than lending to them for one year, or even for five years.
The market's price of risk is an interest rate premium. Lending to me is a lot riskier than lending to HM Treasury, so I pay a higher rate of interest. 
You would have thought that even with the US Treasury lenders would demand a higher rate to lend for 30 years than for five, but in fact that is not always the case, as the chart shows.
When lending long-term, the biggest risk for the lender is inflation, which will kill real returns.
With inflation at 10%, a yield of 4.5% means that every year one's asset is wasting away by 5.5%.
In fact, since April 2021 the premium has evaporated to the point that today it's zero. 
In recent years, this spread has almost never got lower than -60bp. 
With inflation getting entrenched, it seems logical that the 30-year rate will start to outpace the 5-year one, but these are odd times, and if the Fed starts buying long-dated Treasuries again, all bets are off.
