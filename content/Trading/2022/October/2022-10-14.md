title: A grim day for Miss Truss 
date: 2022-10-14

## Wrap
The fallout from yesterday's CPI print is still being felt.
The money supply is the only thing that matters, and the Fed is the only central bank that matters.
After a 160 point move in SPX yesterday, there was a 100 point move in the other direction today.
This gave a bearish tint to all risk assets and (predictably) dragged down energy commodities.
Basically every traded commodity was down, as were large commodity stocks ($XOM down 2.65%).
Of course, most commodity-oriented emerging market equity indexes were down too, e.g. Bovespa   down 1%. Bitcoin was down 1%, but seems to be holding up remarkably well at ~$19K. Ethereum was up, but having falled from ~$4.8K to ~$1.3K in the course of the last year.

## Note

I am still not returned to normal after my holiday.
It makes you want to skip holidays altogether: my father's solution to this problem.
