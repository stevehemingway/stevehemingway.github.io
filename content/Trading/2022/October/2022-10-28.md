## Twitter
Elon Musk didn't pull out. He now has a new baby, Twitter, which is de-listed and privately held.
I love the service, and I am utterly dismayed by the idea of it being controlled by a criminal mastermind, but I guess there are synergies in being a stockprice manipulator and owning the stockprice manipulation machine.
I had better not express opinions like that on Twitter again though, as it's only my lack of followers that has allowed my views to be relatively uncensored in the past.
(I was suspended for quite a while, but somehow I served my time and was released from Twitter jail. I still have no idea what the offending tweet was.)
