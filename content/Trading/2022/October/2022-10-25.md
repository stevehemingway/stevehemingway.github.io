## Rishi Sunak, come on down!
Today, or maybe yesterday, Rishi Sunak became the latest UK PM.
He's incredibly smart, thin, brown, rich and short.
He has not been battle-hardened in the ways of Westminster, and plenty on his own side, not to mention the other, would be delighted to see him fail. 
He is probably not terribly well known to the British public. 
I cannot see most of them warming very rapidly to a billionaire Wykhamist hedge-fund boss who has spent most of his professional life on the west coast of the USA.
He has recently spent Â£100K on a swimming pool, allegedly.
I don't begrudge him the right to spend time with his money, but stories of his wealth will dog him wherever he goes, generating resentment amongst even his supporters. 
How he deals with this will be a serious test of his electability. 
As a politician, one is not allowed to have perfectly normal and justifiable reactions to people being mean to one. 

Anyway, we will see how he copes with his new role. 

## Wrap

I'll do this for the week. Generally, things have been risk off:

- bond yields are generally down, in developed markets,
- in spite of the miserable news about Xi appointing himself dictator for life, and surrounding him with cronies, commodities are generally up, if only a teeny bit,
- practically all developed stock markets in N. America and Europe are up, by a couple of percent on the week,
- the dollar has been struggling to make headway. I am sure this has been the main impetus for stocks and commodities,
- crypto is also up. It's like stocks, but with a beta of ~2, so this is to be expected.
The big stories, as far as I can see were:
- the UK has a new PM, who is a finance guy, so gilts are strong, for the moment,
- the Dems will probably lose the HoR, but no more heavily than was expected months ago,
- Biden is selling the SPR furiously, to bring down the price of gasoline, to improve the Dem's election prospects. Weak demand for China is helping him achieve this,
