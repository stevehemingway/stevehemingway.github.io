Yields were repressed in the 50s, to pay for WWII. 
They skyrocketed in the 70s/80s before the very harsh medicine of Paul Volker was used to bring yields down control.
Budget deficits are huge now, compared to then, as a proportion of GDP. 
With many countries having debt to GDP in excess of 100%, it's hard to see how any politician can tolerate another Volker at the Fed, and doubly so in countries like the UK. 
My guess is that we get a Havenstein Moment, and yields go to infinity.
