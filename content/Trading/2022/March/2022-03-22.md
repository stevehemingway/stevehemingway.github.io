## Wrap

Oil is now at $111 a barrel, and nobody knows where it's going.
Clearly, the high prices will drive more production, and a lot of oil can be produced at less than $100.
However, Russia is 10% of global supply, and it's not clear that OPEC will fill the gap, at least in the short term.

Inflation is still a red-hot topic. 
Powell has said he will keep hiking, and with inflation unlikely to respond, it's hard to see how this will play out.
I can't see him crashing the markets, but the 10Y yield is now at 2.13%, with a lot of curves inverted.
The smart money is on a recession, sadly.

Energy Aspects (via Zerohedge) alleges that China is hoovering up cheap Russian oil.

China's manipulated stock market is hard to analyze using conventional approaches:

Not everyone buys the parallel with the 1940's that Lyn Alden has pushed. 
The 1940's saw very high, but very transitory inflation. We have much more debt now, and floating exchange rates.
