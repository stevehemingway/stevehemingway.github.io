## Weekend comment

For most of my long adult life, yields have trended down.
This is explained in a variety of ways, but mostly in terms of an ever declining productivity of capital and excessively tight monetary conditions.
In the developed world, credit creation has been extremely weak, as banks have much preferred to lend to governments than to the private sector.
The collapse of yields has been a symptom of this.
This chart illustrates the history.

The recent rise in 10Y yields is not, on this timescale too scary.
However, a few things are different now:

- debt levels have never been higher, because of a massive spend by many governments to offset the collapse in demand from the pandemic,

- There is a shooting war in Europe that a major nuclear power is directly involved in and might lose,

- ESG and the war have pushed up energy prices to the highest levels seen in decades,

- globalism has gone into reverse, as a result of the pandemic and the war, as manufacturers have discovered the extreme fragility of their supply chains,

- food prices in some very unstable nation states are spiking, at exactly the same time as the governments of these countries will have a great deal of problems financing these deficits,

- MMT, the economic theory that says that in the developed world governments can spend essentially without limit, has become widely known and popular,

- the collapse in spending power has change the political climate in many countries, with Friedmanite policies extremely unpopular, especially among the youth.

I don't know if this stuff is true. I just think it's interesting:

A suggestion that the EU will try to ban transactions to unhosted crypto wallets.

Why India supports Russia (basically, because the US supports Pakistan, but there is a lot of interesting other history here):
