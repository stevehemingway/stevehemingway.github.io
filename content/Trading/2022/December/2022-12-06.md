[This article](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/500-bps-rate-cuts-deck) argues that the Fed is going to have to cut, and cut a lot, creating a huge steepening. 
Maybe the crash in oil prices (and the downturn in stocks, which amounts to a tightening) will be the nail in the coffin of further above-expectation rate hikes.

## Wrap
Most energy commodities were hammered today. The following is Trading Economics gloss on the move:

> WTI crude futures dropped more than 4% to below $74 per barrel, the lowest since December 2021, as sentiment remained clouded by concerns about weak global demand. Advanced economies, especially the US and Europe, are witnessing a drop in manufacturing activity due to tightening financial conditions. On top of that, better-than-expected US services and jobs data stoked worries that the Fed will need to remain aggressive for longer. Still looking for the demand side but putting a floor under prices, China has been dialing back virus curbs following widespread protests, with several cities scrapping testing requirements that have hindered movement in the worldâ€™s top crude importer. On the supply front, OPEC+ decided to stick to their existing policy of reducing oil output by 2 million barrels a day from November through 2023. Investors were also assessing the impact of the latest sanctions on Russia, including a price cap and a European Union embargo on seaborne imports of Russian oil.

I read in the FT that a price cap of $60/barrel will make essentially no difference to Russia, as that's what it's oil is selling at now.

Gas and energy usage in Europe has dropped a lot, as industry has put off consumption, and the weather has been very mild for October and November. It's cold now (believe it, I am freezing!).

The oil crash dragged down all risk assets and has increased the bear flattening, with 10Y yields down nearly 9bp. Practically every last global stock-market was down a point or two.

## Universities, subjects, selectivity and their effects on graduate income
[This](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537122001580?via%3Dihub) is rather interesting. Going to a highly selective institution, to study a competitive subject like economics, makes a big difference to your earnings potential. 
I believe that this is mostly down to signalling effects, but that doesn't make it any less real.

It's interesting how economics is such an outlier subject. Studying it makes a bigger impact on future earnings than studying law or medicine, or even computer science. 

It's a bit depressing that studying maths, physics or chemistry have such a meh effect on earnings potential.
