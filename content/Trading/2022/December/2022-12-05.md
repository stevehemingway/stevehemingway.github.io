[It seems](https://www.fabricatedknowledge.com/p/trend-watch-edition-1?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) that consumers of cosmetics are switching from skincare to fragrances, 
and Millennials are giving up vaping and switching to smoking. Weird, or what?

Intuit (seller of expensive bookkeeping and tax-accounting software and accidental owner of Mailchimp and Credit Karma) is in trouble, [according to Edwin Dorsey](https://thebearcave.substack.com/p/problems-at-intuit-intu).
Oddly enough, I've used Mailchimp, Quickbooks and Credit Karma. I think, ages ago, I even paid for a copy of Quickbooks. I did notice that Credit Karma does do a lot of heavy selling of credit cards, although I've trained myself to ignore that sort of crap.
