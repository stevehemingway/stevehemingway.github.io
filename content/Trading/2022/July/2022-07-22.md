## Hollow men

Ben Hunt has a compelling message. 
It's that unconventional monetary theory, practice in Japan, the US, and basically throughout the developed world, is destabilizing because it systematically increases inequality.
He says it in a rather verbose style, which reduces his impact, in my view. You can read an example [here](https://www.epsilontheory.com/hollow-men-hollow-markets-hollow-world-2/). To be fair, he sort of admits that the preambles to his posts are a distraction,
and that he has stopped doing it. 
The linked post is an old favourite, so still has the 'schtick'.

Lots of people have pointed out the disproportionate returns to capital over labour over the last forty years.
Hunt identifies a cause. Whereas different economies have had different experiences, and globalization has done a lot of damage, 
as well as the entry of women into the professional workforce in very large number, quantitative easing has certainly not helped.

## Worth reading

[Chronic illness makes UK workforce the sickest in developed world](https://www.ft.com/content/c333a6d8-0a56-488c-aeb8-eeb1c05a34d2).
(Sorry, this is paywalled.)
Interesting article about how long-term illness has a disproportionate impact on the size of the UK workforce, as a percentage of the working-age population.
The article identifies the failures of the NHS. 
I suspect that's a factor, but it's complicated, as the interesting discussion in the FT after the article makes clear.

## Wrap

Michael Burry tweeted that it was wrong for Nancy Pelosi's husband to be allowed to make trades which almost certainly are informed by inside information from his wife.
The latest case was Nvidia, where a bill to give large subsidies to semiconductor companies who do fabrication in the USA must have been known about by Nancy Pelosi before it became public information.

Snapchat cratered. Unprofitable big tech is a sector to avoid.

Oil sank: this week's movement has been dire as recession seems increasingly likely.
The ECB seems to be determined to drive Europe into recession.
