title: Equities still far from cheap

# Thursday 14, July 2022

## Equities are still very expensive!

[Longtermtrends](https://www.longtermtrends.net/) is a great resource. It comes out with a monthly newsletter.
This relatively low frequency washes out most of the noise which is characteristic of so many market price measures.

[The current edition](https://australis.eocampaign1.com/web-version?ep=2&lc=2c0e57c9-0070-11ec-96e5-06b4694bee2a&p=1ce6e87d-ffca-11ec-9258-0241b9615763&pt=campaign&t=1657710132&s=4ae16c1326d5edd62c818bd8d532c61730d062dd45c8e7d1d9fc373133fce0a8) has some measures of where the stock market is, after its bruising fall.
The answer is: still pretty expensive, according to most metrics.
On a trailing p/e and dividend measure, it doesn't look _too_ bad, but with interest rates rising, it'll have to look better still to avoid having to fall further.
