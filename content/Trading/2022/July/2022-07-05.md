## UK political news

Sajid Javid and Rishi Sunak, NHS Secretary and Chancellor have resigned their cabinet posts.
Boris Johnson has been the target of relentless contempt from mainstream media, 
principally for telling bare-faced lies (allegedly).

The pound sank 1.3% to less than $1.20.
Gilts rallied to a 10Y yield of 2.05%.
Given that the assumption is that Johnson will try to buy votes with borrowed money, this seems an odd reaction, 
but it may simply be following a global trend. US Treasuries rallied to, with 10Y yields falling by 12bp (vs 14 for the gilts).
The chaos in the Conservative government must increase the chance of a more left-wing government.
Conventional market reaction would be to mark gilts down, although its hard to imagine a  Labour government running 
deficits nearly as high as the current government has done over the last couple of years (for entirely justifiable reasons, I should add).

## Wrap

The oil complex crashed. 
Brent and WTI dropped by 8% and 9.3%.
There seems to be no obvious catalyst for this, apart from the general fact that every other real asset with the exception of oil fallen further.
Given that the Middle East seems to be at or near capacity, that Russia is both struggling to keep its production going and struggling to find willing buyers, that oil production workers in Norway are about to go on strike, 
and that most (but not all) forecasts are for a fairly steep recovery in oil prices, given that the world now is largely running on negative real interest rates.

Of course, a recession is expected, Russia has claimed to have found new reserves, and the US dollar is going up rapidly. These will weigh on the price of oil (and in the case of the first and last, on the price of pretty much every commodity).
