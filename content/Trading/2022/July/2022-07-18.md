## Macro trends

Crescat produces a first class monthly newsletter [this month](https://www.crescat.net/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-consumer/) it identifies the following macro trends:

- Real interest rates dropping
- Consumer sentiment dropping
- Dropping real consumer income
- Corporate margin squeeze looming
- Raw materials structurally higher
- Labour costs rising steeply (at least in nominal terms)
- High housing cost inflation 
- Unemployment probably going to bounce back
- Tech layoffs coming
- EM bond spreads exploding
- Yen ceases to be a safe haven 

(The focus is US, but most of these trends would apply equally to Europe.)

There are lots of nice charts to illustrate the points. 
I like this one:

It's very hard to time trades to take full advantage of these trends, but it is probably worth the effort.

Classic inflation trades, such as short credit, short long-dated treasuries, long precious metals, long diversified commodities, long energy should all work. But it's a lot harder making this work than you'd think

Equities are tricky. Tech stocks (outside of the FAANGMAN) have been hammered. 
Different sectors respond differently: miners should be OK, consumer discretionary, maybe not.
Overall, though, equities surely have further to fall (that's Crescat's take too).
