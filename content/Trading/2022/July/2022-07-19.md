title: It's too hot

# Tuesday 19, July 2022

## Heat exhaustion

In my office today, the temperature hit 36.4 deg. C.
That's too hot. It's 34.8C now, which is still too hot.

## Wrap.

Rampant risk-on.
NDX up 3% on no news.
In fact, BofA Global Fund Manager Survey showed lowest equity allocation since Lehman Bros. and highest cash levels since 2001.

I guess we're well into BTFD territory.

## Stock Picks

Rubellite Energy Inc. (RBY.TO) seems worth taking a look.
No debt, forward P/E 7.4.
Seems to have net cash.
It's a subsidiary of Perpetual Energy, but separately listed.

I saw this touted on some newsletter, so it's probably a Ponzi.
You've been warned!
