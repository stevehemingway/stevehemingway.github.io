## Organic farming as cause of Sri Lanka coup

[In Sri Lanka, Organic Farming Went Catastrophically Wrong](https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/05/sri-lanka-organic-farming-crisis/) is an article in Foreign Policy.
I don't know much about the publication, so the account may suffer from bias.
But the facts seem to be clear: organic farming is woefully unproductive.
In the West, farming is increasing an excercise in extracting rents from the state.
In the UK, net value added by agriculture rounds to zero percent of GDP.
Nevertheless, it's a huge factor in politics, as you'd expect.
([the UK's 50 biggest landowners](https://tlio.org.uk/the-uks-50-biggest-landowners-revealed-lovemoney-com/) are mostly not members of the Labour Party.

The direction of UK policy seems to be in the direction of becoming more 'ecological'. I hope that the damaging policies of Sri Lanka are not followed, but at least we still can import the food we need to eat.
