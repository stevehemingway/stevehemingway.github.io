## Has the time come for corporate debt to have its time in the sun?

Cpo

[SOM Macro Strategies](https://www.sommacrostrategies.com/) argues in its latest newsletter that higer rates  will benefit corporate credit. The idea seems to be that interest cost is fully allowable, and that as CBs pause the current tightening cycle, corporate debt will start to benefit.
I am still nervous about going long debt into a recession, but I guess that it is logical that in a recession rates collapse, and that equity takes the first hit. 
SOM points out that in inflation-adjusted terms, debt in SP500 companies isn't particularly high. It suggests that as rates come back down, firms will start to buy back debt, supporting the price.

While I sort of understand the thesis, the $AGG ETF, which is a portfolio of corporate credit, does not look too healthy:

## Lula wins
Lula is the new president of Brazil. 
Let's hope he does a better job than last time.
Maybe the stockmarket will bounce with a sigh of relief.
