title: The hedge fund manager Sings

# Today's random thoughts
- [Paul Singer of Elliott Management has warned that hyperinflation is around the corner. ](https://www.ft.com/content/f3bb0f96-1816-4481-8318-4f7583326a4a) Clearly, it's not all about supply bottlenecks, but CB's don't like to take the blame.
- Everyone hates copper, uranium, gold, silver. Maybe it's time to go long some producers. For example, $FCX, $CCJ, $GOLD, $PAAS. Not a recommendation, but they are all very hated right now. If we really are getting hyperinflation, Barrick Gold could literally be a gold mine. Uh, OK, it would be anyway.
- The gilts meltdown has shown the markets how quickly things can get ugly. The market have decided that gilts are a safe bet again, but how can they be sure that rebellious Conservative MPs who are going to be out of parliament next time can be whipped into voting for austerity yet again? If they don't the finance bill will not pass and gilts will melt down again.
- Will China open up silently and boost demand for copper etc.? I have no idea, but I doubt if Xi will tell the world before he tells his cronies.
- [Antonio Foglia attributes the strength of the US dollar to unwinding of hedging trades](https://www.ft.com/content/0387c6fd-1c18-4ea8-bb70-bfa6b4537347) The argument is that if the US Long Bond has dropped by 20%, foreign holders who buy it for yield but then hedge out the FX risk by selling spot USD will have had to buy back a lot of spot USD to keep themselves hedged. If they lose interest in USTs, this will happen more. Sounds more plausible than [the milkshake theory](https://money-act.com/milkshake-theory/) although much less compelling from a visual point of view.
## Fear and loathing on the road to QT
[This](https://www.ft.com/content/f86779b2-f5d0-4376-b109-ae12ff94b04e) is fantastic:
  
> What has gone away is our ability to hide the problem. QE, negative interest rates and rising indebtedness were the product and palliative of a condition caused by a prolonged deceleration in productivity growth to an average pace not seen since the 19th century. Real wages stagnated for several decades on the back of this deceleration, whilst asset prices soared due to the evaporation of risk-free interest rates. By redistributing shares of wealth and income to the high-saving top 10 per cent, the economic mix ensured that demand and inflation fell short, simultaneously dismantling the social contract that keeps politics non-toxic. Meanwhile, zero interest rates worsened the productivity slowdown by artificially prolonging the lifespan of the least productive enterprises. Then came Covid. In an economic condition of parlous growth, most developed countries responded to the shock by spending money, largely financed by central bank printing presses â€” some 13 per cent of GDP in the UK, 21 per cent in the US. This was a live experiment with the magic money tree, a policy long advocated as an antidote for the slow growth condition.

ZIRP has anaesthetized politics, but we're waking up from narcosis into a world of fear and loathing. Eventually, something has to give, and there will be some redistribution and a return to normal productivity growth (which, in the long run really is everything).

# The cost of Net Zero
