title: US Equities Puke

# Friday 21, January 2022


## Wrap

I don't have time to write much.
Basically this was another risk-off day:

- US equity indexes off ~2% (NDX 2.8%),
- all OECD govt. bonds up,
- risk off currencies (JPY, EUR) up, USD fairly flat but DXY slightly down,
- commodities massacred, except gas, which always is like that,
- some big FAANG stocks taking a hit: $AMZN and $TSLA down > 5%. So much for Crazy Cathie's strategy of hedging with $AAPL. (TBF, it's only down 1%),


This is all attributed to worry that the Fed will tighten.

The power of the Fed to influence the real economy and securities markets has been greatly exaggerated.
A superb essay by Henry Curr [here](https://spe.org.uk/site/assets/files/8729/money_printers_go_grr.pdf) goes 
through the detail.
This is an oustanding piece of work.
If only a few politicians would read it!
