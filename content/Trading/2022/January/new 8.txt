$DKS
$ASO 
$HIBB

Also $BBBY and maybe $FL -- Bed Bath etc. and Footlocker.

also DBX, TWTR, SFIX

SFIX is interesting. It's a 'clothes on approval' service. I think a lot of people want to buy clothes on the internet, but 
don't want the hassle of searching a lot of websites.
It is barely covering its costs, but the review in Cosmo was good.
It's run by IT people, so actually it should deliver.
We know that women are very fussy about clothes, and this is a first pass solution.
