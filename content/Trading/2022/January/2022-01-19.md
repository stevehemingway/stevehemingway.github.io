Wonderful post from [Alessandro Blasi of the IEA](://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandro-blasi-6579a66/) on LinkedIn recently.

## 10 Myths in energy and climate world (2022 update): 1Ô∏è‚É£

1. Renewables n.1 source electricity production: False. Coal is the king and by (long) distance
2.	Electricity = energy: wrong!  - Electricity Ô∏ès less than 25% of total  nergy consumed
3Ô∏è. Coal demand is declining: false ‚Äì electricity from coal at new record highs and total coal demand might see a new record in 2022!
4Ô∏è‚É£. Oil = cars : False.  - petrochemicals, trucks and planes (pending - covid19) are key drivers of  oil demand‚Ä®
5Ô∏è‚É£. # Covid19 =  peakoil. Uhmmm, oil demand in 2022 expected to be already higher than pre-COVID
6‚É£- Power ‚ö°Ô∏è is the n.1 source of emissions: false, more than 60% comes from industry Ìø≠, transport Ì†Ω etc‚Ä®
7Ô∏è‚É£. The Majors dominate the - oil and gas industry: false. Those companies account ‚Äòonly‚Äô for 12% of global - oilgas reserves and 15% of total - production
8‚É£. End of the fossil fuels era: (dramatically) wrong. Those still account for almost 80% of the total, exactly as 30 years ago‚Ä®
9‚É£.Wind and solar dominate low carbon #power: (still) false. hydropower leads, followed by #nuclear!‚Ä®‚Ä®Ì†Ω
10. #Emissions have finally peaked: unfortunately everything points towards a new all-time records in 2022‚Ä¶
