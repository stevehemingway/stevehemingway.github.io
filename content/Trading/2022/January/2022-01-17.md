## Wrap

Interest rates are on the move!
Eurodollar futures continue to trade lower.
Bonds, US and EU are weaker.
Commodities are generally up: oil has had a very strong run since before Christmas.
This almost exactly matches the systematic move up in 10Y yields for Treasuries.
This key rate is now 1.79%.
Usually, such a move would weaken the USD vs JPY, but the movement has not been consistent.
The Yen has weakened from around 113 to 114, but the move has not been monotonic.

## Canadian energy companies

Canadian energy companies all seem to be getting bid. Here is a list of small-cap ones.
Do your own research, but by all means use this list as a starting point.
