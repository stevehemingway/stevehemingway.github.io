## The housing market
Desired saving.
Distrust of securities markets.
QE and zero interest rate policy driving down returns on money-like assets.
Literal visibility of asset class.
Obsessive coverage of house price indexes by mass media.
High fees and offputting tone of financial advisors.
High visibility and faded memory of house prices falling.
Diverts savings from productive uses.
Calculation that politicians will always step in to prop up a falling housing market in a way that 
they would not for other asset classes.
Broken planning system throttling supply.
