## The housing market
Desired saving.
Distrust of securities markets.
QE and zero interest rate policy driving down returns on money-like assets.
Literal visibility of asset class.
Obsessive coverage of house price indexes by mass media.
High fees and offputting tone of financial advisors.
High visibility and faded memory of house prices falling.
Diverts savings from productive uses.
Calculation that politicians will always step in to prop up a falling housing market in a way that 
they would not for other asset classes.
Broken planning system throttling supply.

## Kwateng
Kwasi Kwateng, the new Chancellor in the UK wrote an op-ed in the FT a few days ago saying that Truss's government would be pro-growth. 
He talked about cutting taxes, as if taxes collected do not get spent into the economy.
He talked about the UK having basically negligible labour productivity growth for at least fifteen years (coincidentally, since the Conservatives have been part or all of government, but he didn't mention that), and that some OECD report had said that financial conditions in the UK were tightening, not loosening.

He seemed to think that loose financial conditions, and growth in the economy were the same as improved labour productivity. Of course, this is nonsense. Often loose financial conditions lead to slack growth, since the pressure on business to produce more with less is relieved by the cushion of cheap debt. Indeed, debt now for many borrowers must carry an interest rate which is negative in real terms. Maybe crashing equity markets account for a notional tightening, but to spike the punchbowl with vodka at this stage in the party seems like a bad mistake to me. Especially if the BoE is frantically trying to take said punchbowl away. Well, we are overdue for a a bit of civil unrest. I await the outcome with interest.

Basically, trashing a bunch of ARKK-type stocks. Easy to do, but in this case done well.
