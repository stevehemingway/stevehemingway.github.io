## Wrap
A couple of Fed Presidents (Evans, Mester and Kashkari) are reassuring markets, which went down but bounced a bit to end just a tiny bit down ($NDX up 0.5%, $SPX down 9bp).
Bond yields were up everywhere, but especially in the UK where gilt yields (10Y) were up 25bp.
The Euro and JPY were down, but the GBP was flat after three days of heavy selling.
