## Geeky

[winpty](https://github.com/rprichard/winpty) is an incredibly handy utility to use if you want to use bash with windows.
Basically, it allows programs that are expecting a windows cli (powershell or cmd) to run under bash.

I have no idea how it does it, or really the difference between how these two 'terminals' differ in terms of reading from stdin, but it is just magic.

One thing I use it for all the time is to run unison under git bash.  Unison is a fantastic file synchronization program, written in OCaml (no, I don't know what that is either). It works a dream as is open source, so you can check it's bug free, assuming you want to learn an obscure new functional language (JK).
