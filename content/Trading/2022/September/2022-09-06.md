## What will Europe do with no Russian gas?

This guy seems to have a compelling story. 
Democratic governments will have no option but to print money to give subsidies to consumers (residential and business) of energy.
This will drag down the euro, and euro-area bonds.
The spike in the dollar will crash emerging market economies, and cause defaults on their bonds. In the run-up, these governments will sell US Treasuries which will push up US yields even further, in the face of a rising dollar.

@fejau_inc also speculates that the Fed will do all it can to hold down the rise of the dollar by buying EUR and JPY via central bank swap lines. They are already worried about maintaining liquidity with commercial bank counterparties (see quoted tweet from @deltaone). The next step is complicated, as he concedes. Either the Fed will pivot, drive down rates to zero one more time and re-inflate the bond bubble, or we'll get financial Armaggedon. He inclines to the latter course, but as Kashkari points out, the Fed can print infinite numbers of dollars, and people want them.

He also thinks that even though the dollar will go up, so will oil. Given the dire (downward) performance of oil prices lately, that's a bold call. I can believe that oil priced in yen will spike, but in USD? I'm not so sure.


## Wrap

The dollar strength seems to be the leitmotif of today. DXY was up another 0.6% to 110.22. This drove down everything, including nearly all equity markets and all commodities. (A few odd ones, like coal were up, but to a good first approx.) 
US yields were up, i.e. bonds were down, in spite of the tightening effect of a higher dollar on the US economy.
