## Wrap

US CPI hit 8.5%.
Oil (WTI front month) went up 6.8%, to above $100 a barrel again.
Bonds were fairly subdued: supply shocks may yet provide enough tightening to avoid hitting full employment and the resultant 
change into excess demand driving inflation.
It seems likely that the US economy may be approaching full employment. We are not there, but the bounce from the extreme slackness of Q2 2020 looks likely to overshoot, provoking an over-reaction from the Fed which plunges the world into recession ... just as it did for every recession since 53-54, with the sole exception of the Covid panic of 2020.
