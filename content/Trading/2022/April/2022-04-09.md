## Green Agenda

This tweet caught my eye.
I don't know or care if Obama believes in AGW and its likely effects on sea levels.
I care about the fact that this person, who was given great power and continuing influence, as well as huge wealth, through the support of the Democratic Party, 
now cares so little about this party that he (seemingly) engages in ostentatious displays of wealth, which erodes the support for his party in the constituency (the poor) that it purports to represent.
