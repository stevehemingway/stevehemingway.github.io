## Wrap 

GDP was a big miss, but FB earnings were a big beat, so the indexes responded positively.
The dollar continued to rise, as did energy and food.
Tesla and Alibaba were exceptions, but most US-listed stocks rose.
Crypto joined the party, with a 1.8% bounce for $BTC.

I still think that the direction of travel for stocks is down. Earnings are a backward looking indicator, but with so much stock shorted, a big earnings beat like $FB can give rise to a short squeeze.

## Thoughts

The general idea of public choice theory is that to understand the behaviour of institutions one has to understand the incentives facing the individuals who run those institutions.
This is most obviously, and productively, applied to politics, but I think it can be applied to other institutions.
In education, those who run the institutions (the university administrators) seek to maximize fee and endowment income 
rather than the income of those who graduate.
In religion, the hieratic class are focussed on amassing devotees, and wealth, rather than on saving souls and helping the poor, although charitable works do help achieve the other goals.
In charities, the status and comfort of the trustees and administrators often comes above the beneficiaries as 
defined by the constitutional duties.
I could go on, but you get the idea.
