Stanley Druckenmiller is a legendary trader, with a record which is a lot better than Warren Buffett's, in terms of annual consistency.
He looks at economics, industry characteristics, accounts, market liquidity and charts. 
Interestingly, he doesn't believe that technical analysis is voodoo. 
He particularly believes in taking concentrated bets, but with a willingness to flip positions very rapidly.

The classic momentum strategy of letting winners run and realizing early losses is the strategy of Jerry Parker.
He was interviewed on this week's Market Huddle. His approach is to have a lot of (dilute?) positions, in many markets, and 
apply the mechanical rules of trend following "and nothing else" religiously. 
This has done well for him. Druckenmiller's technique has done well for him. Either they could have both got lucky, or there could be more than
one route to success when managing investments.
