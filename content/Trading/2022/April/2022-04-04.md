## Wrap

Elon Musk took a 9.2% stake in Twitter, sending its shares to the stratosphere.
This knocked all the mega cap names higher, which resulted in the Nasdaq rising 2%.
The broader index, the SPX, rose only 0.8%.

The announcement that Special Petroleum Reserve was being raided, to help the Democrats win votes in the coming mid-term elections
failed to stop oil rising. WTI crude (near month) was up 4.43%. Nearly all industrial and food commodities were dragged up by oil.

The Japanese yen is looking very weak, and the dollar strong. 
$DXY reached 99 today.

Bonds were unimpressed. The 10Y yield is a fraction below 2.4%, as a redemption yield.


## Twitter

I think this is a reference to Hunter Biden's laptop.
I don't think you have to be a conspiracy theorist to think that the CIA has caused millions of unnecessary deaths over the last century.
I don't have proof, and the alternative might have been worse, but a lot of important decisions have been made with minimal democratic oversight.
