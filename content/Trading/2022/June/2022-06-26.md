title: Is inflation the result of anti-competitive behaviour of firms?

## ABM Industries

We seem to have drifted into a stealth bear market. It's hard to make money on the long side, as long as the bear is in control, 
but as the tide turns profits are (in principle) waiting to be taken. [This post](https://www.overlookedalpha.com/p/abm-industries-a-safe-place-to-ride?r=nmbt&s=r&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=email) gives the bull case for ABM Industries.
I am always a bit sceptical of freesheet analysis. If I were doing good analysis, the last thing I'd do is give it away for free, so if I see a buy recommendation, I assume that the author is looking to close his position.
I know that's awfully cynical, but ... 

## Central Banks facing unpalatable choices

[Graham Benjamin's Newsletter](https://grahamsbenjamins.substack.com) is worth a read. 
[His latest piece](https://grahamsbenjamins.substack.com/p/a-pivotal-problem-for-central-banks?r=nmbt&s=r&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web) explains that as holders of massive amounts of long-dated govt. debt and corporate credit (and equities, in some cases such as the SNB and the BoJ), CBs simply cannot afford for financial asset prices to go down. 
Obviously, any losses on govt. bonds held by the banks are simply gains for the issuers of these bonds: the govts. that control the banks.
But CBs don't see it that way.
As Benjamin says, brace yourself for aggressive inflation busting.

## Monopoly power as a driver of inflation

Inflation is prices going up. The gross income for companies is a product of their volume of sales and the cost of those sales.
Labour is one input cost. Bought-in goods and services is another. The other is the cost of finance, i.e. the returns to suppliers of capital.
Profits have been going up, since the peak of the lockdown. 
It looks like this might be a result of high levels of concentration in industry.
[Matt Stoller argues for this](https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/on-inflation-its-the-monopoly-profits?utm_source=email) and he makes a very convincing case.
OK, it's hard to demonstrate that lack of competition is a true cause, especially to explain the exact timing of the jump in margins,
but a couple of academic studies he reports on appear to back this up.
To me, it seems intuititively obvious that the rigors of the pandemic knocked out the weaker players in many sectors, 
which would then result in the survivors having more pricing power.
