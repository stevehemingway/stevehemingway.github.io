title: Risk On Monday

# Monday  6, June 2022

## Wrap

Basically, today was a mild risk-on.
Equities were up, bonds down, commodities up, crypto up, VIX down.
There may be excitement next week when a lot of options (especially puts) expire.
No major economic news. Saudi Arabia seems to have increased prices for crude for July.

## Reddit

I plan to post to Reddit, in a subreddit called r/stevehemingway. I am writing some code which will (hopefully) largely automate posting there. I think the interaction will be better than using disqus.
