## Farmland
[The Chicago Fed survey indicates a huge increase in land values for "good" farmland.](https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/agletter/2020-2024/august-2022)

> Farmland values for the Seventh Federal Reserve District rose 22 percent in the second quarter of 2022 from a year earlier, roughly matching the year-over-year gains of the previous two quarters. Values for “good” agricultural land were up 2 percent in the second quarter of 2022 from the first quarter, according to survey responses from 137 banks in the District. Twenty-five percent of the survey respondents forecasted higher District farmland values during the July through September period of 2022, and 4 percent forecasted lower values; given the greater share of optimistic next-quarter projections reported by the previous six surveys, the results from the most recent survey suggested shrinking expectations for farmland values to increase during the third quarter of 2022.

## The rise of plutocracy
The trend of Gini coefficients is interesting. 
Globally, between countries, it's going down (a good thing: a zero Gini means each country )
