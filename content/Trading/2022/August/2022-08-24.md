# The sausage machine

Stephen Semler writes a substack exposing venality and hypocrisy in US Federal policitics. You can read his latest [here](https://stephensemler.substack.com/p/why-isnt-the-ira-bigger-and-better?r=nmbt&s=r&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=email)
I always regret reading this stuff. It sickens me to write about it and it's not even my country, so I absolutely have no ability to change the system.
I guess I read it out for the same sort of reasons that makes me glance at smoking wrecks on the hard shoulder of the motorway when I should be concentrating on the road ahead. 
It's a sort of indication of stuff that can happen if you're not careful.
And a reminder that once it has happened, it's very hard to undo the damage. 
Semler quotes David Serota: 

> _Put simply: In order to have any chance of passing a budget bill with huge investments in clean energy, our kleptocratic politics requires a corruption tithe â€” in this case, funding for [roads](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/02/us/roads-infrastructure-bill.html) and [airports](https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2021-08-03/infrastructure-package-calls-25b-more-aviation) and [all sorts of other carbon pollution](https://www.worldoil.com/news/2021/8/9/climate-groups-claim-infrastructure-bill-s-green-energy-spend-is-a-gift-to-oil-companies) that big donors want, but that might not be advisable in the era of cataclysmic climate change._

I don't think we're quite there yet in the UK, but we're definitely moving in the same direction.
Vast amounts of work for government is done by PWC and co., as a sort of freebie, but just like their ain't no such thing as a free lunch, there ain't no such thing as a free policy paper.

Bismarck (possibly) advised that it was better not to see how sausages are made, and that the same goes for laws. 
Good economics is usually bad politics, and payment of a modest corruption tithe probably is the best we can achieve, but we should at least acknowledge the existence of this tithe, and take the cheap obvious methods to minimize it, not least to fund a strong, independent, non-partisan civil service that does not need to be supported by legions of consultants.

## PMI malaise

The *Daily Shot* today had a whole list of charts showing deep gloom from the purchasing managers community. (Seriously, has anyone every met a purchasing manager? Are these creatures an more real that phoenixes or griffins?)
