## Wrap

This week ended with a whimper. The tone is vaguely risk-off, but hardly dramatically so.
The markets seem to think that some slowdown is on the cards, although only marginally so.
Equities in the US paused, with all the indices down on the week, but bonds took the opposite track, 
with yields up, slightly, on the week.
Commodities were pretty flat, although lumber was down a lot, presumably a reflection of the state of the US housing market. Most energies were quite weak, apart from gas, which was very strong.

Ten year yields are still under 3%. This seems very low at this stage of the cycle. 
In the seventies, we had loads of workers, loads of cheap minerals, vast labour and other resources in developing countries to exploit, and the subsequent return to normal was completely free from serious conflicts directly affecting the West. None of these things apply today.
