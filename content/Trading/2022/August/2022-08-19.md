## Wrap

This week ended with a whimper. The tone is vaguely risk-off, but hardly dramatically so.
The markets seem to think that some slowdown is on the cards, although only marginally so.
Equities in the US paused, with all the indices down on the week, but bonds took the opposite track, 
with yields up, slightly, on the week.
Commodities were pretty flat, although lumber was down a lot, presumably a reflection of the state of the US housing market. Most energies were quite weak, apart from gas, which was very strong.

Ten year yields are still under 3%. The idea that with the inflation we are experiencing now will drop back to such a low level within the decade seems unlikely to me.
Labour productivity is not growing anything like as fast as it used to, 
The massive entry of a billion Chinese workers (and a lot of Mexicans and Indians etc.)
