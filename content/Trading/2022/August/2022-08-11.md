# Leaky buckets
Arthur Okun likened taxes to leaky buckets.
The leaks are the unintended consequences and lost revenue caused by the change of peoples behaviour in response to the imposing of the tax.

[Roger Lowenstein wrote a piece about the latest omnibus bill passed by the US Senate replaced a proposed bucket with very small leaks with one with a giant hole in it.](https://rogerlowenstein.substack.com/p/policy-and-tradeoffs) 

The awfulness of the tax on buybacks is that it gives tax relief to companies gifting shares to their own executives. A pure win for the executive class.
