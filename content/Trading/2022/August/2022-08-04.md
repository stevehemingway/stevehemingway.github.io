> Muddy Waters is short Sunrun Inc. (RUN) because we see it as an uneconomic business built on three shaky pillars: The equity story of exaggerated “Subscriber Values” and “Gross / Net Earning Assets”, funding growth through abusing tax incentives, and issuing ABS that could be exposed to a RUN bankruptcy. These pillars, in turn, are built on a foundation of dubious financial models. If one of these three pillars wobbles, RUN would likely face a funding gap and would require equity issuances to continue growing. Insiders have already become ultra-wealthy, having net sold shares since July 2020 for $205.9 million. RUN is on its third CFO since January 2020.

Basically, this is a solar panel installation company.
It sells batteries too.
It makes no profits, and burns through $2mmm a year, on a revenue of $1.77 pa. 
It pays out $170mm of SBC and for some bizarre reason spent $1.75 mmm on PPE in the last twelve months.

Frankly, there is no bull case for this stock, except that a Ponzi can keep operating longer than you can avoid a margin call.
