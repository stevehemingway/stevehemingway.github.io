Oil and other commodites slumped. Near month of WTI dropped 3.2%.
Coal and gas were up, but mostly commodities were down.
The further dated futures didn't go down much.
It's dangerous to read to much into this (I think the market makers just widen their spreads on the more illiquid contracts on a day like this, without having a settled view of how the forward curve is likely to change shape).

I haven't a clue where the stock market is going, but I feel that it's due for a 
violent correction. Maybe it's time to go long volatility with some one- or two-month tight strangles or straddles on SPY or similar. Implied vols on US equities seem very low.

Unions have been purged from the private sector. The resulting collapse in the share of income received by the working class ()
