## The US Treasury curve inversion

There are a lot of measures of yields and discount curves.
Looking at raw T-bill yields is not ideal, because they have cash flows at all sorts of dates.
However, there is clearly a material difference between the duration of the 10Y note and the 2Y one, and if you track that over time it does tend to signal trouble ahead.

We are now facing trouble.
