aesthetic/planning reasons)

## First Floor

### F01
- ED05 to be non-opening
- extra velux above stairs (if possible)
- is W21 needed?

### F02
- west wall as gable-end/hipped to give more usable space
- move ID08 by 90degrees and as part of wall where ID10 currently is
(removing chimney to help make F02 a better space, use more of the
landing as part of the bedroom, F03 repurposed as storage)

### F04
