[Mark Rubenstein always sounds as though he knows everything about anything he writes about.](https://www.netinterest.co/p/harnessing-the-power-of-insurance-9ad?r=nmbt&s=r&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web) Of course, he always writes about technical issues affecting the financial sector, so even though he claims to be 'probing the perimeter of my circle of competence' he's not going too far out on a limb. I have no problem with that: I much prefer to read stuff by people who are informed.
