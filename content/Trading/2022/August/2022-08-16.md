# ESG and anti-ESG
I understand why people like the idea of ESG. 
I understand that cynical, hard-nosed hustlers want to muscle in to profit on what the mass of suckers want.
I guess this explains Blackrock's obsession with ESG, but I am not totally sure.
Recently, coal companies have done fantastically well, notably Thungela, a spinoff from Anglo-American, which wanted to qualify for inclusion in 
popular ETFs. 

You can now invest in an [anti-ESG ETF](https://www.wealthmanagement.com/equities/6040-strategy-will-beat-inflation-eventually-survey-shows?mc_cid=d7698c973f&mc_eid=2acb0e81b4), as Kuppy points out (sorry no link, but it's in an email promo. for KEDM.com).
Of course, you could always invest in coal or oil directly.
