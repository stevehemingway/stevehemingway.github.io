title: USD is the worst currency apart from all the rest

## US demographics are bad but still way better than China, Germany or Japan.

The world is running out of people. At least, it's running out of people of working age.
Labour and capital are complementary factors of production.
A collapse in labour supply will depress demand for capital, and with it returns on capital.
This is why global rates have been so low, and why central banks want to get rid of cash.
(They want to deny savers the option of keeping notes under the mattress.)

The world is in a bad shape, but the least bad part of it is the USA, especially if it does not get taken over by Trumpians hell-bent on building walls at the border with Mexico.

The conclusion of all this is bullish for USD, just like Brent Johnson said.

## Wrap

(Written before London close, because I am leaving early.)
Today was a massive risk rebound. Yields, equities, commodities, non-US currencies, crypto all jumped.
Polkadot cryto token (me neither) jumped 37%, as Terra & Luna are pulled down in a death spira.
Near-dated oil futures jumped 3.5%, but the longer-dated contracts moved much less (i.e. the backwardation increased).

There didn't seem any obvious catalyst for this. Presumably, it was just the market getting ahead of itself, and deciding on a bear market rally. Or, maybe that's it: the whole drop in risk assets over the last week or so was just a bull market pullback.
I haven't the faintest idea what's going on, but it's interesting that $VOLQ (the NDX vol index) was over 38 yesterday, whereas it has read as low as 18 only this year (back in Jan).
