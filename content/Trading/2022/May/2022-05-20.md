title: Why the USA has a shortage of formula milk. 

# Friday 20, May 2022

I was too busy today to make a regular post, so I just noted a few interesting things I read recently.

## Things I've read

* [Who's driving the crypto bus?](https://mtcbd.substack.com/p/macrotactical-crypto-17?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTAyMDI1LCJwb3N0X2lkIjo1NDA1MTcxNywiXyI6IjJTQkZvIiwiaWF0IjoxNjUzMDM3NjkyLCJleHAiOjE2NTMwNDEyOTIsImlzcyI6InB1Yi03MTUzODMiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.eHLgXuC3P_PiQxvcPmAKgmTh3TSU0lMtiMNSuHYSER4&s=r) Brent Donnelly points out that there are tight correlations across seemingly unrelated markets, but that when examined more closely these turn out to be so unrelated after all. He applies that to crypto markets.

* [The formula milk shared monopoly](https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/big-bottle-the-baby-formula-nightmare?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTAyMDI1LCJwb3N0X2lkIjo1NDQ5NjY4OCwiXyI6IjJTQkZvIiwiaWF0IjoxNjUzMDQ3MjM0LCJleHAiOjE2NTMwNTA4MzQsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0xMTUyNCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.wRTAM7_Wcb9mbn0uBg8926sQQoWn5Qq1o8YuE-tu1Ng&s=r). Yep, formula milk in the US is double the price in Europe. No imports are possible. Yes, the FDA is responsible. No, this is not explained well by the mainstream press.

& [Two cheers for the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Bill](https://www.transparency.org.uk/queens-speech-2022-economic-crime-bill-money-laundering). To late, and not enough, but a start.
