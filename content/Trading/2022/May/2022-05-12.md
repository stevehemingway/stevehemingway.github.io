## The Hairy Caterpillar

Everyone thinks that there will be more hikes than we end up having.
We're all too keen to call the end of the 40-year  rally and sell bonds.
But ... maybe this time _is_ different.

Official expectations are frequently wrong. 
The path of short-term rates has repeatedly confounded the forecasters.
It's hard to make predictions, and these are definitely about the future, and are measurable.

## Tough times ahead for the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street

[Adam Posen writes that the UK is heading for stagflation.](https://www.ft.com/content/34eea151-ffae-4ae9-a5e9-85bac48d8a4c)
He has written this in the FT.
His argument is that inflation will take off because of international issues (particularly Brexit) but that 
no politically tolerable increase in interest rates will be sufficient to fix the imbalance in the supply of labour.
Posen has form: he's virulently anti-Brexit, but he has a point.
He states that as  a small, relatively open economy, we are in a much worse position than the USA.

For me, this signals that the pound will continue to decline. This will push up the price of everything,
including labour. 
Without a Thatcher-style recession, it's hard to see that inflation will be controlled.
