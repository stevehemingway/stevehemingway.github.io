# Covid and Trump and the US Presidential Election

The news has been totally dominated by these events.
Real market forces seem not to matter.

I listened to Kuppy on The Market Huddle.
He was waxing lyrical about $JOE (St. Joe Company). 
This is a small cap stock that has done nothing for a very long time,
but he sold the idea well.
I also think $TECK is worth another look, as well as $HCC.

I even think a range of thermal coal stocks ($HNRG, $ALRC, $BTU) might be worth considering. Cheap diversification is available via $KOL.
These stocks would be considered by most investors as close to a suicide trade, so you have been warned,
but just think about the 13.5% yield you can get on $KOL.
