# Markets today

The day started off fairly risk on.
I don't really know why.
Commodities are doing OK, stocks globally are rallying strongly.
Insiders, in the USA anyway, are not "buying the dip" unlike (it seems) the RobinHood crowd.

The long bond is down a bit, but a small reaction compared to stocks.
The USD (DX) is down, consistent with the risk-off tone.
