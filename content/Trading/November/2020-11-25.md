# Wrap

The US is barely at work today, with dealers thinking more about Turkey than TRL.

Overall, market is risk neutral:

- Bitcoin flat,
- Most other currencies likewise,
- SPX totally flat,
- Energy down, but after a steep rally yesterday, other sectors flat, small upticks for value sectors,
- Treasuries flat,
- Nat. Gas up 3.2%, oil up 1.9%, gold flat,
- very little market news. Salesforce ($CRM) may buy Slack ($WORK). $CRM will be the next $GE.

US readers: enjoy your Thanksgiving dinner!
