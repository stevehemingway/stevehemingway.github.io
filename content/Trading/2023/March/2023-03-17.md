# Oil price could hit $107/barrel by end 2023!

Read all about it, [here](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/oil-prices-could-hit-107-by-year-end-if-opec-stands-firm.html?chl=em&plt=briefings&cid=310&plc=body).
Normally, I'd be delighted to read a piece of research like this, but this note comes from Goldmans.
Don't get me wrong, Goldmans employs some bright people.
Commodities are complex, and oil is the most complex of all, because not only is it a tradeable commodity, it's highly politicized.
Obviously, in recent times the sanctions against Russia have been covered in a lot of detail, but historically, since the first world war at least, oil has been more than just a source of energy. It has been a source of military dominance.

One part of me wants to believe that for a system as complex as the global economy, attempting to forecast rates out beyond a couple of months is essentially impossible. Keynes talked somewhere about the folly of trying to predict what interest rates would be in twenty years.

He did have something to say about productivity growth over decades-long timescales, so he was not opposed to looking into the future. 
Maybe he just didn't want to forecast the value of a variable that is the outturn of so many opposing forces (generically, the supply and demand of funds for lending). 

Anyway, although I'm obsessively interested in what will happen to the price of oil, and I am -- deep in my heart -- a bull, I find it hard to believe that the price of oil would go up by around 30% in the course of three quarters when the world economy may quite possibly fall into a deep recession, with a consequential jump in the value of the dollar (the denominator in the price of oil). 

Over the longer term,  to me it seems implausible that the price of oil should not go up. Even if the marginal energy commodity is wind power (or solar), these are likely to be considerably higher than today's oil price (around $76/barrel), this will still drive up the price of oil. However, commodity prices move in mysterious ways, and anyone who thinks that the price of a basket of commodities should slavishly follow any broad inflation index has been very wrong for a long time.
