# Did the NSA create Bitcoin?

Here's something you might think is just a conspiracy theory.
[Maybe ...](https://hive.blog/bitcoin/@globalresearch/evidence-points-to-bitcoin-being-an-nsa-engineered-psyop-to-roll-out-one-world-digital-currency?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)

Still anonymous.
Still not cashed out.
Still the only bit of blockchain tech that anyone thinks works properly.
Still the phenomenon that CBs can use to support the argument that a digital currency is
viable and scalable.

OK, it's a conspiracy theory, but you have to admit that it's an interesting one.

While I'm on conspiracy theories, [this](http://www.deepthroatipo.com/how-to-wreck-a-big-old-gsib-bank/) is a post on how China may be planning to blow up 
the USA's bulge-bracket banks.
