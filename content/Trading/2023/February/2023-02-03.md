## Wrap for Jan
The new year has started with a bang.
Most risk assets are up a lot:
- SPX +6.3%,
- FAANG +18.7% (in spite of crap earnings),
- STOXX 60 +6.8%,
- USTs +2.8%,
- Other sovereign bonds (e.g. gilts +2.8%),
- Industrial metals (Cu +10.9%),
- EM everything (equities, bonds and FX),
- Crypto (not a real asset, but BTC up 38.8% nevertheless).
Most of these changes were given a tailwind by the DXY (dollar index)
being down again, by 1.4%, back to ~102.

However, it's not all good. Energy has had a dismal start, 
in spite of being priced in dollars. Natty (natural gas) was murdered (down 40% near-month futures), and oil (WTI futures, near-month) was down 1.7%. Note that oil is still in a stiff backwardation, indicating continued supply shortages. However, I find it hard to believe
that eight years out oil will still be trading at around $50 _in 2031 dollars._

Anyway, that's it from me. I will be away for a couple of weeks, 
so updates will be sporadic and probably holiday themed. 
I may post some nice pictures.
