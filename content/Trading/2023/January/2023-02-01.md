[UK records lowest-ever score in Corruption Perceptions Index.](https://www.transparency.org.uk/uk-corruption-perceptions-index-2022-score-CPI)
This is perhaps unsurprising.
[The raw stats](https://www.transparency.org.uk/corruption-statistics) are pretty depressing: 

- £100 billion of dirty money passes through UK systems and services every year.[[i]](https://www.transparency.org.uk/corruption-statistics#_edn1)

- **87,000 land titles** in England and Wales are owned by opaque corporate structures that hide the true owners.[[ii]](https://www.transparency.org.uk/corruption-statistics#_edn2)

- 76% think wealthy individuals often use their influence on Government for their own interests.[[iii]](https://www.transparency.org.uk/corruption-statistics#_edn3)

- Just **52 people** made a sixth of all declared UK political donations between 2001 and 2016.[[iv]](https://www.transparency.org.uk/corruption-statistics#_edn4)

- **£1.27 billion** is lost annually to fraud, bribery and corruption in the NHS.[[v]](https://www.transparency.org.uk/corruption-statistics#_edn5)
