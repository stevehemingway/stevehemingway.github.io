Adam Smith divided value into wages, profits and _rent_.
Rent was the income derived from that factor of production whose supply was
perfectly inelastic, the return to the _rentier_, which comprises 
an income derived from the scarcity of land, of which there is a fixed
amount in the world. 

Profits are the income which derives from the use of capital, such as a ship
or a factory. Capital can be produced, but at the cost of (current) consumption.
So, profits are the reward for deferred consumption. 

Wages are the return to labour. 
In some sense, labour is like capital: people even speak of 'human capital', but
the supply of it does not respond to the price in the same way that physical capital does.

Economics is a complex subject, and I am not an economist, but I wanted to state a 
few definitions, rather than just dive in and use jargon words which have meanings
which are different to those used in ordinary English.

Keynes tended to write about labour as a homogenous resource. He did make some acknowledgement
of some workers being able to command a higher wage than others, but he implicitly (maybe explicitly:
it's a long time since I read 'The General Theory') hand-waved that away, saying that
as long as the relative wages, and the relative proportions of workers with the various skills, 
remained constant, this did not invalidate his theory.
