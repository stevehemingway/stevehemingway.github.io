## Blair's legacy

It's the 20th anniversary of the Second Gulf War.
There are numbers of reports of Keir Starmer soliciting advice from Tony Blair (e.g. [here](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/keir-starmer-taking-advice-blair-28532880)).
Listening to [this podcast](https://www.politico.eu/podcast/meet-rachel-reeves-britains-next-chancellor/), it's clear that Rachel Reeves is a huge fan of
the last Labour leader to win a UK general election.

To me, Tony Blair is the reason that the UK electorate have voted Conservatives, whether they were lead by David Cameron or Theresa May or Boris Johnson.
Voters who are naturally on the right think they might as well vote for the real thing, rather than an ersatz version.
Voters who would 'normally' vote Labour don't want to vote for a party that has been in the middle of a civil war ever since they last left office.
They either want Corbyn but are afraid that there will be an internal coup and they'll be left with a 'Red Tory' party, or 
they actually want someone like Tony Blair but are afraid that if they vote Labour they'll end up with Momentum.

Blair, unlike most former leaders, seems to have turned into some sort of ghoul, forever attempting to earn more money from oligarchs and despots.
He has turned into some sort of spirit, condemned to circle the globe, endlessly, in his private jet, fixing things for evil corporates and 
murderous dictators. 

Voters notice that ever since the 1980s there has been endlessly increasing inequality, and stagnant real median incomes,
as well as 'forever wars' in which British soldiers, overwhelmingly from poor families, continue to die.

Blair has even been accused of being responsible for the rise of the Scottish Nationalist Party and the concommitent fall of Labour in Scotland, which is in some narrow sense is true, as Blair introduced the devolution that brought the Scottish Parliament into existence. 

Although 'First Past the Post' has failed to produce large majorities consistently, and has given disproportionate power to fringe parties, 
such as the DUP under Theresa May, it has ensured the dominance of a two-party system. This suits both Labour and the Conservatives, 
but does not lead to good policy decisions, and leaves voters increasingly disillusioned and disaffected.
