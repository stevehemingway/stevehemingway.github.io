# How to Improve Your Home Workspace Without Robbing the Piggy Bank

With so many people working from home nowadays, it has become common
practice to think of ways to upgrade a workspace without spending too
much - assuming you're thrifty at heart. Here are some tips on how to
cut down on your expenditure in this regard, presented to you below [[by
Wishful Thinking]{.underline}](https://www.stevehemingway.com/).

## Finding the ideal space  {#finding-the-ideal-space}

If your current home lacks the proper facilities for a workspace, then
you may need to find something more accommodating. Exploring online
listings should indicate what\'s available regarding how big of a space
you require to be able to work remotely - comfortably.

## Where to work?

If moving out of your current home is not an option, it would be in your
best interest to find an existing area to work in peace and quiet.
HomeServe notes that [[the bedroom is a popular
choice]{.underline}](https://www.homeserve.com/en-us/blog/how-to/home-office-ideas/)
because it is usually quiet and private during the daytime hours, making
it an ideal place to set up a desk and workstation for those who prefer
to work there.

Wherever you decide to work, you should give some serious
[[consideration to the budget you have
available]{.underline}](https://blog.fads.co.uk/inspiration/build-your-home-office-for-less-than-500/)
and the design you have in mind for your home office. Keep in mind that
such home [[improvements and
updates]{.underline}](https://www.redfin.com/guides/how-to-increase-your-home-appraisal-value-now)
can pay off in time as your property value will certainly get a nice
boost.

## Boost efficiency

With a few tweaks, you can be just as productive in a home office as you
would in a traditional office. Fenesta points out that [[exposure to
natural
light]{.underline}](https://www.fenesta.com/blog/importance-of-having-light-in-your-home-office)
can keep you more alert - and you can save on your monthly energy costs.
If you\'re looking for a change, consider painting the room or at least
the walls around your workspace a shade of green for a calming effect on
the psyche.

You can get a similar [[effect from having
plants]{.underline}](https://www.ambius.co.uk/benefits-of-indoor-plants/)
around the office, and they\'ll even help you breathe better.
Complementary lighting can help to enhance the ambiance of your homework
space should clients come around. Your decor is really up to you at the
end of the day and should be according to your personal taste.

[[A work
chair]{.underline}](https://www.tbsg.co.uk/blog/benefits-of-ergonomic-office-furniture-p6zd5)
that is either too soft or too rigid can be a major source of pain and
inefficiency in the workplace. The initial investment in a high-quality
chair may be larger, but it will serve you well for many years by
providing the necessary lumbar support at work. Other types of furniture
that you might find to be useful in your workspace could include a
sturdy desk, a desk lamp, a sofa for when clients come around, elegant
mirrors, additional lampstands, and a coffee table.

However, expenses like these can tend to add up. [[Click here for more

committing to a significant purchase.

As you can see, there are many ways to set up a functional workplace
without breaking the bank. Looking at rental options might just spark an
idea to find bigger premises and could be an option if you don't want to
waste time upgrading an area that might not end up working to your
advantage anyway.
