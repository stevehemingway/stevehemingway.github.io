Everyone enjoyed himself at the wonderful concert laid on by Knebworth Community Chorus this Saturday. The Village Hall was full to bursting, and many mince pies were consumed. A fair volume of mulled wine was drunk too.
The children of St Michael's,  Woolmer Green School put on a wonderful performance of singing and playing their instruments: violins and flutes.
Merry Christmas!
Steve.
