> This is the text of Livermore's book "How to trade in Stocks." I found a very badly OCR'd version on the Interweb, and spend a few hours reading and correcting the text. It probably still has the odd typo, but it's in a lot better shape now. Email me with comments.

This book was written in 1940. I don't know for sure, but I assume it's now out of copyright. If I'm wrong, tell me and I'll remove it.
