title: Oil gets lively

## Oil
Oil prices have been trending down for half a year.
Given the number of times that 'high energy prices' have been used as an
excuse for things getting more expensive, you may be surprised to read this, but it's true!

All the factors that made oil expensive before are still around.
Russia is still bombing Ukraine.
The world is waking up into a world where covid is endemic.
Even China has given up on the idea that it can be contained.
Oil companies are very reluctant to commit to large-scale capital expenditures 
because, yanno, windfall taxes (which crimps supply).
The world is running out of oilfields which are vaguely 
economic with oil at $70 a barrel.
There are widespread mumblings that the Fed is libering up for a 180 degree
pivot.

So far, the charts are not convincing. We have had four false dawns 
since the Autumn. Today may be nothing more serious.

## Steepeners
I know I wrote about the general move towards a more normal shaped
yield curve, which seems never to come.
Going to shorter maturities than Treasuries, I think it's worth
looking at Eurodollar futures, which are just forward 3M LIBOR 
futures. 
The near-end steepening view can be expressed by buying a fairly 
near-dated future (e.g. Dec 23) and selling a longer-dated one (e.g. Dec 24) 
as a calendar spread.
This is a faily cheap way of expressing such a view, and, seems quite 
tolerated by Interactive Brokers, in the sense of not requiring much in the way
of additional margin. 
Futures are dangerous things and the last thing I'd want to do would be to 
advise you to trade them. 
I guess an exception could be made if you really understood how to trade them,
but if you did you'd be ignoring this sentence and the one before it.

Have a great weekend!
