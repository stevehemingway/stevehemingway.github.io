# **NOVEMBER UPDATE**

## NHDC Noise Application

NHDC has introduced a Noise App to help deal with noise nuisance

North Hertfordshire District Council is using new technology to help deal with noise nuisance and has introduced a new Noise App. The app created by RH Environmental, allows residents with mobile devices to record incidents of nuisance noise and submit them to NHDC via the app. As unwanted noise is captured when it is actually happening, this makes it easier for residents to report problems and will allow the Council to more effectively investigate noise nuisance cases. Recorded audio files, which are sent securely, can also be shared with the Police and other agencies when tackling cases of anti-social behaviour.

The app can be downloaded free from the NHDC website: <http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/environmental-health/pollution/noise-app>

## NHDC Schedule of Meetings

The schedule of meetings for North Hertfordshire District Council is available on NHDC’s website: <http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/council-and-democracy> Agendas are posted ahead of the meetings and while some items, such as the Budget process, follow an annual cycle, other topics are ad hoc – the Planning Control committee is a good example where individual applications that have been “called in” to the committee are discussed. The meetings are held at NHDC’s offices in Gernon Road, Letchworth, SG6 3JF and are open for members of the public to observe; this includes the meetings of the Council’s Cabinet.

Approval has been granted to purchase equipment which will allow council and committee meetings to be recorded and made available on the web as podcasts.
