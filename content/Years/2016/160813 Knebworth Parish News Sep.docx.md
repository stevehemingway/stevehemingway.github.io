# NHDC Draft Local Plan 


**Update on Process:** Last month I highlighted the extraordinary
meeting of the Council to endorse the proposed emerging (or draft) Local
Plan. It was the only topic on the agenda and the meeting heard public
participation from a number of groups, almost exclusively speaking
against the proposals. The council heard a presentation from the
Executive Member for Planning, and then a prolonged debate involving
most of the council. The resolution to endorse the draft plan was
supported by 32 votes, with 12 voting against or abstaining (which
included me).


**Implications of Local Plan for Knebworth:** There are several sites
proposed for Knebworth, one in the centre of the village and the rest
for removal from the Green Belt, with dwelling estimates (area based
rule of thumb, not developer proposal) totalling 791, as follows:

A map of the sites is available, and you can find out more by searching
for “draft emerging allocations Knebworth”, with information on the
Parish Council and NHDC websites. The full detail of the Emerging Local
Plan may be obtained from:
www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/planning/planning-policy/emerging-local-plan


**Next Steps and Timings:** The next step is for a final decision by the
NHDC Cabinet to submit the plan for public consultation which, in this
context, is collecting responses for review by the Planning Inspector,
on behalf of the Secretary of State.


The decision by Cabinet will be taken at a meeting in September, so that
the statutory period of 6 weeks for the consultation will begin sometime
around mid October, so there is time to examine the proposals so that
you are ready to submit any comments once the consultation begins.


Note that, if you submitted comments in response to previous
consultations on the plan, such as the Preferred Options consultation in
December 2014, and believe that the updated plan does not fully address
your concerns, you should submit your comments again in October. This
time the comments will be examined by the Planning Inspector, on behalf
of the Secretary of State, and not by the planning officers in NHDC, as
part of his review of the whole plan. It is expected that formal
submission to the Planning Inspector will happen in the first part of
2017 and approval of the plan will be some time after that, possibly not
until 2018.


# Joint Waste Collection and Street Cleaning Contract


A contract for waste collection and street cleansing in the District is
not the most exciting topic imaginable. However, it does account for
around 45% of all North Herts District expenditure, so getting it wrong
could have catastrophic consequences for the Council budget. It has been
decided to go out to tender jointly with East Herts as by doing this
there will be an elimination of duplication in management of the
contract and should result in a reduction in unit costs. Before we can
do this the contract specifications for North and East Herts have to be
brought into line: not least the termination date of our current
contracts, but also in some detailed aspects of waste and recycling. To
let the contract will therefore take quite some time, but the decision
has now been made to move forward with the tender process.
