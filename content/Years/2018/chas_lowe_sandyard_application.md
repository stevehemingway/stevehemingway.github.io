Yesterday I spoke at [a Planning Control Committee meeting](http://web.north-herts.gov.uk/aksnherts/users/public/admin/kab14.pl?operation=SUBMIT&meet=135&cmte=PCC&grpid=public&arc=71). I was supporting the Parish Council, in the form of Cllr Roger Willcocks, in objecting to application, '17/02652/1 - 135A LONDON ROAD, KNEBWORTH, SG3 6EX'. This is the conversion of the old aggregates yard, part of Chas Lowe & Sons, into two 2-bed flats and two commercial (retail) units. The grounds on which we objected were principally to do with parking.
Although we did our best to convince the committee to refuse permission, only two members agreed with us. The minimum parking standards had not been met, but the committee accepted that the location justified relaxing the standard. The full argument, as well as the text of the Parish Council objection, can be read in [the report of the Planning officer](http://web.north-herts.gov.uk/aksnherts/images/att13450.docx).
In a case like this, where the vote goes the 'wrong' way, my view is that the time has not been wasted as the committee's attention is drawn to the desperately bad parking situation in the village, and may be less inclined to grant another similar application, having, perhaps, more appreciation of the severe cumulative impact of so many high-density developments going on in Knebworth.
Full details of the application can be read on [the NHDC Planning Portal](https://pa2.north-herts.gov.uk/online-applications/). Just search for the reference number on the application (in this case '17/02652/1').
