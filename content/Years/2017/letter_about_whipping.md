The following letter appeared in the various North Herts editions of today's Comet newspaper.

>Dear Sir,
>
>In response to the 'anonymous' (why?) correspondent who stated that the
>Conservative Group has adopted rules regarding voting. I am sure they are
>aware that all Parties, including the Liberal Democrats, have rules in place
>that require members to support agreed Party positions. They are completely
>incorrect in saying that anyone voting "in support of their residents" will
>be immediately subject to a three month suspension. In fact, local
>Conservative Party rules contain provisions allowing members to vote against
>or abstain on the agreed Party position when the matter specifically affects
>their ward or is a matter of conscience. An examination of the recorded vote
>on the Local Plan in September will confirm that there were several
>Conservative members who did not support the proposals at that time.
>The North Herts Conservative Party’s agreed position continues to be that
>this Plan should be supported, as a whole, as this is the only way in which
>we can protect our District from completely unchecked development. The Party
>Whip works closely with all Conservative members who may wish to abstain or
>vote against that position to ensure their reasons continue to fall within
>the rules of the Party. An approach not dissimilar to Liberal Democrat and
>Labour Party led authorities.
>
>A perhaps more interesting question is exactly what detailed research your
>correspondent has done in believing that the 'wishes of the residents' are
>to vote against the Local Plan? There are approximately 131,000 residents in
>North Hertfordshire and we have received 5,675 representations on the Local
>Plan. Similarly, your correspondent focuses only on the 'residents who voted
>him/her in as a councillor'. North Herts Conservatives work for every single
>resident in North Hertfordshire, not just the approximately  75% that vote
>or the ~1% who object, but the 100% who will be affected by unrestricted and
>unchecked housing development.
>
>--
