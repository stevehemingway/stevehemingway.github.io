Following the meeting and resolutions of Full Council on 11 April 2017, the new Local Plan for North Hertfordshire has now been submitted to the Secretary of State for examination.
 
The Planning Inspectorate have advised the Council that Inspector Simon Berkeley BA MA MRTPI has been appointed to conduct the examination. The precise date for the opening of any formal hearing part of the examination into the Local Plan will be decided by the Inspector.
 
Louise St John Howe has been appointed as the Programme Officer for the duration of the examination. The Programme Officer is the independent ‘go between’ who liaises between the Inspector, the Council and the respondents to the plan. The Programme Officer will shortly write to everyone who responded to the last consultation on the Local Plan to advise them of the above and provide further details.
 
Any queries regarding the administration of the examination or any correspondence for the attention of the Inspector should be sent via Louise:
