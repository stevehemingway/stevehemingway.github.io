<h2>Unemployment and&nbsp;inflation</h2>
<div class="embed-container"><iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=Zi9o&width=670&height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"></iframe></div>

<p>I wanted to write about the Phillips Curve, and put together this chart to illustrate it.
The post will have to wait, but I&#8217;ll leave the chart.
It might not display properly: I don&#8217;t normally embed scripts into&nbsp;posts.</p>
<h2>Weekly&nbsp;wrap</h2>
<p><span class="caps">USD</span> up against almost everything, except <span class="caps">AUD</span>.</p>
<h3>Equities</h3>
<p>Equities were up on the week, with the exception of a few defensive sectors,
especially healthcare.
The standout performance was $<span class="caps">TSLA</span>, up 33% on the week, but after a long
downtrend.
Semiconductors were up, except $<span class="caps">INTC</span>, which everyone seems to have
lost faith&nbsp;in.</p>
<p><span class="caps">IT</span> generally was up, except $<span class="caps">ACN</span> (Accenture, which I don&#8217;t even think
belongs in the sector) and $<span class="caps">IBM</span> (which nobody has liked for a couple
of&nbsp;decades). </p>
<p>Energy stocks were not very lively, even $<span class="caps">CVX</span> showed a small loss on the week,
in spite of good&nbsp;results.</p>
<h3>Bond and Fixed&nbsp;Interest</h3>
<p>Yields were up across the board, almost, reversing recent performance.
Supposedly, this means that the chances of recession(s) are decreasing, 
which is consistent with equity results, but I feel this may be a false
dawn.
The <span class="caps">UK</span> was an outlier, with yields down, in the slightly odd club of developed
countries, which include Romania and Poland in Europe and a few more
outside of Europe, including Zambia, whose yield has come down by 34bp,
but only to 30.2%. Let&#8217;s hope that <span class="caps">UK</span> gilt yields are not heading to 
those elevated&nbsp;heights.</p>
<h3><span class="caps">FX</span>&nbsp;Markets</h3>
<p>Generally, the dollar continues to sag.
Apart from a few basket-case countries (such as Pakistan),
the milkshake has curdled badly.
This is all of a piece with equities and bonds: the 
narrative is that the Fed will start to &#8216;normalize.&#8217;
The curve is still inverted, and increasingly so, both 2/10s and 
over the first two years of the eurodollar&nbsp;markets.</p>
<h2>Commodities</h2>
<p>Generally, equity and precious metal commodities had a soggy week,
in spite of the weakening dollar. Energy wobbled around $80/bbl (<span class="caps">WTI</span> futures),
really not much higher than it was towards the end of 2018.
The pundits keep predicting that the &#8216;reflation&#8217;/&#8217;reopening&#8217; trade will turbocharge
oil, but if markets are forward looking, and discount all available information, 
then something is amiss. Maybe the fabled &#8216;soft landing&#8217; will turn out to be&nbsp;bone-crushing.</p>
<p>Something is amiss with the price of &#8216;<span class="caps">EV</span> minerals too.&#8217; As <a href="https://bfrandall.substack.com/p/another-mining-truth-bomb-from-john?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=1140581&amp;post_id=98274231&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;utm_medium=email">this post</a> points out,
the quantity of ore, and overburden, required to be dug to make a modern <span class="caps">EV</span> is extraordinary.
The pro-<span class="caps">EV</span> crowd always argue that &#8216;over time technologies get better and more efficient.&#8217;
Well, this is true, but in a century and a half of oil extraction, the cost of a barrel hasn&#8217;t dropped dramatically. 
It&#8217;s one thing for microprocessors to get better, it&#8217;s quite another for physical commodities
to suddenly fall in price. 
No technological breakthrough is going to revolutionize the extraction of cobalt, nickel, graphite, lithium and copper. It&#8217;s going to be a long, hard grind (in a giant ball&nbsp;mill).</p>
<p>I want to get away from whether this mining is a good thing or a bad thing. 
I want to know if it&#8217;s going to happen or not. 
At the moment it looks like a standoff between the irresistible force of political consensus
against the immovable object of unaffordable economics. I am a betting man, but I don&#8217;t think I have any edge in forecasting the winner of this epic struggle.
The economist in me wants to predict that the hopes of a green revolution will be
dashed on the rocks of bad economics, but governments increasingly specialize in 
passing laws which make us poorer. It&#8217;s not clear that this case will be any&nbsp;different.</p>
