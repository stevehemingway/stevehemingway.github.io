</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>The deflationary trend continues: bonds were up, the 10Y stands at 1.56%.
The <span class="caps">NDX</span> was up 1.5%, other markets less, but consistent with a deflationary trend.
New jobs created were fewer than expected, but unemployment decreased more. 
Hourly wages increased 0.5% MoM, more than the 0.2% expected.
I am not sure whether this adds up to very much, other than that the economy is still in recovery&nbsp;mode.</p>
<p>Crude was up, <span class="caps">DXY</span> was down. The Turkish Lira continues a very slow drift down against the euro.
Gold recovered some of its recent losses.
<span class="caps">GSCI</span> was up about&nbsp;1%.</p>
<h2>Carried&nbsp;Interest</h2>
<p>Carried interest is one of those many things which exist purely because they are a form of tax arbitrage.
By taking the <span class="caps">NPV</span> of a stream of performance-related fees and taking the sum as a stake in a the assets of a fund, what would ordinarily be treated as income becomes transformed into capital gains.
Because the tax system taxes cash flows differently according to when they are received, classifying them into &#8220;income&#8221; and &#8220;capital gains&#8221; this results in a considerable tax saving for the managers.
The practice was strongly defended in the letters page of the <span class="caps">FT</span> today, responding to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e9fae12d-17bc-47e3-80ad-b52d7e58fd2e">a report that Scottish Widows has called for this arrangement to be scrapped</a>. 
What everyone misses is the dysfunctional design of the tax system that gives rise to this (arguably) artificial&nbsp;arrangement.</p>
