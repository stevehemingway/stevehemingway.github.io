<p><a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/14/it-starts-mortgage-delinquencies-suddenly-soar-at-record-pace/"><span class="caps">US</span> mortgage arrears are spiking</a>. Not really a surprise, but Wolf gives the details. Headlines can be misleading, as mortgages in forebearance are not&nbsp;counted.</p>
<p>Silver seems to be breaking out. 
I don&#8217;t really know why, but it seems a thing.
I somehow feel it&#8217;s linked to weaking dollar, but I may be totally&nbsp;wrong.</p>
<h2>Market&nbsp;News</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.verdict.co.uk/retail-banker-international/news/china-to-bar-large-withdrawals-following-surge-in-bank-runs/">China to bar large withdrawals following surge in bank runs</a>: this article was followed up <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-14/spate-of-china-bank-runs-force-police-regulators-to-act">by Bloomberg</a> somewhat later. 
The <span class="caps">FT</span> does not seem to have picked up on this story, but it surely is important. 
I have been waiting for the cracks to appear the Chinese rally. 
The whole system is rotten: totalitarian regimes rarely have strong stock markets. 
The only thing to worry about is whether the PBoC will allow the <span class="caps">RMB</span> will slide to save the stockmarket.
I&#8217;m sure that Xi Jinping and his cronies are very busy right now shipping their wealth out of China.
There is the usual Twitter noise about <em>this</em> week being the one where the $<span class="caps">SPX</span> drops 10-12%. It&#8217;s hard to see it happening, but the <span class="caps">FAANGMAN</span> (<span class="caps">FAANG</span> + $<span class="caps">MSFT</span>, $<span class="caps">NVDA</span>, $<span class="caps">AMD</span>) have got way out of whack with the rest of the index. A reversal trade (long RoI, short <span class="caps">FAANGMAN</span>) might be worth a bob each way, but it&#8217;s hard to&nbsp;structure.</p>
<p>I keep thinking that a vertical calendar spread (I think that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s called: diff. strikes <span class="amp">&amp;</span> expiries, short puts) on some of the <span class="caps">FAANG</span> stocks might be worth a punt too. But, please don&#8217;t try this at home (I have to think a lot more about the payoff profile before I try&nbsp;it).</p>
<h2>Analyst&nbsp;Ratings</h2>
<p>Sell side analysts are in a difficult position.
Their employers earn income from the buy-side actually, y&#8217;know, buying stuff.
So, they rarely rate a stock a sell. Almost the worst they can do is to make the stock a &#8220;hold.&#8221;
(Well, they wouldn&#8217;t want fund managers who bought on an earlier recommendation to feel cheated!)
I get emails telling me about changes in analyst ratings. The delta probably says more than the level.
The following stocks have at least one &#8220;Sell&#8221; recommendation: $<span class="caps">GSX</span>, $<span class="caps">HSBA</span>, $<span class="caps">RCL</span>, $W. 
The following have at least one &#8220;Underperform:&#8221; $<span class="caps">HSBA</span> (actually, 11 of them!), $<span class="caps">RCL</span>, $W.
$<span class="caps">MRNA</span> got a pile of new &#8220;Buys,&#8221; just as the insiders are dumping their stock. 
It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what&nbsp;happens.</p>
