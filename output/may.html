</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h1>Review of my first year at <span class="caps">NHDC</span></h1>
<p>By the time you read this column I will have served as a member of <span class="caps">NHDC</span>
in the Knebworth Ward for (nearly) a whole year. It has been an eventful
one for matters that concern the District Council: a number of planning
applications for major brownfield developments, two solar farm
applications, the introduction of Knebworth&#8217;s first Controlled Parking
Zone and the planned move of the <span class="caps">GP</span> Surgery.
Of course the biggest issue of all is the ongoing, and &#8216;emerging&#8217; Local
Plan, which will continue emerging for a considerable time before it is
adopted. The current timetable envisages that this will happen in April
2017, two years&#8217; from now, but the probability that this timetable will
slip must be significant, in the light of the rate of progress so far.
I have done my best to represent the interests of all the residents of
the ward so far, and will continue to do so over the course of the next
civic year. I hope that my considerably increased experience of being a
District councillor will enable me to be no less effective than over the
previous twelve months, and hopefully a little bit more effective.
A large number of you have taken the opportunity to contact me, via
telephone, email and letter and I can assure you that I read every
communication personally, even if occasionally I may not have time to
send an individual response. There are, inevitably, many problems that
are not amenable to any easy solutions. A considerable part of my
postbag is connected to issues around road safety and parking. To this
end I am working towards re-starting the Knebworth Parking Initiative
Group in the coming year, a forum in which representatives from
Knebworwth village can have a dialogue with representatives of <span class="caps">NHDC</span>.
As many residents of Knebworth pointed out during the consultation on
the Local Plan, it is important that jobs are created locally if we are
to avoid having a community in which there is a good balance of local
employment and London commuters. <span class="caps">NHDC</span> is aware of the importance of
local economic activity and is looking for feedback on its Draft
Economic Development Strategy – ‘Productive North Herts’. This policy
aims to address issues related to growing new and existing businesses
across the District. The feedback from the consultation will form a
final strategy and action plan to help the economy grow and generate
employment opportunities locally. A draft Economic Development Strategy
has been published and feedback is encouraged via the Consultations area
of the <span class="caps">NHDC</span> website, or by post to Economic Development, North
Hertfordshire District Council, <span class="caps">PO</span> Box 480, Sale, M33 <span class="caps">0DE</span>.</p>
