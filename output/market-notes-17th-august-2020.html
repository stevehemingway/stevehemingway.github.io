<p>Seems like the main thing happening today is that <a href="https://www.forexlive.com/news/%21/usdjpy-falls-below-10600-as-dollar-weakness-extends-20200817">the dollar is starting to feel the impact of central bank money printing</a>.
Commodities are up, across the board,
equities are up (well, it would take a huge meteor strike on <span class="caps">NYC</span> to affect that),
<em>and bonds are up too</em>.
The risk-on/risk-off narrative does not apply, although the <span class="caps">VIX</span> continues to get crushed under the weight of&nbsp;money.</p>
<p>In general news, there is a big row over using the <span class="caps">US</span> postal service for voting by mail in the presidential election in Nov.,
China is injecting a lot of stimulus into its economy,
Japan is looking very sick (which has pushed up its currency, explained by interest rate parity, maybe).
South-east Asia is in a parlous state.
Open economies dependent on manufacturing and tourism are not going to do well in a time of&nbsp;Covid.</p>
<h2>Close</h2>
<p>Market action from this morning continued.
$<span class="caps">TSLA</span> jumped a ludicrous 11% to $1835.
Fraud stocks ($<span class="caps">NIO</span>, $<span class="caps">NKLA</span> and $<span class="caps">TSLA</span>) account for 30% of total automotive market cap.
There will be a price to pay, but not today and almost certainly not&nbsp;tomorrow.</p>
<p>Gold was up 2.25%. <span class="caps">VIX</span> futures were down&nbsp;5.4%.</p>
<p><a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/c3mlgLAUTG">This</a> looks important, but I don&#8217;t really understand it. Gamma is always highest for <span class="caps">ATM</span> options, so I don&#8217;t really get the significance of this.
There is a post <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/nomura-heres-what-fridays-gamma-unclenching-means-nasdaq">here</a> which explains what gamma clenching&nbsp;is.</p>
<p>My tentative understanding is that gamma tends to drag money into the index (the Nasdaq in this case). For a &#8216;normal&#8217; position in the index, via futures or passive funds, there is no need for whoever manages the <span class="caps">QQQ</span> <span class="caps">ETF</span> to actually execute any trades: the existing cash hedge is all that is needed. With a positive gamma position, this is not the case. To keep hedged, someone somewhere has to buy more in the cash market. But this cannot be the passive funds: they transact only in response to retail buying or selling. It has to be the active managers, who are an endangered species and have probably sold all their crazily over-valued Nasdaq stocks anyway. So the market&nbsp;goes</p>
<p>As money flows into the index, passive funds have no option other than to buy immediately (or get equivalent exposure via futures, but this will just force whoever is selling the futures to buy in the cash market to hedge <em>their</em> position). A positive gamma means that overall&nbsp;exposure</p>
