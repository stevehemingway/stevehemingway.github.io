<h2>Tweet</h2>

<h2>Inflation</h2>
<p>The media is going wild about current inflation, but the market is remarkably sanguine. In the <span class="caps">USA</span>, expectation are no higher now than they were in&nbsp;2018. </p>
<iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=Olbj&width=670&height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden; width:670px; height:525px;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"></iframe>

<p>In the <span class="caps">UK</span>, the forward expectations is fairly steeply downward sloping, with a kick in the&nbsp;tail.</p>
<p>https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/images/statistics/yield-curves/ukinf.gif?h=390&amp;la=en&amp;w=532&amp;hash=<span class="caps">C6F2803F5963F8DE2C5F9962F1B0DCB8064220F9</span></p>
<p>The markets are not always right, but they represent a money-weighted guess about the future. 
Maybe they are wrong this time, but inflation will not survive a severe&nbsp;downturn.</p>
<h2>The failure of monetary&nbsp;policy</h2>
<p>Monetary policy works by reducing real wages across the board so the labour market can clear, while allowing the market for capital to remain in equilibrium.
That&#8217;s my non-economist understanding of the&nbsp;policy.</p>
<p>The left likes using monetary policy, because it can work to reduce unemployment.
The right likes it because it keeps capital markets buoyant. 
The finance sector likes it because it has lead to a hyper-financialized economy in which the City is the most important sector in the <span class="caps">UK</span> economy, 
with a concomitant rise in political&nbsp;influence.</p>
<p>The problem is that monetary policy has run out of road. 
Interest rates are a very blunt tool. 
It&#8217;s possible to control inflation by jacking up rates, but only at the price of destroying the capital-intensive parts of the economy,
like housing and manufacturing.
When supply chains are stretched to breaking point, and most housing markets have not recovered since the 2008 crisis, this is not a great look.
The <span class="caps">UK</span> has chronically failed to build houses at a replacement rate, with the result that we have a housing stock which is epically unsuited to 
being insulated&nbsp;cost-effectively.</p>
<p>Allowing energy and food prices to rocket will have a deeply asymmetrical impact on voters.
The poor devote much more of their income to these items.
They do not have the luxury of going from luxury foods to &#8216;budget&#8217; ones.
They cannot afford £60,000 for a new <span class="caps">EV</span>.</p>
<p>The only solution is fiscal action. Messy, targeted, flawed fiscal measures, 
I don&#8217;t like it, and I&#8217;m sure Rishi doesn&#8217;t but the alternative is defeat at the ballot box.
The May local elections will give an indication of how ordinary people feel about&nbsp;inflation.</p>

<h2>The oil bull&nbsp;case</h2>
<p><a href="https://macro-ops.com/oil-markets-massive-repricing/">Macro Ops nailed this thesis back in 2017</a>.
I could kick myself for not having the courage of my convictions, but the basic thesis, that all the EVs in all the world are not going
to make a damn bit of difference to oil usage is&nbsp;correct.</p>
<p>Bison Interests, Kuppy, Pinecone Macro, have all been spot on about this, but until recently nobody really believed them.
Markets are driven by narratives.
We are still in the narrative of &#8216;<span class="caps">OK</span>, Russia is at war, and there is a transitory disruption to supplies of Russian oil but this will soon be finished and we can go back to ever-declining oil.&#8217; 
Maybe this thesis will win for a bit, but at some point the oil bears will capitulate.
Especially if governments the world over start subsidizing the price of oil products to consumers.
If the cure for high prices is high prices, then suppressing high prices is the way to prolong the&nbsp;disease.</p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>Many markets were closed today: Easter Monday. 
For those that were open, trends largely&nbsp;continued:</p>
<ul>
<li>bonds continued to be weighed down by inflation&nbsp;concerns, </li>
<li>the Yen was&nbsp;weak,</li>
<li>the dollar was&nbsp;strong,</li>
<li>equity markets were generally weak, with the exception of Europe and&nbsp;Brazil,</li>
<li>gas and oil went up, as did commodities generally, in spite of the dollar strength, as were Canadian gas producers such as Range Resources and&nbsp;Sandridge.</li>
<li>home construction ($<span class="caps">ITB</span>), a proxy for <span class="caps">US</span> real estate prices, was down. Housing is the biggest asset class of all, and 30 year mortgage rates in the <span class="caps">US</span> are up by ~40% (up to ~5% pa), which when combined with food and energy inflation draining spending power from the <span class="caps">US</span> consumer things are looking&nbsp;bad.</li>
