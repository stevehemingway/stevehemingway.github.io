</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h2>New Contract for Waste&nbsp;Collection</h2>
<p><span class="caps">NHDC</span> is progressing with the new contract for the household waste
collection service, jointly with East Herts. The winning bidder was a
company called Urbaser who, while new to North Herts are the third
largest environmental services provider across Europe. The contract for
basic waste collection has been agreed with a more minor part of the
contract to be signed. The contract represents a significant saving for
Council Tax payers. It is expected that most operatives will transfer
their employment from&nbsp;Veolia.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of discussion about the decision of the Council to
charge £40 per bin per year for garden waste collection from the 2018
civic year. Residents will be able to share a bin (and its cost) with a
neighbour when the volume of garden waste produced does not warrant
paying for a whole bin, and can also have more than one bin. The charge
for brown bin collection is not expected to fully offset the cost of
collection, but will help to reduce the serious revenue deficit <span class="caps">NHDC</span>
has, with savings of £4.2m per year targeted by&nbsp;2021/22.</p>
<p>Food waste will be collected from new, larger, caddies weekly: an
improvement in the level of service compared to today. Home composting
is a very green alternative to paying for brown bin collection. The
Hertfordshire WasteAware Partnership provides home compost bins to
Hertfordshire residents at subsidized prices. To order a compost bin
call 0844 571 4444 or visit

<h1><span class="caps">NHDC</span> Local Plan -&nbsp;Examination</h1>
<p>The Examination in
Public of the Local Plan started on the 13th November, the Inspector is
Simon Berkeley. The first couple of weeks focus on strategic matters,
such as the duty of <span class="caps">NHDC</span> to cooperate with adjoining authorities to take
housing that they themselves cannot deliver (this especially applies to
Luton), and then on the Countryside and Green Belt, the housing mix and
the spatial distribution of new housing. Evidence is on the
deliverability of the plan and the &#8216;high level&#8217; issues: i.e. without
any reference to individual sites or the allocations to&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>The allocations to individual sites will be examined in Week 6 of the enquiry, the sites around Knebworth specifically being examined on the morning of Monday 26th February. These sessions are all open to the public and are held in the Icknield Centre, Icknield Way in Letchworth. Full details are on <span class="caps">NHDC</span>&#8217;s&nbsp;website.</p>
<h1>Merry&nbsp;Christmas</h1>
