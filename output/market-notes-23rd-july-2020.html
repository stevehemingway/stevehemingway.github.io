<p>Mildly risk-on.
Dollar weaker.
Lots of articles talking about negative interest rates (<span class="caps">US</span>), 
precious metals breaking higher (especially silver).
Global equities generally higher, but Far East looks precarious.
I understand the arguments that the Fed cannot let the long end of the curve get out of control,
but I can&#8217;t help thinking that with all the funding needed by the Treasury that the <span class="caps">US</span> curve will steepen.
I think the same goes for the <span class="caps">UK</span> curve, but it&#8217;s harder to trade this: the short sterling contract seems moribund, 
and my rule of thumb estimate of the duration of 3-month sterling futures suggests that you need an awful lot of them to hedge out the base level interest rate risk.
Gold grinds higher, although silver is taking a breather after its recent sprint.
I suspect it&#8217;s a good time to buy miners that produce gold, silver and copper, but I don&#8217;t know enough about the individual stocks to risk&nbsp;it.</p>
<h2>More blah blah about Treasury General&nbsp;Account</h2>
<p>The <span class="caps">US</span> Treasury funds all government spending. It has a bank account, at the Fed, with the money it&#8217;s going to spend. It is issuing (Treasury) securities like a madman, and the balance in the General Account is going through the roof: $1.8 Trn. Currently, this is locked up in the bank, but real soon now it&#8217;ll be in the bank account of a banker near you. Will this light the flame of inflation? Or maybe just another leg up for the <span class="caps">NDX</span>? Who can tell?

<h2>Bubble&nbsp;Economy</h2>
<p><a href="https://thefelderreport.com/2020/07/22/if-that-was-a-bubble-whats-this/?mc_cid=f2b14a9e5e&amp;mc_eid=8d66df2c11">$<span class="caps">AAPL</span>, $<span class="caps">AMZN</span>, $<span class="caps">MSFT</span></a> are now trading at beyond-stratospheric valuations, which are totally nothing to do with money creation, as exemplified by <a href="https://koyfin.com/s/rTpH2vfSCQ">this chart</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear where the money is coming from to invest in stonks. The bit that is unclear is why it ends up inflating the price of a very small number of &#8220;high tech&#8221; stocks, such as the the <span class="caps">FAANG</span>++ and not other assets, like real estate, wine, oil stocks, transports. Yes, I know that value is not sexy,&nbsp;but  </p>
<h2>Whacky&nbsp;Wednesday</h2>
<p><a href="https://wallstreetonparade.com">Wall Street On Parade</a> is probably considered a fringe publication.
But it&#8217;s one of the better ones. <a href="https://wallstreetonparade.com/2020/07/warnings-of-fascism-in-america-grow/">This post</a> picks out some whackiness that really couldn&#8217;t be made up.
The Koch network is blamed. 
I tend to blame the alienation of most normal people from the political process, which allows actors like the Koch brothers to have a wildly disportionate influence on&nbsp;events.</p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>Major <span class="caps">UK</span> equity indexes down today (apart from <span class="caps">IWM</span> which was flat).
<span class="caps">UST</span> yields up (inconsistently) but only slightly.
Commodities mixed, though gold still up, silver down. 
Natural gas looks as though it may be headed up (5.7%), but it&#8217;s so volatile (well, it&#8217;s it has a molecular of sixteen, so what do you expect?) it&#8217;s probably better to steer clear of. <span class="caps">WTI</span> is down 1.5%. 
There is a theory that <span class="caps">NG</span> and <span class="caps">CL</span> prices move against one another, but I&#8217;ll leave that for another&nbsp;time.</p>
