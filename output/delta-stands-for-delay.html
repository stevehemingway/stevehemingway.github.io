<h2>Climate change and the class&nbsp;struggle</h2>
<p>The poor are different. They have less money. This means that action to combat climate change which results in essentials becoming more expensive hits them hardest.
For&nbsp;example:</p>
<ul>
<li>heating for houses, often&nbsp;draughty,</li>
<li>petrol, and diesel for older&nbsp;cars,</li>
<li>flights to&nbsp;Spain,</li>
<li>subsidies to landowners for set-aside, bio diesel, and&nbsp;&#8220;min-till,&#8221;</li>
<li>subsidies for solar&nbsp;panels, </li>
<li>subsidies for heat pumps and battery electric&nbsp;vehicles,</li>
<li>increase in transport costs for cheap Chinese manufactures, and&nbsp;textiles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Middle class people spend a lot of money on private education, land and big houses, posh cars and&nbsp;ponies. </p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen what has happened in France. When will the <em>gilets jaunes</em> cross the&nbsp;Channel?</p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>Things I noticed from <a href="https://dailyshotbrief.com/the-daily-shot-brief-july-20th-2021/"><em>The Daily Shot</em> today</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="caps">US</span> residents are no longer comfortable with buying, and more importantly, financing a house today (U&nbsp;Michigan), </li>
<li>However, housing demand is still strong (reluctant buyers with no alternatives and Blackrock,&nbsp;presumably),</li>
<li>Greensill Bank seems still to rank in the top ten <span class="caps">UK</span> &#8216;unicorns.&#8217; The list is headed by Revolut, which is ten times the value of Oxford Nanopore, which at least has some patented and valuable&nbsp;technology,</li>
<li>Funds have been flowing into Columbia&#8217;s local currency debt, while its economy takes a&nbsp;dive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Things I noticed in <em>The Market Ear</em>&nbsp;newsletter:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="caps">GS</span> are convinced that oil is heading&nbsp;higher,</li>
<li><span class="caps">BTC</span> is struggling to regain momentum, in spite of a general risk-on tone to the&nbsp;markets,</li>
<li>the &#8216;blackout&#8217; period for buybacks has ended and now is the season for CEOs of <span class="caps">SP500</span> companies to not spare the balance sheet in pursuit of their&nbsp;bonuses.</li>
<li>the Morgan Stanley Global Risk Demand Index is flashing green: it&#8217;s reading -2.13, which constitutes &#8216;extreme risk aversion&#8217;. I have no idea how this is computed, but it tends to reverse once it gets to these levels, leading to a strong rebound in risk&nbsp;appetite. </li>
<li>10Y yield is looking overstretched on the downside. At about 1.1%, it&#8217;s discounting something approaching deflation in the next ten years, which no serious macro forecaster is (<em>pace</em> Lacey Hunt). This has caused a real flattening in the&nbsp;curve.</li>
</ul>
<p>Breakevens, which go as the yield on Treasury bills less the yield on <span class="caps">TIPS</span>, have been falling. 
Presumably, this reflects two parts of the bond market not agreeing about the&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>The falling yields have hammered &#8216;short duration&#8217; stocks like <span class="caps">XOM</span>, relative to long duration stocks, such as&nbsp;Google.</p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>Basically, this was a bounce back from Monday&#8217;s swoon. 
Not based on any particular news, as far as I can tell.
Most markets bouncing back, especially oil and related commodities.
As far as I can tell, the volatility is all driven by nervousness about Covid variants. Well, maybe not so much the variants as the (over)reaction we can expect from nervous&nbsp;governments.</p>
