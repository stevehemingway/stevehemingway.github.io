<h2><span class="caps">EU</span> Inflation&nbsp;Update</h2>
<p>Expectations, aggregate demand above productive capacity, runaway growth in credit creation. There are many explanations of inflation, most of which seem to fail in one regime or&nbsp;another.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a very long time since anyone in fixed income markets in developed markets had any first hand experience of inflation, and how to trade in a bear&nbsp;market.</p>
<p>Inflation and weakening of the currency, and rising yields of government debt, often linked to a falling currency are often&nbsp;linked. </p>
<p>It sure is hard to come up with a reliable, quantitative model for inflation, so hats off to <a href="https://arkesresearch.substack.com/p/eu-inflation-update-013?utm_source=url">Arkes Research</a>
for coming up with one.
It forecasts 3.7% for 2022, vs 3.2% from the <span class="caps">ECB</span> economists.
How much faith to put in either of these numbers is impossible to say, 
but it seems clear that commodities are going to continue to&nbsp;rally.</p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>The <span class="caps">US</span> seems determined to force Germany to cancel Nord Stream 2. 
Russia will be subject to sanctions for what it has done so far.
Intelligence suggests that Russian troops will soon go into the disputed reasons, on the pretext of protecting Russian speakers from Ukrainian&nbsp;aggression.</p>
<p><span class="caps">FOMC</span> member Daly has said that he wants to see four rate hikes (100bp,&nbsp;presumably).</p>
<p>Ukraine has declared a state of&nbsp;emergency.</p>
<p>Nearly all equity markets have gone done.
Oddly, nearly all govt. bond prices have gone up (yields down).
Today, the safe-haven properties of bonds were outweighed by the inflation sensitivity.
Treasuries and some currencies (<span class="caps">AUD</span>.<span class="caps">JPY</span>) have started to have a risk-on behaviour which is not&nbsp;typical.</p>
<p>This is a day for being flat, which &#8212; after all &#8212; is a position&nbsp;too.</p>
<h2>Conspiracy&nbsp;Corner</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.thehighersidechats.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-the-real-anthony-fauci-aids-covid-the-medical-industrial-complex/">Robert F. Kennedy Jr. | The Real Anthony Fauci, <span class="caps">AIDS</span>, <span class="caps">COVID</span>, <span class="amp">&amp;</span> The Medical Industrial&nbsp;Complex</a></p>
<p>Big Pharma is a pretty toxic entity. The capture of regulators is endemic in most developed markets, but particularly in the <span class="caps">USA</span>.</p>
<p>I do not know if Fauci is guilty of what he is accused of doing, but this episode is worth listening to, if only to understand what all the Joe Rogan fans are on&nbsp;about.</p>
<p>The basis thesis is that Fauci allowed big pharma to corrupt the <span class="caps">CDC</span> and other medical regulators in a way that allowed them make big profits from inferior&nbsp;treatments.</p>
<p>I was unaware of the claims, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/dec/2/publisher-blasts-total-media-blackout-robert-kenne/">unsurprisingly</a>. Kennedy is mentioned in the <span class="caps">FT</span>, but only in stories about decisions to ban him.
For the avoidance of doubt, I think that the Covid vaccine is basically safe, but I think this book should be reviewed in the mainstream media&nbsp;too.</p>
