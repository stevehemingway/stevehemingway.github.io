<h1>The sheer insanity of the <span class="caps">US</span>&nbsp;budget</h1>
<p>Taps Coogan has pointed this out before, and I have no doubt he&#8217;ll poing it again, but <a href="https://thesoundingline.com/low-interest-rates-today-dont-reduce-the-governments-debt-servicing-cost-tomorrow/">the <span class="caps">US</span> can never raise enough taxes to pay off the national debt or, even to realistically reduce it</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>What we ‘need’ more than just inflation is interest rates that are lower than the inflation rate. i.e. negative real interest rates. However, negative real rates and rising nominal rates and rising inflation is the absolute worst scenario for the bond investors that are supposed to be financing the ever growing national debt. That mix represents a guaranteed loss of real wealth for bond holders. How are bond holders supposed to lend ever more money to the government while they are busy going&nbsp;broke?</p>
<p>For that reason, negative real interest rates don’t persist for long in a rising nominal rate environment without massive interventions by central banks. The <span class="caps">ECB</span> and Bank of Japan have had to buy virtually all debt issuance from their respective governments to enforce negative nominal rates and their bond investors haven’t had to worry about rising nominal yields, at least not until&nbsp;recently. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The BoJ has been monetizing the Japanese national debt for a long time, but it&#8217;s largely held by Japanese nationals (and so is &#8216;money we owe ourselves&#8217; in Krugman-speak). For the <span class="caps">USA</span>, it&#8217;s different. While China is getting a small nominal return on the debt, it will wear it, especially as it has largely succeeded in keeping its currency down relative to the dollar.
If the inflationary impact of <span class="caps">QE</span> starts to leak into the exchange rate, I am not sure how long China will want to continue financing helicopter money for <span class="caps">US</span>&nbsp;citizens.</p>
<p>Curiously, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/13/upshot/economy-optimism-boom.html">this article from the <span class="caps">NY</span> Times</a> sort of agrees that the budget is out of control but that the real economy will be fine because at last it will start to be allowed to run hot.
It&#8217;s true that the 40&#8217;s, 50&#8217;s and (early) 70&#8217;s had pretty good growth. A collapse in bond prices would act as a phenomenal transfer of real resources to young people in the <span class="caps">USA</span> and away from the old and Chinese (well, all holders of <span class="caps">US</span> long dated&nbsp;debt).</p>
<p>Allison Reichel  <a href="https://rationalreasoning.substack.com/p/is-the-economy-overheating?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTAyMDI1LCJwb3N0X2lkIjozMjg3NzExMSwiXyI6Ik5GZksrIiwiaWF0IjoxNjE1ODI1OTM4LCJleHAiOjE2MTU4Mjk1MzgsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0yODMxMjEiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.6lpYwLcyAOZgKxHujs0L7AXeVKh5QTH-cxWvPYAJ_8s&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share">agrees with the <span class="caps">NYT</span> that we&#8217;re going to see overheating, and that&#8217;s perfectly <span class="caps">OK</span> with her</a>. Nobody ever writes that we are heading for deflation&nbsp;…</p>
<h1>The sheer insanity of NFTs and aggregate <span class="caps">US</span>&nbsp;wealth</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/holy-frijoles/">Alex Manzara nails it</a>.
Assets are priced at the margin. 
If one person in a million manages to get an insane price for crap, a lot of people are, on paper at least, a lot&nbsp;wealthier.</p>
<h1>Wrap</h1>
<p>Fairly risk on/deflationary. Stimulus checks being punted on stocks on Robinhood.
Elon Musk changes his job title to &#8220;Technoking&#8221; or similar to distract from erosion of market share in many&nbsp;markets.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="caps">NDX</span> up, other equities also up, but by&nbsp;less,</li>
<li>most sectors up, apart from&nbsp;energy,</li>
<li>commodities mainly down, because of oil, nat. gas down, as&nbsp;always,</li>
<li>yields down a&nbsp;tad,</li>
<li>precious metals slightly&nbsp;up.</li>
</ul>
<p>The futures price for natural gas is around 0.8 cents/kWh, about 15% of the retail price. It&#8217;s really extremely hard to see how any &#8216;green&#8217; energy source can seriously compete with this, especially in emerging markets where governments simply do not have the money to subsidize sales of&nbsp;Teslas.</p>
