<p><a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/07/no-payment-no-problem-bizarre-new-world-of-consumer-debt/">If you reclassify debt enough, it never goes bad</a>. 
So creditors never have to worry &#8230; do they?
The funny thing is that credit card debt <a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/09/the-state-of-the-american-debt-slaves-q2-2020-the-credit-card-phenomenon/">went right down</a>, which probably mainly just reflects a crash in consumer spending. 
When Milton Friedman was in his prime, money was currency, and bank deposits. Now credit card balances must qualify as what he would call &#8220;close substitutes for money.&#8221;
If the numbers are right, then we are probably going to see an inflationary crash, in spite of all the <span class="caps">CB</span> credit&nbsp;produced. </p>
<p><a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/08/bite-the-bullet-or-extend-pretend-unemployment-v-furloughs-in-europe/">If you pay firms to &#8220;employ&#8221; workers to sit at home, you can keep unemployment rates low.</a>
So taxpayers don&#8217;t have to worry about funding the scheme &#8230; do&nbsp;they? </p>
<h2>Wirecard &mdash; more than meets the&nbsp;eye</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c8acf321-7bc7-4348-99f6-b17e01085238">This article</a> talks about Wirecard being &#8220;looted&#8221; before the fraud was discovered.
There is something more to come out from this scandal.
The thing I don&#8217;t understand is how a very high profile German company (and <span class="caps">DAX</span> constituent!) could have got away with such brazen fraud for so long.
It has to be more than lazy auditors.
Someone in a position of power was telling the authorities to hold back.
Tesla next? Who knows? <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/20/07/16488660/the-next-wirecard-20-things-to-watch-for-to-spot-a-massive-market-fraud">It&#8217;s not an original thesis</a>.</p>
<h2>Close of&nbsp;play</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s too hot to follow the markets in this weather.
I would say that risk assets were generally a fraction higher, almost certainly driven by some statement by the Treasury to the effect that they&#8217;d continue supporting markets.
The <span class="caps">NDX</span> was down a bit, but other <span class="caps">US</span> and world markets generally up ~0.25%.
Most  commodities higher, including the hydrocarbon complex, except <span class="caps">NG</span> which was down after a charging higher last week.
European sovereigns drifting higher, as the <span class="caps">ECB</span> keeps the presses&nbsp;rolling.</p>
<p><a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cSoAIqxNP5">Obesity Index is going down rapidly, like a fat man jumping off a very high diving board<img src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/SLIMID.png" width=600></a>.
$<span class="caps">AAPL</span> catching a bid in the face of grim fundamentals, but that&#8217;s the whole point of the market&nbsp;nowadays.</p>
