</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h1>Summary</h1>
<p>Equity markets returned to a positive tone, but are looking at very modest gains from a month ago. <span class="caps">SPX</span> up 3.2%, <span class="caps">IWM</span> up 6.9%, <span class="caps">NDX</span> up 4.5%. All sectors, with the exception of energy, were up&nbsp;today.</p>
<p>Bonds were down a bit: 10 year govts. were up very modestly (0.2%, but a percentage change in a yield doesn&#8217;t communicate much). The <span class="caps">US</span> 10 year yield is now at 0.741%, which while low is materially up on the 0.67% a week or so ago.
Broader equity markets are generally up, but most commodities&nbsp;down.</p>
<h1>Ideas</h1>
<p>Goldman Sachs is advocating a change to value <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/15/goldman-sachs-says-its-time-to-buy-value-stocks-and-sell-some-tech.html">reported here</a>.
One way to implement this would be to go long $<span class="caps">IWN</span> vs $<span class="caps">VONG</span>, factor ETFs for value and growth respectively, from Russell 2000 universe. Unicorn Bay thinks that <span class="caps">IWN</span> has a beta of ~0.77, whereas <span class="caps">VONG</span> has one of approx 0.95. 
For rough market neutrality, you&#8217;d need to buy approx 5 <span class="caps">IWN</span> for for every 4 <span class="caps">VONG</span>. This is not investment advice, and this would remain a very risky pair position and in any case it&#8217;s a widely held view that Goldman puts out a strategy like this in the public domain when they want to close out their own positions. You have been warned!
You can use the beta calculator tool <a href="https://unicornbay.com/tools/beta-calculator">here</a>. I suggest you use <span class="caps">SPY</span> as the market&nbsp;index.</p>
