</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h1>Funding Fact&nbsp;Sheet</h1>
<p>2018 will be the Year of Physical Activity in Hertfordshire &#8212; an
initiative being led by Hertfordshire&#8217;s 10 District and Borough
Councils, Public Health Hertfordshire and the Herts Sports and Physical
Activity Partnership. The year will be kicking off on January&nbsp;1st.**</p>
<p>The aim of the project is to make Hertfordshire, England&#8217;s most active
county and in doing so, help to shift some of the stubborn inactivity
levels to be found across the county. Hertfordshire Year of Physical
Activity 2018 - <span class="caps">HYOPA18</span> - will also enable us to shine a light on
existing programmes and opportunities for our residents to get involved
in physical activity and&nbsp;sport.</p>
<p>The project also offers an opportunity for existing organisations to
develop new projects and programmes, which can be used to encourage more
people in the county to be more active, more&nbsp;often.</p>
<p>Whilst there is no dedicated central funding pot to support such
programmes, there are a number of potential funding streams which can be
accessed to support those initiatives linked to the Hertfordshire Year
of Physical Activity&nbsp;2018.</p>
<p>Each of the fund administrators has been notified about what we are
trying to achieve and each has indicated that they will be receptive to
appropriate, well-written bids which contribute to the <span class="caps">HYOPA</span> 18&nbsp;outcomes.</p>
<p>Moreover, our funding partner, Richard Sutcliffe of Funding4Sport is
available to offer advice on any such bids, and, where required, to
formulate those bids on your behalf &#8212; subject to a small charge.
Details of the support available from Funding4Sport can be found at
<a href="http://www.sportinherts.org.uk/page/funding/funding-support-for-clubs/hsp-funding-offer-6523/">http://www.sportinherts.org.uk/page/funding/funding-support-for-clubs/hsp-funding-offer-6523/</a></p>
<p>With 1 in 3 of our residents not meeting the Chief Medical Officer&#8217;s
recommended levels of physical activity and around 1 in 5 (18.4%) doing
less than 30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise each week, we are
facing a major challenge if we are to ensure that those residents can
live long lives in good health, free from disability for as long as
possible. We are calling on all organisations to be part of this
exciting&nbsp;initiative.</p>
<p>Overleaf are details of those grant aid funding streams, which may be
accessed to support what you are considering delivering, and should you
wish to talk through any ideas please feel free to contact the <span class="caps">HYOPA18</span>
Project Coordinator Jane Parker on <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#106;&#46;&#112;&#97;&#114;&#107;&#101;&#114;&#50;&#48;&#64;&#104;&#101;&#114;&#116;&#115;&#46;&#97;&#99;&#46;&#117;&#107;">&#106;&#46;&#112;&#97;&#114;&#107;&#101;&#114;&#50;&#48;&#64;&#104;&#101;&#114;&#116;&#115;&#46;&#97;&#99;&#46;&#117;&#107;</a> who will be
pleased to offer advice and point you in the right&nbsp;direction.</p>
<h2>Some useful funding&nbsp;streams&#8230;</h2>
<h3>Herts County Council Locality&nbsp;Budgets</h3>

increase the opportunities for local councillors and communities to
decide how money is spent in their community. Each elected member of the
County Council has &pound;10,000 to spend on worthwhile projects in their
community that promote social, economic or environmental wellbeing.
Physical activity projects have been supported in the past and proposals
that can achieve local benefits may be well&nbsp;received.</p>
