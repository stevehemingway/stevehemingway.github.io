<p>Vaguely flat, after a pause in the rally yesterday.
Gold still going up, other commods likewise.
Equities flat (though Nasdaq still hitting all time highs).
Bonds flat, but given the risk-off feeling of the day, it feels like they should be on their way down.
<a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/06/seems-counter-intuitive-in-this-crisis-inflation-heats-up-for-services-companies-and-theyre-able-to-pass-it-on-via-higher-prices/">Wolf sees inflation, even in bombed-out sectors</a>.</p>
<h2>Where is the dollar&nbsp;going?</h2>
<p>Michael Howell <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8e7379c5-9324-4d31-9fcb-fd1e7bc621b0">sees</a> China pivoting to holding European bonds in place of <span class="caps">US</span> Treasury bonds. He concludes that the dollar must go down, and the Euro up. 
Certainly, the <span class="caps">ECB</span> is issuing a lot of debt, and I guess &#8220;Eurobonds&#8221; (jointly issued bonds for all Eurozone treasuries) will eventually arrive but I think that the Eurozone needs to sort out some deep seated problems before China takes the plunge.
I sort of feel bearish on the dollar, but it still has a lot going for it.
But it&#8217;s certainly right that Chinese purchases of dollar assets are dropping and will continue to drop: China is simply not exporting so much stuff (net) to <span class="caps">USD</span> denominated economies any longer.
I&#8217;m not sure where Russia fits into all this (although I&#8217;m sure that the Ruble is not about to turn into the Swiss&nbsp;Franc).</p>
<p>Personally, I think that the dollar will remain strong until inflation gets so strong that all the eighteen (?) indexes of it that the Fed looks at are clearly shouting that it&#8217;s out of control.
But by then, we will truly be in a different world. The problem is that, <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4357129-real-unemployment-situation">as this post points out</a>, unemployment is probably going to go through the roof. 
Either Bill Phillips was totally deluded, or we&#8217;re going to see subdued inflation for a long time. 
Or maybe we&#8217;re going to win 10 bonus points for spotting a rare economic phenomenon:&nbsp;stagflation.</p>
<h2>Trading&nbsp;Strategies</h2>
<p>Writing calls and puts can be a cheap way of getting into a position. 
Say you are bullish about a stock, but you think it&#8217;s trading about 10% above where you&#8217;d prefer to buy it.
If you write puts at a strike 10% out of the money, then either the stock price goes up (in which case it&#8217;s even more above the price you would be comfortable opening the position) or it goes down and the option is exercised &#8220;against you.&#8221; In fact, all that has happened is that you got the stock for 10% less than when you first thought about buying it and you&#8217;ve received the premium for giving someone the option of selling to you at a discount. Win-win! Of course, you need to evaluation what the stock is &#8220;really&#8221; worth to you. If it pays a heavy yield, then maybe it doesn&#8217;t matter if the price continues to sink. This is not an original thought, but it&#8217;s another way of looking at writing options.
<em>Obviously</em>, never do this if you don&#8217;t have the liquidity to take assignment: i.e. pay for the stock. 
Of course, it doesn&#8217;t need to be a stock. It works just as well with bond (futures), currencies, commodities etc. But it does depend on you having a clear understanding of why you want to hold the&nbsp;underlying. </p>
<p>This all works in reverse if you want to short a stock, but you&#8217;d prefer to open your position at a price above where it&#8217;s trading right now, so you get more &#8220;bang for your buck&#8221; when your plan pans out and you see the issuer go bankrupt as soon as you&#8217;ve established your position(!)
In this case, you just write the&nbsp;call.</p>
<p>Here endeth today&#8217;s lesson in option trading. Please remember that this isn&#8217;t investment advice and you simply should not do this with funds you can&#8217;t afford to&nbsp;lose.</p>
<h2>House&nbsp;Prices</h2>
<p>The owners of the Case-Shiller house price index <a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/07/us-house-prices-to-drop-6-6-by-may-2021-first-annual-decline-since-jan-2012-corelogic-owner-of-the-case-shiller-index/">point out</a> that the event of a lot of people becoming unemployed is going to be negative for house prices.
Clearly, unemployment will shift the demand schedule for housing.
Not rocket science, but a major player is saying&nbsp;it.</p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>Chinese stocks continue to do well, after the pump from the <span class="caps">PRC</span> yesterday.
Generally, stockmarket rallied, risk concerned&nbsp;faded.</p>
