<blockquote>
<p>Households own 36% of the $57 Trillion <span class="caps">US</span> equity market. ~$21 Trillion. If you add in households, active mutual funds, and passive mutual funds and ETFs this is 63% of the market. ~$36 Trillion. Hedge Funds own 3% of the $57 Trillion <span class="caps">US</span> equity market - so &#8220;Retail&#8221; is 12x more important than hedge funds. And in 2020 &#8220;retail&#8221; started trading. Prior to 2020, retail activity (single stocks and options) stayed flat for 20 years. 5 out of the top 10 largest call option volume days in history (data goes back to 1992), happened in 2021. To be continued, in a big way, and it will end like a Greek&nbsp;tragedy. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Quant/Strat star Inigo at Sanford Bernstein: &#8220;In anticipation of further reflation and rising nominal yields in the coming quarters, we decide to go tactically short low vol, which is now in-line with our recent tactical upgrade of value. Not only has low vol had a negative relationship with inflation/bond yields for the past 20 years, but valuations are also at historical extremes. While valuation alone isn’t catalyst for reversal, falling yields have has supported its re-rating – with inflation inflecting upward, low vol stocks become vulnerable to&nbsp;underperformance&#8221; </p>

<p>This seems so like&nbsp;2000. </p>

<li>everyone is fretting about the supply of semiconductors. And yet Intel ($<span class="caps">INTC</span>) is in the doldrums. Taiwan Semi (<span class="caps">TMS</span>) is a big player. $6723 (Renesas) and <span class="caps">NXP</span> ($<span class="caps">NXPI</span>) maybe caught up in the tailwind. Maybe even <span class="caps">AMD</span> ($<span class="caps">AMD</span>), which has been doing much better than Intel&nbsp;lately.</li>
<li>SPACs are going to the moon (uh, Space). There is a discussion on a recent Market Huddle.<blockquote>
<p>A deal derby in corporate debt.  S&amp;P Global reports this morning that domestic pro forma high-yield bond issuance reached $40.3 billion so far this month, surpassing the $38.3 billion last year to set a new high water mark for the opening month of the year. Last week alone saw 20 deals worth $16.4 billion according to Bank of America, making it the sixth-busiest week on record. Likewise, a slew of activity in the leveraged loan market yesterday featured some 17 deals coming to market according to Bloomberg, the busiest day since November&nbsp;30.  </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>More broadly, global corporate fundraising exceeded $400 billion through the first three weeks of the year according to data from Refinitiv, nearly double the 20-year average.  Of that sum, equity offerings accounted for $64 billion, blowing past the 2014 high-water mark near $40 billion, while blank-check companies (a.k.a. SPACs) raised $21 billion through today, already one quarter of the 2020 fundraising total, which itself exceeded all <span class="caps">SPAC</span> fundraising from prior years&nbsp;combined.</p>
