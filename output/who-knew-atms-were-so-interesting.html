<h2>ATMs</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/the-infrastructure-behind-atms/?ref=bits-about-money-newsletter">Read this</a>.
It&#8217;s about how ATMs work, by <a href="https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/patio11/">Patrick McKenzie</a>.
It&#8217;s fascinating, in that it explains, in a highly readable way,
how one boring, mundane, piece of our financial infrastructure works.
But set aside a bit of time, because it is insanely&nbsp;complicated.</p>
<p>If you think you know about money, read Patrick&#8217;s blog to discover how little you <em>really</em>&nbsp;know.</p>
<h2>What is to be done with&nbsp;commodities?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Demand<ul>
<li>China</li>
<li>Covid</li>
<li>Demographics</li>
<li>War</li>
<li>Net&nbsp;Zero</li>
<li><span class="caps">ESG</span></li>
<li>Technology (e.g.&nbsp;fusion)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Supply<ul>
<li>Financing of dirty&nbsp;tech</li>
<li>Africa, lithium,&nbsp;cobalt</li>
<li>Stranded by cancelling of&nbsp;pipelines</li>
<li>Mining tech.
Everyone agrees we&#8217;re running into a recession.
Currently, pundits say a mild one, but economic forecasters are put on
earth to make astrologers look good.
Nobody knows what will happen to China, but it doesn&#8217;t look too good at the moment.
It is on the way to becoming another <span class="caps">USSR</span>, or a Maoist state, which doesn&#8217;t auger well for 
internal demand. Eventually, the West will find someone else to make its plastic toys,
but the short-run demand trend will surely be down if things go down for Xi.
Covid in China has been a disaster, which at the very least might 
impede growth for a few&nbsp;quarters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Even without these political problems, China has terrible demographics, like the rest of the world. Old people don&#8217;t spend their time on jets circling the world. This is another headwind.
War, currently in Ukraine, but probably soon in Taiwan will be yet&nbsp;another.</p>
<p>The West seems hell-bent on killing demand for hydrocarbons, in the form of Net Zero promises. I am extremely sceptical that they can be delivered, but the current generation of leaders won&#8217;t want to lose face by admitting this, so will double down on locking us into &#8216;15 minute neighbourhoods.&#8217; All businesses will want to burnish their <span class="caps">ESG</span> credentials by using less&nbsp;carbon.</p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s a long-shot, this maybe the decade when we finally get nuclear fusion to work 
viably. This has the potential to make a big difference to the demand for oil and&nbsp;gas.</p>
<p>On the supply side, things are also looking down:
- public (and private) markets are increasingly unwilling to finance dirty technologies,
- eventually, the West will stop the evil things that are happening in cobalt mining in <span class="caps">DRC</span>, and will ban it,
- Biden and successors will keep banning pipelines to&nbsp;Canada.</p>
<p>Well, what will be the net effect on prices?
It is as clear as mud to me, but I think the big effect, the rising wealth of the world, and especially <span class="caps">EM</span> countries will be the decisive factor and that demand will increase
ahead of supply with a net effect of pushing prices up.
I could well be wrong, and a deep recession could push this trend out by a year or two,
but ultimately, I think oil will get more&nbsp;expensive.</p>
