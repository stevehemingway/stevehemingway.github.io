<li>00:03: sold some more softbank&nbsp;(9434)</li>
<li>01:49: Somehow bought 4 <span class="caps">AUD</span>. Think this was a left-over stop. Anyway, made money on&nbsp;it!</li>
<li>06:17: sold Mar&nbsp;Z. </li>
<li>06:33: bot <span class="caps">GC</span> (chaos, not&nbsp;inflation)</li>
<li>08:03: 21 Mar 3000 puts on <span class="caps">ESTX50</span> sold at 155.30 and bought back (stop) at 181.90 40 mins later&nbsp;(ugh!)</li>
<li>08:46: Sold 1 <span class="caps">MXEA</span>&nbsp;Mar</li>
<li>09:04: sold 3 <span class="caps">SX7P</span>&nbsp;Mar</li>
<li>09:06: sold 1 <span class="caps">TOPX</span>&nbsp;Mar</li>
<li>10:22: bought 1 <span class="caps">EUR</span>&nbsp;Mar</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, had instinctive feeling that today was going down. Racheted up my exposure to $327.9K margin.&nbsp;Scary!</p>
<p>Mondays are odd, because the <span class="caps">US</span> markets don&#8217;t get going until the <span class="caps">US</span> morning, so there are no live prices for <span class="caps">ES</span> in the morning. Your exposure to the far east via <span class="caps">US</span> derivatives (<span class="caps">FXI</span> puts) is considerable. This is likely to be a huge day for you. The question now is how to avoid getting crushed by the bounce. You have to unwind, but what do you&nbsp;trade??</p>
<p>The most amazing thing about the markets is that no new information has appeared in the last week or two. Coronavirus was known about in January. The overvaluation of <span class="caps">US</span> markets was known then. The likelihood that <span class="caps">US</span> interest rates would go to zero (like in Europe and Japan) was predicted months and months ago. The weak growth of the world economy (especially the <span class="caps">US</span> economy, whose notional real <span class="caps">GDP</span> growth was boosted by dubious hedonic adjustments to the <span class="caps">GDP</span> deflator). None of this really mattered until a dislocation in the market forced participants (now, probably, algorithms channeling human actors) to see the world from a different&nbsp;perspective.</p>
<h2>After&nbsp;lunch</h2>
<p>No point in trying to list sales. Basically, you unwound some of your exposure through straight short futures positions in Australia, Japan, Europe. After an initial phase in which circuit breakers halted trading, the <span class="caps">ES</span> market started to rise. You actually bought one <span class="caps">ES</span>&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>At one point you were up 20%, $197K. You could not realise this, no bids or offers in many long dated options&nbsp;positions.</p>
<p>This morning&#8217;s (<span class="caps">US</span> time) action will condition the algos not to but the dip so enthusiastically in future. Whether I can replicate this performance again this month is debatable. Hopefully, the bull will be slain and we&#8217;ll grind down for the rest of the year. Margin back to ~$250K in &gt;$1M. You still have a lot to make&nbsp;back.</p>
<h2>3:30pm</h2>
<p>Market recovering a bit. Bought a couple of <span class="caps">ES</span>, to blunt the&nbsp;impact.</p>
<p>Got short (via puts, looking for liquid ones) for <span class="caps">MM</span>, <span class="caps">VZ</span>, <span class="caps">SBUX</span> and <span class="caps">BA</span>. <span class="caps">VZ</span> because it seemed to have held up so&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>Lesson: good and bad stocks will be pulled down together because so much trading is via&nbsp;ETFs.</p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>One of the most extreme days in the market in recent history. Saudi, coronavirus, waking up. You were up 20%, which is good, but with many equities markets moving 7% this was not as good as it might have been. You kept your risk under control, and maintained your stops, so you were definitely more disciplined than you have been in the&nbsp;past.</p>
