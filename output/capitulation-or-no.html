<h2>Bear Cave&nbsp;109</h2>
<p>I am a huge fan of <a href="https://twitter.com/StockJabber">Edwin Dorsey</a>. He writes a weekly newsletter (free!) with 
stocks which may be worth looking at more closely, of which the management may have been involved in fraud.
The price of these stocks have usually crashed before I get to check the price, but at least his means
that these leads would have lead to profits if only they&#8217;d been seen earlier.
<span class="caps">TBF</span>, I think some have been in  decline for&nbsp;years.</p>

<h3>Halo Technologies ($<span class="caps">HAL</span>:<span class="caps">ASX</span>)</h3>
<p>(Note that this stock may have become de-listed. I can&#8217;t find it&nbsp;anywhere.)</p>
<p>Infinite Nuance published on upcoming <span class="caps">IPO</span> Halo Technologies (<span class="caps">ASX</span>: <span class="caps">HAL</span>), an Australian financial services conglomerate. Infinite Nuance criticized the company’s executive compensation plan tied to <span class="caps">EBITDA</span> and questioned why the majority of the company’s revenue comes from related-party customers. Infinite Nuance also questioned the company’s rich valuation and&nbsp;wrote,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“At <span class="caps">IPO</span>, Halo will have a fully diluted market capitalization of $176 million at the minimum level of offer, and historical pro-forma trailing <span class="caps">EBITDA</span> of $1.9m. Using the forward <span class="caps">FY22</span> <span class="caps">EBITDA</span> performance target of $2.5m as a guide, Halo will list at 70.4x <span class="caps">EBITDA</span>.”

<h3>Membership Collective Group ($<span class="caps">NYSE</span>:<span class="caps">MCG</span>)</h3>
<p><span class="caps">CFO</span> of Membership Collective Group (<span class="caps">NYSE</span>: <span class="caps">MCG</span> — $1.59 billion) resigned after one and a half years “due to factors outside the Company.” The company is down nearly 40% since its July 2021 <span class="caps">IPO</span>.</p>
<h2>Tightening</h2>
<p>The Fed may be the Wizard of Oz, and <span class="caps">QE</span> nothing more than a three card trick, but while a lot of people believe in the Fed to make every problem go away.
Well, it didn&#8217;t quite work in 2008, and it probably won&#8217;t&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>With rates being forced up at the short end by central banks, we are within spitting distance of seeing an inverted yield curve. Mostly, I&#8217;ve looked at yields on (e.g.) 10Y Treasuries vs 5Y or 2Y. 
@MacroAlf has some deep insights into yield curves in <a href="https://themacrocompass.substack.com/p/ois-yield-curve?s=r">this post</a>.
He basically says that you can&#8217;t rely on yields on treasuries because their pricing is distorted by their role as a source of collateral for lending, because they are given zero risk weightings by banking regulators. Alf has spend a lot of time explaining the intricacies of fixed income markets to readers of his blog. You should sign up, because even if I could be sure I understood his points fully, you&#8217;d be better off getting it from the horse&#8217;s mouth, as it&nbsp;were.</p>
<p>He actually explains <em>why</em> inverting of the yield curve is a problem. Basically, it&#8217;s a matter of the long end giving an estimator of the long-run marginal utility of capital and the short run a measure of expectation of policy rates.
Alf considers that you need to look out about five years to see an expectation of a central bank&#8217;s policy cycle. If you look at 3M or even 2Y, you get only part of a tightening (or loosening) cycle, so you don&#8217;t get a full measure of policy rates.
The idea is for the policy to rate to be around, or less than &#8220;r-star,&#8221; the policy rate that keeps the economy at full employment. An inversion of the yield curve suggests that markets expect policy rates to be too high, and that they will result in the rate of growth in the economy to dip below its equilibrium&nbsp;rate. </p>
<p>The equilibrium rate is itself a function of the rate of growth of productivity. 
I found <a href="https://www.caixabankresearch.com/en/economics-markets/monetary-policy/would-digital-boost-productivity-put-end-low-interest-rates">this interesting paper</a> which explains why this is the case, and why ever-falling productivity has forced rates in developed markets ever lower. In the whole period since the world started globalizing in the 1990s, the rate of productivity growth in developed markets has been extremely low. 
I don&#8217;t have time to discuss this here, but this surely is down to our pivot to a largely service-based economy where all primary and secondary production have been outsourced to low-wage economies like&nbsp;China.</p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>Basically, Europe decided that it might stop importing Russian oil, which caused oil prices to spike higher.
Yields went up, as did the dollar. I would generally say it was a risk-on day, although European equities went down.
The <span class="caps">US</span> indices managed a modest rise, but with the <span class="caps">SPX</span> having done up about five days in a row, surely a correction is&nbsp;imminent.</p>
