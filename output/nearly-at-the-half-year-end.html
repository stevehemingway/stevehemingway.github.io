<h2>Covid</h2>
<p>So many people have Covid. Everyone is coughing. 
Supposedly, this is the <span class="caps">BA</span>.5 variant.
I just know that a lot of people I personally know have got tested positive.
This thing is not going out without kicking and screaming.
I am not sure govt. policy could have made much difference, but I can now see why the authorities were very&nbsp;afraid.</p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>Mainly, oil slumped back today.
Most commodities were knocked back.
Equities were weak, and yields were down.
We had a weak risk-off&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>Jim Chanos has decided to short data centre REITs.
$<span class="caps">DLR</span> (Digital realty) and $<span class="caps">EQIX</span> (Equinix) have foreward P/E&#8217;s in the 70s. 
Given we&#8217;re in a bear market, you can understand Chanos&#8217;s&nbsp;logic. </p>
<p>Inflation is hitting hard at Eurozone economies. It&#8217;s really hard to see how the <span class="caps">ECB</span> can control inflation and at the same time
keep Italian and Greek spreads from blowing up.
The market seems to have decided that M Lagarde is an idiot, and the consequences for the Euro (vs <span class="caps">USD</span>) are likely to be grim.
Of course, currencies are incredibly unpredictable, and there are many other moving&nbsp;parts.</p>
<p>The Japanese Yen had another bad day. The <span class="caps">JPY</span> is now over 136 to to the <span class="caps">USD</span>, and going lower (i.e. the exchange rate is getting numerically&nbsp;higher).</p>
<h2>Twitter</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/1541963822621229056?s=20&amp;t=MUi4b8l2p5EfhukvkXJRsA"><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>If you want to create a shortage of tomatoes, for example, just pass a law that retailers can’t sell tomatoes for more than two cents per pound. Instantly you’ll have a tomato shortage. It’s the same with oil or gas.” - Milton Friedman cc:&nbsp;G-7</a></p>

<h2>Thought of the&nbsp;day</h2>
<p>Some state in the <span class="caps">US</span> is going to hand out dollars direct to residents to offset inflation.
Mick Lynch, the <span class="caps">RMT</span> union leader is everywhere talking about how his members are striking because they have become more productive, but have not shared in the gains.
<a href="https://twitter.com/UBILabWales/status/1541671541011775488?s=20&amp;t=MUi4b8l2p5EfhukvkXJRsA">The Welsh govt. is about to experiment with some form of <span class="caps">UBI</span>.</a>
It&#8217;s just for young people exiting the care system, but it&#8217;s a watershed of sorts.
The <span class="caps">MMT</span> community is deeply divided over <span class="caps">UBI</span>, but we give a sort of <span class="caps">UBI</span> to pensioners, so why not give it to care leavers?
I am not an expert on <span class="caps">MMT</span>, but my understanding is that most prefer a job guarantee, where unemployment is eliminated by paying
people to do socially useful work.
I have a low opinion of the Welsh Assembly, but if this works well, it will strongly increase the chances of it being adopted throughout the <span class="caps">UK</span>.
We need some original policy ideas, even fringe&nbsp;ones.</p>
