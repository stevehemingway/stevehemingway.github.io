<h1>Quantumscape: fraud or no&nbsp;fraud?</h1>
<p>The <span class="caps">WSJ</span> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-hot-battery-startup-that-could-zap-tesla-11609497031">says</a> that Quantumscape, which is developing solid state batteries that are superior to the liquid electrolyte ones already in use will disadvantage $<span class="caps">TSLA</span> because it uses rolled cylinder batteries, whereas its competitors all use prismatic ones.
Solid state batteries cannot be rolled, so they stack better.
I&#8217;m not completely convinced, but $<span class="caps">QS</span> should not be shorted (in spite of just having dropped by&nbsp;~15%!).</p>
<p>Banx nails it: (from the <span class="caps">FT</span>)</p>
<p><img alt="f03b5a118da75e3d38675668cfc3614c.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/f03b5a118da75e3d38675668cfc3614c.png"></p>
<h1>Central Bank Digital&nbsp;Currency</h1>
<p>I have a google alert for the title of this section. I get half a dozen hits ever day.
<a href="https://www.paymentsjournal.com/japan-doesnt-want-to-be-late-with-a-digital-currency/">This</a> is a representative recent one but there are literally hundreds.
Central banks are simply banks which account holders restricted to commercial banks and governments.
Once they get a digital currency, there will be nothing preventing large corps having accounts,
and in due course individuals. This will really tighten the link between money supply and&nbsp;inflation.</p>
<h1>Most amazing frauds of&nbsp;2020</h1>
<p>These are the ones that came to light. I am confident that some more will emerge in&nbsp;2021.</p>
<h2>Wirecard</h2>
<p>Wirecard ($<span class="caps">WDI</span>.<span class="caps">DE</span>), for so long a rising, high-tech star of the German stock market was shown to be a fraud.
Not only was it amazing to see a top member of the <span class="caps">DAX</span> exposed as a huge fraud (and see its stock price crash from €145 to €0.31 in a matter of days) but to see the <span class="caps">FT</span>, which had basically been saying that it was a fraud for years, proved right.
The story is fascinating, but the thing that particularly sticks in my mind are the attempts by the German equivalent of the <span class="caps">SEC</span> try to arrest the journalists trying to expose the fraud, rather than the crooks perpetrating&nbsp;it.</p>
<h2>Ant&nbsp;Group</h2>
<p>Jack Ma flew close to the sun (king), Xi, and fell to earth. This one will run and&nbsp;run.</p>
<h2><span class="caps">XRP</span> investigated by <span class="caps">SEC</span></h2>
<p>I think the real whale is Tether, a supposed stable coin, but not really backed by anything. 
I have followed <span class="caps">XRP</span> for many, many years (even mined a bit).
It seems very clever: maybe too good to be true.
The artfully contrived distinction betwee <span class="caps">XRP</span> and Ripple always confused&nbsp;me.</p>
<h1><span class="caps">MMT</span> is already here, it&#8217;s just not evenly&nbsp;distributed</h1>
<p><img alt="img" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/EqqPuyYXMAEXfl_.png"></p>

<h1>It&#8217;s always too early to buy&nbsp;gold</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/still-too-early-to-buy-gold-5094055">This article</a> says it, but in more&nbsp;words.</p>
<h1>The long and the short of&nbsp;it</h1>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/LSValue">@LSValue</a> put his top picks on Twitter. They&nbsp;are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Long: $<span class="caps">SEAC</span> (SeaChange), $<span class="caps">IAC</span> (Interactive Corp), $<span class="caps">ANGI</span> (Angies List), $<span class="caps">WIX</span> (Wix), $<span class="caps">IDN</span>&nbsp;(Intellicheck),</li>
<li>Short: $<span class="caps">QS</span> (QuantumScape), $<span class="caps">PEN</span> (Penumbra), $<span class="caps">BLNK</span> (Blink Charging), $<span class="caps">BYND</span> (Beyond Meat), $<span class="caps">NKLA</span>&nbsp;(Nikola).</li>
</ul>
<p>I have never heard of most of any of the longs. $<span class="caps">QS</span> is mentioned above, $<span class="caps">PEN</span> is surely heading to zero, $<span class="caps">BLNK</span> and $<span class="caps">BYND</span> don&#8217;t have any material competitive advantage that I am aware of, and $<span class="caps">NKLA</span> has been exposed as a&nbsp;fraud. </p>
<p>Once the market turns, the shorts might be worth checking out more carefully. The longs: not so sure. Intellicheck does instant verification of photo <span class="caps">ID</span>. Sounds great, but I am not sure they are the only ones doing&nbsp;it.</p>
<h1>Why we need more young people in&nbsp;charge</h1>
<p>Humans (and other species) evolved memory as a strategy for avoiding danger.
Our ancestors who remembered nearly being eaten by a saber toothed tiger when going down to the water hole in the evening were the ones who survived long enough to reproduce.
That&#8217;s why our memory of negative emotions (shame, humiliation, danger) is so much stronger than that of positive ones.
The net result is that our aged leaders become afraid of their own shadown, and refuse to try anything new or remotely risky.
It&#8217;s illogical, because as we age we have less life left to lose. But it&#8217;s how we&#8217;re programmed.
Younger leaders would also put more resources into childcare, education and sports, and less into the health service and other services for the aged and sick. (My favourite statistic: we spend 80% of the whole <span class="caps">NHS</span> budget on patients who will be dead within 24&nbsp;months.)</p>
