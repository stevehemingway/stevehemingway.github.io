</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h2>MLPs</h2>
<p>Trading ideas: I have a vague idea that MLPs are going down. 
I heard someone on a podcast, or caught some Twitter post saying that these were a tax-driven structure that would not survive a downturn. My understanding is that they are bit like REITs for pipelines. 
Obviously, I just need to find out a bit more about them.
<span class="caps">AMLP</span> is a big <span class="caps">ETF</span> of these things. 
I collected together a  Koyfin dashboard of ETFs <a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5ee87e9f670b897849a9499d">here</a>. 
I struggle with Koyfin to click through to research. 
With a dividend yield of ~15%, and a P/E of ~8 <span class="caps">MPLX</span> looks good value, but with a 1-year return of -30% maybe the stock does not come without risk.
It&#8217;s cheap now, and had an up day yesterday (up 6%) so shorting would be a risky&nbsp;proposition.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/netflix-stock-is-still-a-buy-says-one-analyst-51592265084">This is the bull case</a>.
If you google &#8220;fraud mlp&#8221; you get a lot of hits.
It seems that a lot of MLPs are destined to convert to corporations.
They do seem to be a very complex sort of security, but they are a lot cheaper now than they were and, possibly, 
energy is poised for a pullback. 
My conclusion, for the moment, is that they should be avoided as an investment, either on the long or the short&nbsp;side.</p>
<p>If anyone has a view, <span class="caps">DM</span> me,&nbsp;@stevehem.</p>
<h2>Market&nbsp;comment</h2>
<p>The Fed announced it&#8217;d start buying individual corporate bonds yesterday (rather than paying fat fees to BlackRock to assemble them into ETFs, which would be given a free credit insurance by the Treasury). This provoked a bounce.
Then, overnight, Trump announced another $1Trn in infrastructure spending.
As far as Trump and his cronies go, they certainly believe doing whatever it takes (in terms of spending tax dollars) to get him re-elected. But, as Kevin Muir always says, we&#8217;re here to guess what will happen, not what we think should&nbsp;happen.</p>
<p>My tentative response was to get as delta neutral as possible, with respect to equities, while writing a few tiny calls on the more insane penny stocks. You can see a list <a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5ee0b537c8647bc77bd4d9fb">here</a> but many of these don&#8217;t have options as they they are not really&nbsp;companies.</p>
<p>My feeling is that with so much dollar printing, real assets and non-dollar currencies should do well, but picking the right ones might be tricky.
Silver and gold have not yet taken off. At some point, I think they might, but patience is a&nbsp;virtue.</p>
<h2>Vix</h2>
<p>I occasionally go long the <span class="caps">VIX</span> futures, via puts.
It has worked, but with the Fed fire brigade, it&#8217;s difficult to pull this off.
Any sign of the market getting twitchy and a new Fed facility is announced.
I sold a single fix put (actually, a put on a nearby <span class="caps">VIX</span> future but &#8230;). This uses up a lot of collateral, but with an <span class="caps">IV</span> of 127% it seemed safe(ish). With J Powell <span class="amp">&amp;</span> S Mnuchin appointed as the leaders of the <span class="caps">VIX</span>-killers, maybe I&#8217;ll live to regret&nbsp;this.</p>
<h2>Bonds</h2>
<p>Bonds normally are negatively correlated with <span class="caps">SPX</span> and this relationship has held even over the last crazy six months.
I cannot help but wonder whether at some point the Fed will lose control of the yield curve. 
I know that the BoJ has carried it off, but the Yen is not the dollar and the <span class="caps">USA</span> is running a big current account deficit. We shall&nbsp;see. </p>
<h2>SPACs</h2>
<p>You probably don&#8217;t want to know what these are. 
If you really don&#8217;t want to take my advice, join <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/">r/SPACs</a>.</p>
<h2>End of&nbsp;day</h2>
<p>As far as I can see now (19:20 <span class="caps">BST</span>), we&#8217;ve had a 100% risk-on day. Every equity market on the planet, with the exception of Brazil, is up. Commods (except precious metals) are up. 
I don&#8217;t understand Brazil. 
Bonds are down, at least Treasuries, but not by much, which indicates that the smart money is not convinced that the pandemic is over.
I don&#8217;t understand how J Powell can boost stock prices in Tokyo, but a rising tide lifts all boats, I&nbsp;guess.</p>
<p>My call selling is not a disaster, but is yet to pay off in spades. It&#8217;s very expensive in terms of capital, so I am not inclined to scale it&nbsp;up.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all,&nbsp;folks!</p>
