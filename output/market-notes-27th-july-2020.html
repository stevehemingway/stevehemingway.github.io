<p>The Credit Writedowns newsletter is good, but I am just too stingy to pay to see behind the paywall.
<a href="https://pro.creditwritedowns.com/p/political-impasse-over-jobless-claims?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTAyMDI1LCJwb3N0X2lkIjo3Mjg5MzEsIl8iOiJxUnE2VSIsImlhdCI6MTU5NTg0MzY3NCwiZXhwIjoxNTk1ODQ3Mjc0LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMjEzNCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.050CQlaSBIjqK0KE0z28dHZ5Cx_1ZDvJakItWqiwErc">This article</a> is a rare one that can be seen by everyone.
It&#8217;s not amazing, but it&#8217;s pretty clear about predicting a really bad jobs number this week.
The only issue is how the (equity) market takes&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>As far as today&#8217;s markets are concerned, precious metals are up, the yield curve seems to be flattening, other commodities are not doing very much and <span class="caps">FX</span> is fairly subdued, although the dollar continues to trend down.
It seems odd to see commodities (well, money-like commodities) so strong against flat equity and bond markets.
Dr Copper is not giving a clear prognosis, but he certainly doesn&#8217;t see the economy returning to robust health for some considerable time, even with China putting the pedal to the metal in infrastructure&nbsp;spending.</p>
<p>My mood today is that the sheer scale of money creation will end up forcing equity markets higher, 
in spite of their insane over-valuation. However, I can barely convince myself. 
The famous Robinhood traders (or <em>bagholders</em> as they would probably be referred to in the dealing rooms of the City) may just keep the markets trending higher for a few more weeks but it&#8217;s hard to see them higher still in a year&#8217;s&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>The dollar&#8217;s weakness is not a certainty. Well, that&#8217;s an information-free sentence, but what I mean is that as <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/tech-stocks-tanked-blame-it-on-the-value-of-the-dollar-51595638215">this article</a> points out, with pessimism about the dollar hitting all-time highs, we might be due for a dollar rally.
This would then be good for Amazon and co.&nbsp;I </p>
<p>An interesting view, put forward by Grant Williams, is that the reason that the <span class="caps">FAANG</span>+ has done so well is not that their fortunes have much to do with technology, but that they are all still largely under the control of their founders <em>and the float of their shares in issue is very low.</em> The combination of being in an index (<span class="caps">NQ</span>), and having a low float (or just being a hot stock and &#8230;) is explosive. This is certainly consistent with poor performance from &#8220;old&#8221; tech companies, like <span class="caps">IBM</span>, which presumably have a high float.
The interesting thing is that really stocks like $<span class="caps">INTC</span> and $<span class="caps">TMC</span> are relatively cheap, at least compared to $<span class="caps">FB</span>, which is really just an advertising company.
I&#8217;d be interested in knowing how to screen stocks for high insider&nbsp;ownership.</p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>The day finished much as it started, except there was a huge ramp towards the end for Robinhood type stocks.
$<span class="caps">TSLA</span> jumped 9%. You can see the list <a href="https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/1287824560621051905">here</a> courtesy of Zerohedge. I keep <a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5ee0b537c8647bc77bd4d9fb">my own list</a> of these kind of stocks.
At some point they are going down a lot, but for the moment I am just holding onto my capital and battening down the hatches.
In a story I can&#8217;t find to link to, I read that insider sells are at a&nbsp;high.</p>
