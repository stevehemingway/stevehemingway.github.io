</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I stole this from <span class="caps">TME</span>, which is now paywalled. It&#8217;s well worth&nbsp;reading. </p>
<h1>(When) is Cathie’s 27% discount placing&nbsp;coming?</h1>
<p>Liquidity is an issue, and most people do not think about the liquidity factor until it&#8217;s too late, including risk&nbsp;managers.</p>
<p>Two takeaways from Friday&#8217;s&nbsp;sessions;</p>
<p>1, the extreme px axction in Baidu, Tencent Music, Vipshop, Viacom, Discovery, Farfetch, iQiyi and <span class="caps">GSX</span>. For more reading on who and how they sold these positions see here. One thing is sure, when even big names trade with this type of liquidity, stability does not come to our minds as one of the strong factors of this&nbsp;market.</p>
<p>2, the second observation is that despite these names oscillating massively, market shrugged off this and squeezed into the&nbsp;close.</p>
<p>It does not matter who was behind the original sales of these stocks, but more importantly is to consider the illiquid market environment we are living&nbsp;in.</p>
<p>Even seasoned fund and risk managers tend to get surprised when things go the &#8220;impossible&#8221;&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>Regular readers of <span class="caps">TME</span> know our take on last year&#8217;s hottest fund,&nbsp;Ark-funds.</p>
<p>We have covered <span class="caps">ARKK</span> in various notes over the past months. On Feb 17 we warned our readers about the <span class="caps">ARKK</span> hype as we&nbsp;wrote;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span><span class="caps">ARKK</span> - everybody worried not enough stuff to&nbsp;buy&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;but looks like people should care more about how it behaves when they need to&nbsp;sell.</p>
<p><span class="caps">ARKK</span>, investing in stuff that &#8220;changes the way the world works&#8221;, but as always you need to ask yourself at what price are they changing the world, as well how does it behave in terms of liquidity on the way down, just in&nbsp;case.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since then <span class="caps">ARKK</span> has crashed by some 25%. The &#8220;stress&#8221; of not enough things to buy has turned into discussions of how to manage the downside&nbsp;risks.</p>
<p>On March 15 <span class="caps">ARK</span> released a video discussion, A Capacity <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Liquidity Analysis by <span class="caps">ARK</span>&nbsp;Invest</p>
<p><span class="caps">TME</span>&#8217;s take on the 1 hour video was basically as outlined here. We&nbsp;wrote;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Needless to say, but having three &#8220;<span class="caps">ARK</span> people&#8221; including the big &#8220;boss&#8221; talk about her own funds and liquidity is hardly an objective approach to risk and liquidity&nbsp;management.</p>
<p>How do they manage downside risk is basically, according to&nbsp;Cathie;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>..we will put in more large cap stocks in the portfolio&#8230;.which we see as cash&#8230;.when risk off hits the market&#8230;.we sell &#8220;cash&nbsp;stocks&#8221;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Go figure what the funds will end up with if things turn properly sour&#8230;.Highly illiquid stocks impossible to&nbsp;manage.</p>
<p>Anyone that has managed a big book of illiquid assets knows how hard these &#8220;things&#8221; are to&nbsp;manage.</p>
<p>During this one hour presentation there is a lot of mentions of &#8220;if we are right&#8221;&#8230;but not one mention of &#8220;if we are&nbsp;wrong.</p>
<p>Anybody talking about risk and liquidity management that does not talk about &#8220;what if we are wrong&#8221; has little clue about real risk&nbsp;management.&#8221;</p>
<p>Huge funds that have to release video presentations of how they manage the downside should probably be a warning sign&nbsp;itself.</p>
<p>The number one rule in managing risk is to &#8220;master&#8221; your downside in order for your p/l to not fall too much. After that lesson comes various other aspects of how to optimize your p/l on the way up (i.e what and how do you do when your trading is doing&nbsp;well).</p>
<p>Anyway, first chart shows performance of the top 10 names in <span class="caps">ARKK</span> since mid Feb. The best one is believe it or not Tesla, down&nbsp;22%.</p>
<p>Second and third images show the <span class="caps">ARKK</span> top 10 names in terms of size. Bidu was <span class="caps">ARK</span>&#8217;s biggest buy last week. Only on Friday <span class="caps">ARKK</span> added 323,410 shares to <span class="caps">ARKK</span>, and total <span class="caps">BIDU</span> longs to the <span class="caps">ARK</span> &#8220;family&#8221; on Friday was around 545k&nbsp;shares.</p>
<p>Cathie buying more of a crashing stock she is already very long is the classical averaging down strategy, which is a very dangerous strategy. Sure, Bidu and other crashed ex hot names could bounce, but that is not how you conduct risk management. That strategy is based on hope and <span class="caps">NOT</span> efficient risk&nbsp;management.</p>
<p><span class="caps">ARKK</span> is down from 160 to 114 in little more than a month. 200 day moving average is down at 106. Our logic from mid Feb (see above) continues to hold. Obviously the price is down a lot, but the bigger picture problem is how does <span class="caps">ARK</span> funds start behaving should we see more of those moves we saw on&nbsp;Friday?</p>
<p>Averaging down is the casino mentality so many traders and portfolio managers get &#8220;stuck&#8221; in. Focus goes from managing risk to justifying with fundamental reasons why you have a position on and add to it when it goes against you. This becomes a dangerous game when you run external&nbsp;money.</p>
<p>Imagine bigger redemptions would hit some of Cathie&#8217;s funds? After all external money does not care how you performed 1, 2 or 5 years ago. They want you to always&nbsp;perform.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with adding to losing trades is the fact that &#8220;making it back&#8221; is extremely much harder than following a rigorous p/l management&nbsp;methodology.</p>
<p>After all, losing 40-50% is not hard (just look at <span class="caps">TDOC</span> in <span class="caps">ARKK</span>&#8217;s portfolio, down 40% since mid Feb), but in order to break even on a 50% draw down, you have to make &#8220;back&#8221; 100%. How easy is it to make&nbsp;100%?</p>
<p>Last image shows the simple table of how much you have to &#8220;make back&#8221; in order to break even on an X initial loss. Nothing new really, but few think about it, and even fewer have a method of how to manage it (not to mention how few people know how to behave when things go your way, ie adding to good p/l by expanding&nbsp;risk).</p>
<p>Instead, people tend to trade constant risk (totally wrong), and are happy to average down instead of averaging &#8220;up&#8221; (adding to winning&nbsp;p/l).</p>
<p>More on all of this later, but for now we ask ourselves will Cathie&#8217;s <span class="caps">ARK</span> need to be placing stocks at discounts should liquidity become a real&nbsp;issue?</p>
