<h2>Collapse in <span class="caps">US</span>&nbsp;lending</h2>
<p>Various reflation skeptics, such as Lacy Hunt, Harley Bassman, Jeff Snider have been saying that inflation is going to crater. 
As I blogged a while ago, the increasing inequality in the <span class="caps">US</span> and elsewhere has caused the propensity to spend to plummet. 
In my day job, I&#8217;ve been trying to borrow, and even for a (private) company with a  balance sheet which is as solid as a rock, the longer-term rate I was quoted was a spread of ~5% above <span class="caps">LIBOR</span>. 
To me, this tells me that nobody wants to lend to such a company. Presumably, they&#8217;d prefer to buy gilts at&nbsp;85bp. </p>
<p>Anyway, I thought I&#8217;d check out exactly bad things are. Well, <span class="caps">FRED</span> told me, and I think it&#8217;s pretty&nbsp;bad.</p>
<p>You can take a closer look <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=H0Cz">here</a> but the chart below clearly shows that although this trend has been going on since Greenspan&#8217;s day, it&#8217;s got worse and worse.
Of course, the banks are being stuffed with deposits, because of <span class="caps">QE</span>, but this shows how little of the money created ever gets put to productive use. If nobody is spending, it seems likely that price pressure will remain&nbsp;muted.</p>
<p><img src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=H0Cz" alt="loan to deposit ratio"></p>
<p>I always struggle to get these sorts of charts from the BoE website, but I&#8217;d be surprised if it&#8217;s very different. 
Countries have to keep their monetary policies in line, if they have a hope of avoiding letting their currencies rise against the dollar. 
Maybe Evergrande is an example of what this leads&nbsp;to.</p>
<h2>Techie&nbsp;note</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve taken to using Windows Powershell recently.
It&#8217;s a learning curve for me, but it seems to work <span class="caps">OK</span>.
What&#8217;s really annoying, though, is that it doesn&#8217;t use <span class="caps">UTF8</span> encoding by default.
This, specifically, means that if I capture stdout to a file, it&#8217;s not <span class="caps">UTF8</span> and it will spook a program that expects such an encoding as&nbsp;input.</p>
<p>This can be fixed in something like Notepad++ or by using out-file with an -Encoding parameter, but it&#8217;s niggling. Anyway, the fix is to install Powershell 6 or 7 on windows. This is very easy, and fixes the problems at a stroke, because its default text encoding is <span class="caps">UTF8</span>. </p>
<p>If you are an American, you probably don&#8217;t care, but if you are a European and you want to use symbols like £ and € you&nbsp;might.</p>
<p>I hit this problem specifically when using <a href="https://hledger.org/">hledger</a> but I now realize that it had tripped me up before when using command line programs.  Hledger is a fab system, if you like doing things in text on the command&nbsp;line.</p>
<p>I used <a href="https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/2019/03/how-to-install-and-update-powershell-6/">this page</a> to find out how to upgrade my powershell, but there are many with similar instructions. If you are feeling brave, you can just paste this into <span class="caps">PS5</span> and click &#8220;<span class="caps">OK</span>&#8221; a couple of&nbsp;times:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>iex &quot;&amp; { $(irm https://aka.ms/install-powershell.ps1) } -UseMSI&quot;  
</code></pre></div>

<p>It seems perverse that <span class="caps">MS</span> are so slow in making this the default that ships with Windows&nbsp;10.</p>

<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>Pretty much a standard risk-on day.
10Y yield now hitting 1.4%, <span class="caps">DXY</span> weak (back to 93), stocks generally up.
Commodities strong, oil up 1.3%, Brent &gt; $77/barrel.
Markets don&#8217;t really believe that the Fed will ever taper.
Someone pointed out that Pfizer is the sixth most widely held stock by members of&nbsp;Congress.</p>
