<li><a href="https://corporate.nordea.com/article/64474/fx-weekly-nothing-else-matters-than-the-usd">Nordea put out a first class macro note as usual</a>. The takeaways are: buy <span class="caps">USD</span>, sell <span class="caps">SEK</span>, <span class="caps">EUR</span>. Suggests going long <span class="caps">AUD</span>/<span class="caps">NZD</span> based on <span class="caps">ZN</span> central bank policy divergence. It&#8217;s always a good read, and it&#8217;s&nbsp;free!</li>
<li>Negative note on $<span class="caps">BYND</span>. I&#8217;ve never been convinced about this company. <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4416445-beyond-meat-stock-steer-clear-here?mail_subject=bynd-beyond-meat-more-pain-down-the-road&amp;utm_campaign=rta-stock-article&amp;utm_content=link-0&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=seeking_alpha">Here</a>.</li>
<li>The Market Eye makes a good point about a distressing lack of liquidity in large-cap <span class="caps">US</span> equities. We know that this has been a problem for a while, as demonstrated by various ramp operations, not least by Elon Musk with $<span class="caps">TSLA</span>. The suspicion is that reported volume is partially or largely wash sales between related parties. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what happens to the market when a player bigger than Bill Hwang gets into&nbsp;trouble.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Both <span class="caps">CBS</span> ($30bn market cap) and Discovery ($20bn market cap) were down a neat 27% Friday, on what appears to be (allegedly) forced selling from Tiger Cub Archegos Capital. If this is the truth and there is nothing else going on here - this is a horrendous data-point on the true liquidity in the markets. The rumored &#8220;block offerings&#8221; from <span class="caps">MS</span> and <span class="caps">GS</span> were not multiple days of average volume. These are not some Mickey Mouse companies with shaky fundamentals. The only thing that is shaky is the &#8220;true&#8221; liquidity in the equity markets. Because it is non-existent. In a &#8220;normal&#8221; world this would have been done at maximum 5-10%&nbsp;down. </p>

<li><span class="caps">TME</span> points out that <span class="caps">ARK</span> has no clue about how to manage risk. I copied the text <a href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/tme-take-on-ark.html">here</a> since it&#8217;s&nbsp;paywalled.</li>
<li>Find out more about <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/what-we-can-learn-from-a-big-boat">Matt Stoller</a>. He&#8217;s a commentator who has written extensively about the threat posed by the accumulation of power by the corporate sector in the <span class="caps">USA</span>. As you are probably aware, I think this is a huge problem both in the <span class="caps">USA</span> and Europe, certainly compared to the attention it receives. I am not sure I dare say it, but to me it looks like a much bigger problem than anthropogenic global warming. The interesting problem is how the end game plays out. It could be very&nbsp;destructive.</li>

He explains a bit more about how the shell game is set up, how the 2000 crash mirrors the current one and why &#8220;Project Zimbabwe&#8221; will not save SPACs. Kuppy is always worth&nbsp;reading.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/we-good-now">We Work (and aliases) has an insane story</a>. It&#8217;s one of the &#8220;rolling series of bubbles&#8221; that Kevin Muir has identified.

<li>Housing in the <span class="caps">UK</span> has been badly constructed for a long time.

<h1>Unemployment</h1>
<p>Unemployment is a terrible number to base a central bank policy on. It is the difference between two numbers: the number of people who they should be employable and the number of people who are actually&nbsp;employed. </p>

<h1>Wrap</h1>
<p>The markets are still buying the Fed line that inflation is not happening. 
Gold has had a terrible quarter, although it is up 1.32% today. 
In&nbsp;detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>$<span class="caps">QQQ</span> is up well over&nbsp;1%, </li>
<li>other <span class="caps">US</span> indices flat or slightly&nbsp;up,</li>
<li>very odd mix of sectors up: tech <span class="amp">&amp;</span> utilties, with consumer discretionary&nbsp;(motors),</li>
<li>value down (staples, industrials, real estate, and of course the hated energy sector plus banks): reflation trade dead (or&nbsp;dormant?),</li>
<li>global equity&nbsp;mixed,</li>
<li>bonds pretty flat: 10Y @&nbsp;1.73%,</li>
</ul>
<p>This was the end of the quarter. 28% corp. tax with measures to prevent offshoring of profits might dent the stockmarket, but it may never&nbsp;happen.</p>
<h1>Soapbox</h1>
<p>Economies benefit from rapid population growth. The Industrial Revolution, which delivered huge material gains to the mass of the population at the time, and even more to their descendants, was accompanied by a rising birthrate (and a declining infant mortality). Australia has enjoyed growth through immigration. Similarly <span class="caps">HK</span>, Singapore, <span class="caps">UK</span> (compared to neighbours). A young country is a productive country; short of forcing citizens to reproduce the only way to achieve this is to welcome&nbsp;immigrants. </p>
<p>There are many mechanisms for sharing the benefits of immigration with those who lose economically: older native workers, and the taxpayers of country of origin (who have paid for the training of all the Indian GPs who come to work in the <span class="caps">UK</span>). The ideal would be a market based one (e.g. a bidding system for visas, the proceeds of which would be paid to the originating country authorities) but the details are left to clever minds than mine.  We could restrict immigration to economically disadvantaged areas, which typically have plenty of schools and houses. There are lots of&nbsp;schemes.  </p>
<p>Obviously, there are political problems, but if we do not embrace immigration we will be poorer. If we choose to be poorer, well that&#8217;s democracy, but politicians should not be allowed to pretend things will be&nbsp;different.</p>
