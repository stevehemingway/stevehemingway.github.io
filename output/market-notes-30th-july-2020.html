<p><span class="caps">TL</span>;<span class="caps">DR</span>: none.
<span class="caps">DXY</span> short looks a bit over extended. <span class="caps">DX</span> future seems to be going up today. 
Probably a reversal, but I can understand the bull thesis.
As <span class="caps">DX</span> rises, commodity prices fall, in unison. This seems to have happened today, including precious metals.
<a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cYOCwZL9dy">This post from The (excellent) Market Ear</a> suggests that short <span class="caps">DX</span> may have gone on too long. 
The main point it makes, though, is that the Fed is, compared to the size of the pool of bonds it&#8217;s buying in, doing the least of the Fed, the BoE and the <span class="caps">ECB</span>. However, the long dated rates don&#8217;t seem to be rising&nbsp;much.</p>
<p>Generally, the intra-day swings seem higher, maybe because the breadth (propertion of the market moving together) has dropped.
The Fed announcement yesterday doesn&#8217;t seem to have had the (presumably) desired effect of spiking the market&nbsp;higher.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6cc1b28b-940c-4c7b-886d-a928d56b3efd">Diana Choyleva argues that this time is different for the Chinese stock market</a>. I am not so convinced.
There must be a ton of malinvestment in China, 
and converting a trillion <span class="caps">RMB</span> debt to equity cannot be bullish for share prices,
unless I&#8217;ve misunderstood something fundamental about supply and demand.
(Although I&#8217;d be the first to admit that shares are not widgets, in terms of the price vs supply&nbsp;behaviour.)</p>
<h2>Economic&nbsp;thoughts</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b6ad9b99-d75f-4ef9-9a88-852ce0de5f6b">This article by Robin Harding</a> argues that the Central Banks had no alternative to the policies they carried out since the 90&#8217;s, and that any negative collateral damage was preferable to allowing a real deep recession to arise from too tight a monetary policy.
The comments are more or less unanimous in disagreeing and several imply some sort of charm offensive by the CBs to get journalists to defend their actions in print. 
I wouldn&#8217;t go as far as this, but it&#8217;s gratifying that most of the commentators are of the opinion that CBs have made life a lot worse for the young.
It seems to me that if we don&#8217;t change <span class="caps">CB</span> policies, we need to introduce fiscal policies to compensate losers. 
The obvious policy is much higher capital taxes.
Any hint that this policy might be enacted would these will generate a very intense lobbying effort, so I am not&nbsp;hopeful.</p>
<p>I watched the final episode of the <span class="caps">TV</span> documentary series about the Murdoch dynasty last night.
He is a huge beneficiary of the desire of corporates to interfere in the political&nbsp;process.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, but plenty of people get rich by investing in&nbsp;them</h2>
<p><a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2020/07/28/my-favorite-ponzi-scheme/">Kuppy argues</a> that although Bitcoins are worth nothing (obvs) it is quite possible that one can make a ton of money by buying them. 
He talks about charts, fashion, liquidity of the asset, compares it to gold etc. etc.
I don&#8217;t know. There are an infinite perfectly viable substitutes for <span class="caps">BTC</span> (i.e. the &#8216;alt-coins&#8217; aka the &#8216;shitcoins&#8217;). However, <span class="caps">BTC</span> is the one that people seem to have faith in, and that&#8217;s what five pound notes have but Monopoly money does not have (outside a game), so it&#8217;s not to be sneezed at.
Would I buy $<span class="caps">GBTC</span>? Probably not, but at least I&#8217;d consider it. 
Two things worth considering though:
* Kuppy is probably only writing this now because he wants to close his own position (or go short), 
* Ponzi schemes can collapse faster than you can close your position, and liquidity can evaporate quicker than liquid nitrogen in a&nbsp;furnace.</p>
<p>Talking about Ponzi schemes, <a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/29/thezoohasgonenuts-kodak-after-crypto-scheme-in-2018-caused-its-stock-to-surge-300-before-recrashing-gets-trump-pump-worth-2190-before-recrashing/">Wolf nails it</a> in his account of what has been going on with Eastman Kodak ($<span class="caps">KODK</span>). &#8220;Nauseating&#8221; doesn&#8217;t even come close to what is going on&nbsp;here.</p>
<h2>India</h2>
<p>Narendra Modi has been a divisive prime minister of India. 
He has increasingly relied on mobilizing his base, rather than fixing the economy, to get re-elected.
This approach is not good for the economy of the country, a point made by Gavekal Research, referenced in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampesek/2020/07/29/indias-covid-19-fallout-collides-with-a-shaky-economy/#72cae9123684">this article</a>.
The level of infections is extremely high, so maybe India will the first country to hit herd immunity.
It&#8217;s a place worth watching.
The emerging market stockmarket I am most bearish about is China&#8217;s (including <span class="caps">HK</span>&#8217;s). 
I suspect that most Chinese stocks listed in the <span class="caps">US</span> have serious deficiencies in their statutory reporting,
but it&#8217;s extremely dangerous to short a Ponzi scheme, as recent stock market developments have&nbsp;shown.</p>
<h2>Late afternoon&nbsp;report</h2>
<p>Nothing much changed from this morning, except precious metals have retraced more.
Natural gas <span class="amp">&amp;</span> oil have lurched down, and brought down the tankers with it. 
This probably has a lot to do with Q2 <span class="caps">GDP</span> dropping by 33% (annualized).
This drop in <span class="caps">GDP</span> provoked a rare and dramatic plunge in the Nasdaq index, which was down 0.12% as I type this.
It&#8217;s hard to remember when the index dropped by so much, but I&#8217;m sure the <span class="caps">PPT</span> will make sure it is suitably pumped up overnight when volume is thin. 
The figures above were based on the nearby future&#8217;s price. Exposure to the index for most retail traders is via <span class="caps">QQQ</span> which, reassuringly, is still green on the day. Praise be the Fed! 
(More seriously) the explanation is that the expected drop in <span class="caps">GDP</span> was a bit worse, and the dollar is still going down, which inflates the dollar revenue figure for the FAANGs without hitting their (dollar denominated) cost base (much). Firms like Google must have something like the most geographically diversified income base on the&nbsp;planet.</p>
<p>Oddly, compared to other countries&#8217; reporting conventions, <span class="caps">US</span> economic figures are all reported as an annualized figure (i.e. the actual quarterly drop was multiplied by four to come up with the 33% drop). <a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/30/no-gdp-didnt-plunge-32-9-in-q2-it-plunged-a-still-terrible-9-5-time-to-kill-annual-rates/">Wolf is good on this too</a>.</p>
<p>Ten year <span class="caps">US</span> Treasury yields are down. Yet the stockmarket is up. What&#8217;s going on? One of them is mis-reading the economic situation. The <span class="caps">DAX</span> and <span class="caps">STOXX50</span> are down 3%. It&#8217;s all very&nbsp;odd. </p>
