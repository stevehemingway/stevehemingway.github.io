<h2>Corporatism</h2>
<p>A few commentators have been pointing out the collapse of capitalism into corporatism for years.
<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Saving-Capitalism-Capitalists-Unleashing-Opportunity/dp/0609610708">Zingales and Raghuram</a> did an excellent job.
<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Myth-Capitalism-Monopolies-Death-Competition/dp/1119548195">Tepper and Hearn</a> did a slightly less good job, but more readably.
<a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/">Matt Stoller</a> is doing a fabulous job, but against the massed forces of corporate America, the odds are heavily stacked against him.
The <span class="caps">CMA</span> (Competition and Markets Authority) is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/search/news-and-communications?parent=competition-and-markets-authority&amp;organisations%5B%5D=competition-and-markets-authority&amp;order=most-viewed">predictably ineffective</a>, tackling minor breaches but avoiding taking on any big industry with a high level of concentration (such as internet retail, credit card processing, government outsourcing, <span class="caps">FTSE</span>-100 auditing, housebuilding, building underwriting, casualty insurance, broadband infrastructure providers, off the top of my head, ignoring global monopolies such as internet search, smart phone operating&nbsp;systems). </p>
<p>What is weird is that no politician even acknowledges the existence of the problem. The Left seems to believe that capitalism is largely unchanged since Karl Marx was in his pomp and is the font and origin of all the ills of the world. The right seems to think it is similarly unchanged but that the competition delivers untold bounty to ordinary citizens, and that  “It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest. We address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages” is still a good description of how commerce&nbsp;operates.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is lobbying. The revelations in the wake of the Cameron-Greensill-Gupta Family Group fiasco gives a glimpse behind the curtain, and it is far from&nbsp;edifying. </p>
<h2><span class="caps">AML</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/04/12/the-war-against-money-laundering-is-being-lost?utm_campaign=the-economist-today&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=salesforce-marketing-cloud&amp;utm_term=2021-04-12&amp;utm_content=article-link-1&amp;etear=nl_today_1">A study published last year by Ronald Pol, a financial-crime expert, concluded that the global <span class="caps">AML</span> system could be “the world’s least effective policy experiment”, and that compliance costs for banks and other businesses could be more than 100 times higher than the amount of laundered loot&nbsp;seized.</a></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t suppose anyone is particularly surprised by this. Politicians pat themselves on the back, for passing laws that get approval from the <span class="caps">USA</span>. Bankers get a better barrier to entry (who wants to start a bank if you have to recruit hundreds of expensive <span class="caps">AML</span> compliance officers?). Corporate lawyers get extra fees for having to spend more hours finding the loopholes in the system (which their firms drafted in the first place). Oligarchs have their control of the distribution of dirty money strengthened. Retail bankers and lawyers get  some performative virtue signalling, playing their role in beating terrorism.  The police and other authorities get to claim that huge resource (conveniently not out of their budgets) are being spent on preventing money&nbsp;laundering. </p>
<h2>Low&nbsp;Volume</h2>
<p><img alt="c2a26182f5efd86b5febe9f8a2ae628a.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/c2a26182f5efd86b5febe9f8a2ae628a.png"></p>
<p>Volume is always in a single asset. People are always buying <em>something.</em> The problem is that they stop buying <span class="caps">SPX</span> and start buying <span class="caps">BTC</span>. 
Until they really need to keep their savings in something 100% liquid.
Risk asset levels are a measure of confidence in the&nbsp;future.</p>
<p><img alt="ea1064581910a447395c4f5e88f7fad9.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/ea1064581910a447395c4f5e88f7fad9.png"></p>
<p>This time is … the&nbsp;same?</p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>Generally another risk-on&nbsp;day.</p>
<ul>
<li>commodities, including gold, generally up. Food weaker than&nbsp;metals,</li>
<li><span class="caps">DXY</span> down,&nbsp;91.82,</li>
<li>equities making more all time highs: <span class="caps">NDX</span> up another&nbsp;1.2%,</li>
<li>Most momentum stocks up: $<span class="caps">TSLA</span> up&nbsp;8.5%,</li>
<li>10Y down to 1.62%, in spite of weak <span class="caps">DXY</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <span class="caps">BLS</span> announced that measured <span class="caps">CPI</span> was 2.6%, but the work done by Bullard yesterday neutralized any effect on the market.
There was a fairly strong auction for 30Y bonds, possibly&nbsp;yesterday.</p>
<h2>Twitter</h2>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">6 people in 6.8 million affected by this J&amp;J clotting issue<br><br>This whole pandemic has revealed how <span class="caps">AWFUL</span> governing bodies are at cost-benefit analysis (lockdowns,&nbsp;etc)</p>&mdash; EnergyCynic (@EnergyCynic) <a href="https://twitter.com/EnergyCynic/status/1381929361192984577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 13, 2021</a></blockquote>

<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s cost benefit. I think it&#8217;s the politician&#8217;s asymmetrical&nbsp;incentives. </p>
