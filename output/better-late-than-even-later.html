<p>(I was out yesterday, this is written way after the close of markets, but I add it for&nbsp;completeness.)</p>
<ul>
<li>commodities largely flat. Precious metals&nbsp;steady/rising,</li>
<li>bonds&nbsp;flat,</li>
<li><span class="caps">DX</span> sagging a bit,&nbsp;91.7,</li>
<li>equities generally grinding higher, but nothing&nbsp;dramatic.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Nexhealth, Plaid (nothing to do with&nbsp;Tesla)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/the-secret-3-step-master-plan-to">Packy McCormack writes about <span class="caps">API</span>-first&nbsp;companies.</a></p>
<p>Code is powerful, but that power comes only when there is something to connect it to.
When I was a programmer, I spent some time writing screen drivers, i.e. a set of calls to allow an application program to make things happen on the monitor in front of him.
Now, companies are employing people to write code to make things happen in their real life: e.g. taking money from their bank account to put it into securities. This sort of thing is difficult because real life was never designed to be driven by&nbsp;software.</p>
<p>Anyway, read the piece. It&#8217;s excellent.
Stripe is a wonderful company. It looks as though these two have the potential to emulate&nbsp;it.</p>
<h2>The West, in opposition to communism, has become&nbsp;fascist</h2>
<p>“Fascism should more properly be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power.” — Benito&nbsp;Mussolini</p>
<p>It is generally attributed to an article written by Mussolini in the 1932 Enciclopedia Italiana with the assistance of Giovanni Gentile, the&nbsp;editor.</p>
<p>https://www.politicalresearch.org/2005/01/12/mussolini-corporate-state</p>
<h2>Banks stress test results out&nbsp;today</h2>
<p>Everyone is expecting that, backstopped by the Fed, the banks will be able to pay out much more capital than previously.
It&#8217;s not obvious how a change of capital structure will change the valuation of the enterprise (didn&#8217;t two academic economists get a Nobel Prize for saying that?), but it seems that it&nbsp;does.</p>
<h2>It&#8217;s a guilty pleasure of mine to read <span class="caps">RT</span></h2>
<p>It&#8217;s normally pretty mainstream, but 
<a href="https://www.rt.com/op-ed/527300-blackstone-asset-stripping-realestate-ripoff/">this article about Blackstone buying up housing assets in the <span class="caps">US</span></a> really goes for the&nbsp;jugular.</p>
<p>It seems to me that there is a very tilted playing field involved here. 
Blackstone can access funds at a few basis points. 
The precariat is having to borrow from credit card companies at 30% (i.e. 3,000bp). 
The higher rate is to compensate the lender for the credit risk. 
But the high rate is itself the cause of that&nbsp;risk!</p>
<p><span class="caps">OK</span>, people do not buy houses on a credit card, but when people are buyers, their liabilities may push their marginal cost of funds to these levels. 
Once they have received the &#8216;black spot&#8217; of having an impaired credit score, their sins can never be&nbsp;expunged.</p>
<h2>No we&nbsp;can&#8217;t!</h2>
<p>I believe that EVs need about 0.3 kWh per mile to travel. 
I don&#8217;t know if the other figures here are right, but they don&#8217;t sound&nbsp;wild.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the end of 2020, the United States had 1,117,475 <span class="caps">MW</span>—or about 1.12 billion kilowatts (kW)—of total utility-scale electricity generating capacity and about 27,724 <span class="caps">MW</span>—or nearly 0.03 billion kW—of small-scale solar photovoltaic electricity generating&nbsp;capacity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>from&nbsp;https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/electricity-in-the-us-generation-capacity-and-sales.php</p>
<p>It seems intuitively obvious that to replace the energy distribution capability of petrol and diesel in a country, the electricity generation capacity is going to be massively ramped&nbsp;up.</p>
