</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Wolf Richer, who I&#8217;ve found particularly enlightening of late, has announced that he&#8217;s gone short of <span class="caps">SPX</span> <a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/06/19/i-who-hates-shorting-just-shorted-the-entire-stock-market-heres-why/#comment-266929">
I, Who Hates Shorting, Just Shorted the Entire Stock Market. Here’s Why </a>.
I wish him luck. It&#8217;s very hard to make money by shorting.
You&#8217;d generally do a lot better by selecting an investment <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/daytrading-icon-portnoy-now-using-random-scrabble-letters-pick-stock">by drawing random Scrabble letters</a>. 
But we&#8217;ve got to such a crazy state of the market, with the Nasdaq hitting all time highs as <span class="caps">US</span> unemployment is about to hit 20%, that it has to make sense, even if I&#8217;m too chicken to do&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><a href="creditbubblebulletin.blogspot.com/2020/06/weekly-commentary-update-covid-19.html">The Credit Bubble Bulletin</a>, in spite of it&#8217;s low-tech web presence, is a great summary of what has been happening in the markets over the previous week.
It produces a new report every day, but only in link form. Doug Noland, the author brings everything together in a text report every week. 
The interesting thing about last week was how uninteresting it was. Neither equity nor <span class="caps">FI</span> markets budged very much.
Covid is still a serious problem.
Economic stats are still full of doom and gloom, although slightly less of these than in the recent past.
A lot of people are saying that we&#8217;re at a turning point. It&#8217;s certainly the case that for smooth functions,
the extremum is characterized by the rate of change dropping to zero.
Even if this is true, there is still time to act.
I am still cross about Wirecard, or more specifically that although I almost knew it was a Ponzi scheme, I made a lot less money out of it than the bulls. I think it has gone down, but in this market it will probably end up 
as one of <a href="https://www.barstoolbets.com/topics/davey-day-trader-global">Davey Day Trader Global</a> picks from his bag of Scrabble letters, and shoot back&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>In this market, it seems safe to keep out, or at best sell some vol, hedging out the equity&nbsp;exposure.</p>
<p>John Bolton&#8217;s book got a lot of coverage in the weekend papers.
How anyone can think it&#8217;s news that someone close to Trump has concluded that he&#8217;s stunningly ignorant
and unsuited to be the <span class="caps">POTUS</span> is beyond me. 
How John Bolton could have been unaware of this before he accepted the job of <span class="caps">US</span> National Security Advisor is also beyond&nbsp;me.</p>
