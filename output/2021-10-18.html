<h2>title: Theranos v2.0
status: published
date: 18 Oct&nbsp;2021</h2>
<h1>18&nbsp;Oct</h1>
<h2>Theranos&nbsp;2.0</h2>
<p><a href="https://elmerspud.substack.com/p/theranos-20-either-the-next-tesla?r=nmbt&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=">Yes, Liz Holmes idea rises again!</a>
Well, Marx said that history repeats itself, first as tragedy, the second as&nbsp;farce.</p>
<h2><span class="caps">US</span> Housing Market due for a&nbsp;correction</h2>
<p><a href="https://calculatedrisk.substack.com/p/will-4-mortgage-rates-halt-the-housing?r=nmbt&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=">Bill McBride cites Ivy Zelman&#8217;s view</a> that house prices are close to a turning point.
Housing, is the biggest asset class on the planet.
When it falls, other asset classes are caught in the downdraft.
People who need homes to live in, on the other hand, are better off.
All asset price movements have distributional effects.
Housing probably has the largest.
For every over-extended householder who loses his home, someone who could not previously afford to buy is presented with an&nbsp;opportunity.</p>
<h2>MaxLinear – looking like it&#8217;s going down&nbsp;exponentially</h2>
<p>Jehoshaphat Research <a href="https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlUM1uhCAQfprlaBhA1AOHXnrosS9gEGZXUkUj427t03dcEzLABzPfT_CEj2U73LoUEmfp6VjRZXyVCYlwE3vBrU_RAUglVS2iMxHauhWp9PcNcfZpcrTtKNZ9mFLwlJZ8NijbqlaMLvpQ69g0UYWAaojaDl30nfJ1a6028qL1e0yYA7olT8d7sJjcSLSWm_64qU9e9EqnoiosM9--cFzK6NfR03cJIyOFPO2FD2BM00mwFjow0ILVtUiO1bMHaMBorpWqoFNSwl3z10Y3Uldd_ht-FaibkfNDVWUfeGT4OQnF5grhE_mJkeLnN8iOe97nPSc6esx-mDBeYdAV6Tue_oEZN4469p4cyzGmBamhs_VlntMyihUo2whmjQt3ZUcjDui34J_4D8wci0s">published</a> on <strong>MaxLinear</strong> (<span class="caps">NYSE</span>: <span class="caps">MXL</span> — $3.70 billion), a California-based communications hardware company. Jehoshaphat called MaxLinear a “$4bn rollup of melting ice cubes.” Jehoshaphat alleged the company got a one-time <span class="caps">COVID</span> boost and that the company’s organic growth is actually flat. In addition, the company’s <span class="caps">CEO</span> has sold more stock in the past 12 months than in the preceding six years combined. Jehoshaphat&nbsp;wrote,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We’ve dissected <span class="caps">MXL</span>’s acquisition history and found a consistent template: acquire declining asset, exceed short-term expectations with sudden, short-lived surges of growth from said asset, and then suffer the predictable evaporation of that&nbsp;growth.”</p>

<h2><span class="caps">ED</span> Curve taking a&nbsp;beating</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/in-to-the-fall/">Alex Manzara&#8217;s weekly comment is worth reading.</a> He flags up that the <span class="caps">ED</span> futures market is pricing in some actual interest rate &#8216;hikes&#8217; in the next year or so.
I have read a half a dozen email newsletters this morning all talking about how inflation is actually not transitory, and that it&#8217;s becoming embedded.
I really think that now absolutely everyone is talking about price increases for basically everything that we are no longer turning&nbsp;Japanese.</p>
<h2>Deficit&nbsp;Myths</h2>
<p>There is a battle royal going on in Washington <span class="caps">DC</span> over the Biden Build Back Better Bill.
I don&#8217;t follow politics that closely, but I have noticed how the <span class="caps">USA</span> tends to set the agenda for the <span class="caps">UK</span> in terms of policies.
It&#8217;s almost as if <span class="caps">UK</span> politicians can&#8217;t read French or German and therefore focus on the foreign policy news which is easiest for them to digest,
but I digress. The point is that more and more activists are saying that this spend can be afforded.
There are a lot of angles along which this attack can be lined up. <a href="https://robertreich.substack.com/p/the-we-cant-afford-it-bullsht?r=nmbt&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=">Robert Reich&#8217;s latest substack</a> focusses on the Trump tax cuts and tax avoidance practiced by the ultra wealthy.
Others focus on the effectiveness of pandemic spending, and the absence of bad side effects.
The hidden support, I think, is <span class="caps">MMT</span>. Reich must certainly be aware of it, but probably thinks it&#8217;s too heretical to use an argument.
The right has never been afraid of deficits: Reagan&#8217;s success was built on deficit spending. Dick Cheney said &#8220;Reagan proved that deficits don&#8217;t matter.&#8221; I think he was talking about electoral success, but maybe he was talking about the health of the economy but most politicians think the two are interchangeable&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>Will this attitude leak into <span class="caps">UK</span> politics? I think so. Boris Johnson knows that if deficits do matter, they matter to the next administration. Rishi Sunak probably thinks that he has a good shot at being the next administration, so is more focussed on jam tomorrow. But Johnson has the whip hand, and has no reason to sacrifice his approval ratings in order to boost Sunak&#8217;s, so I think that by hook or by crook the autumn budget will be light on taxes and heavy on spending which, just to be clear, I would love to&nbsp;see.</p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>Industrial production was held down in September by shortages of everything, but still showed a positive quarter on quarter growth, for the fifth successive quarter.
Commodities were pretty flat.
Bonds were down a tiny bit, reflecting an increased conviction that rate rises are coming.
There was a massive short squeeze on $<span class="caps">THG</span>:<span class="caps">LSE</span>, up over 20%.
$<span class="caps">BTC</span> has had a fantastic run, at over $61K, showing that sentiment is still positive.
Eurodollar futures were down earlier on, but recovered later.
Uranium had a good day. Several governments seem to have realized that fission is the only practical solution for base-load electricity.
My personal view is that high-level waste could be encased in lead and used as a long-term heat&nbsp;source.</p>
