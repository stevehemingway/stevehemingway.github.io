<p>These guys just pile in on high short-interest stocks to pop them higher. Current targets are <span class="caps">GME</span>, <span class="caps">AMC</span>, <span class="caps">BB</span>, <span class="caps">BBY</span>, <span class="caps">NOK</span>.
<span class="caps">AMC</span> <span class="caps">IV</span> is 392%! 
This is kind of insane, but fascinating. 
At some point there will be a day of reckoning, but with <span class="caps">AMC</span> up 11% in pre-market I&#8217;m not going to bet against it.
If you want some ideas, try <a href="https://www.lowfloat.com/">lowfloat stocks</a> or <a href="https://www.highshortinterest.com/all/">high short interest stocks</a>. <em>Not investment&nbsp;advice!</em></p>

<h1>Pandemic drives&nbsp;inequality</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/rustandy/blog/2020/coronavirus-impacts-on-american-households">Nothing suprising there</a> but will this translate into more&nbsp;stimulus?</p>
<h1><span class="caps">US</span> Residential is a&nbsp;buy</h1>

<p>Available stock is at very low levels.
Probably immigration will pick up.
Maybe a post-pandemic baby&nbsp;boom?</p>
<h1>Kiss goodbye to closing the&nbsp;deficit</h1>

<h1>Bubbles</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The 5 major financial bubbles since the 18th century have seen their relevant asset class rise by an average of 1400% before the crash. So, do not worry, if your particular position is not up 1400% yet you are fine, nothing bad will happen - just keep on&nbsp;buying.</p>

<p>Citi:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="caps">CITI</span> strategist sees a bubble, (perhaps) but argues it can get much bigger. It is a new chapter in the &#8220;bubble bubble but absolutely no trouble&#8221; book that the market currently is writing. <span class="caps">CITI</span>: &#8220;Global equities are looking increasingly frothy, but current performance and valuations still lag previous mega-bubbles. The <span class="caps">NASDAQ</span> now trades on a <span class="caps">CAPE</span> of 58x compared to 113x in 2000, and Japan’s 83x in 1990. Investors worried about excess valuation should look outside <span class="caps">US</span> equities. And there is no bubble versus bonds. Past equity bubbles hit much higher valuations than now, but with bonds at 5-6% not 0-1%. Bonds were an obvious alternative once those bubbles burst. They are not now. And bubbles don’t burst easily. Perhaps equities are currently vulnerable to any hints of higher rates or <span class="caps">QE</span> tapering from central banks. But history suggests that bubbles can inflate even as rates start to rise. They are much more robust than we all&nbsp;think&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Even Goldman thinks that things have got&nbsp;bubbly:</p>

<h1>European cheap labour in the <span class="caps">UK</span></h1>
<p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/eb5e3bd7-c8bf-4934-b60e-0e49152183a5">This article by Sarah O&#8217;Connor</a> explains why it&#8217;s perfectly rational for <span class="caps">UK</span> workers to choose not to do the work that is normally done by seasonal migrant fruit and veg. pickers who have previously come to the <span class="caps">UK</span>. 
It&#8217;s not so difficult to&nbsp;understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>the minimum wage means that you have to pick damn fast to be worth&nbsp;employing,</li>
<li>if you are Bulgarian, you can spend half your year in a very cheap&nbsp;place, </li>
<li>you have to work long hours and weekends, but have six months off: this just doesn&#8217;t suit&nbsp;locals,</li>
<li>you may have to move from farm to farm, living in very basic (but free) accommodation on the&nbsp;farm,</li>
<li>the economics of food production in the <span class="caps">UK</span>, plus the political allergy to having rapidly increasing food prices mean that this is just always going to be a tough gig, compared to being an estate&nbsp;agent.</li>
</ul>
<p>I saved this outside the paywall <a href="https://termbin.com/adxn">here</a>. It will disappear in a month or so. Sorry, <span class="caps">FT</span>.</p>
<h1>Fame at&nbsp;last!</h1>
<p><a href="https://thesoundingline.com/">The Sounding Line</a> gave me a shout-out <a href="https://thesoundingline.com/what-drives-commodity-inflation/">here</a>. Taps Coogan is always worth reading. And it&#8217;s free (donation encouraged). I strongly suggest you check it&nbsp;out.</p>
<h1>Wrap</h1>
<p>Basically, fairly risk neutral. 
Core Eurozone yields crammed down, <span class="caps">US</span> <span class="amp">&amp;</span> <span class="caps">UK</span> pretty flat, <span class="caps">EM</span> going up.
Everything else&nbsp;unremarkable.</p>
<p>$<span class="caps">GME</span>  up 92%.&nbsp;Insane.</p>
