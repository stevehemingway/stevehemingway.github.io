</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h1>The day in&nbsp;review</h1>
<h2>Markets</h2>
<p><span class="caps">US</span> markets are trading at or close to all-time highs. 
This is accounted for&nbsp;by:</p>
<ul>
<li>unprecedented fiscal stimulus, including budget deficits of the sort that are barely seen in times of&nbsp;war,</li>
<li>repression of interest rates to the point that real returns on any sovereign credit is significantly&nbsp;negative,</li>
<li>a very successful development of a vaccine and a strong recovery in economic activity after an artificial suppression of economic&nbsp;activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem is that all these supporting factors are in the past. It&#8217;s hard to see how they can be sustained or repeated.
At some point governments will have to raise taxes. Even the <span class="caps">MMT</span> Mafia agree that taxes must be levied to drain liquidity once inflation starts to be felt. If 4.2% is not inflation, what is? If the time to increase taxes is not now, when is&nbsp;it?</p>
<p>However, today saw a strong reversal of the stock market falls of yesterday, dropping of yields, and reversing of the upward move in the dollar yesterday. The <span class="caps">EUR</span> was back where it was last November, at <span class="caps">USD</span>&nbsp;1.21.</p>
<p>Commodities were generally weak, dragged down by oil, down 3.5% by the close; maybe the restarting of the Colonial Pipeline had an&nbsp;impact.</p>
<p>European shares were generally&nbsp;down.</p>
<p>Drivers of today&#8217;s move presumably include, <em>inter alia</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="caps">CDC</span> says fully vaccinated people can remove masks for most&nbsp;activities </li>
<li>Weekly initial claims reach a new post-pandemic low, to 473K (expected&nbsp;490K), </li>
</ul>
<h2>Can&#8217;t fill jobs, won&#8217;t raise&nbsp;wages</h2>
<p>Employers prefer complaining to govt. to actually paying workers more wages,&nbsp;understandably.</p>
<p><img alt="According to the NFIB survey, the share of firms having difficulty filling positions rose in April to a record high. While the share planning to raise compensation also rose, it remains lower than it was before the pandemic. Unless firms’ wage plans grow, the upcoming rise in inflation is likely to be transient, as the Fed is claiming." src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0e1212c3-52a2-4c82-9531-a00dd98de054_498x282.png"></p>

<h2>Interesting&nbsp;podcast</h2>
<p><a href="https://shows.acast.com/rodcast">The Rodcast</a> is a podcast, hosted by Rod. 
Well, everyone has one these days.
But if you&#8217;re in the <span class="caps">UK</span> and interested in property development or financing, it&#8217;s worth listening to.
I&#8217;d particularly recommend <a href="https://shows.acast.com/rodcast/episodes/financing-developments-with-ian-humphreys-brickflow">this one</a>, as the guest explains why it&#8217;s so difficult to get financing in the <span class="caps">UK</span> because of it&#8217;s desperately slow, low-tech process for creating&nbsp;credit.</p>
