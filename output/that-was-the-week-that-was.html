<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>This was a risk-on equity day.
The major <span class="caps">US</span> indices surged (<span class="caps">NDX</span> up 3.15%).
Most other stuff was quiet, although nat. gas continues to zoom up.
<span class="caps">FX</span> and bonds subdued.
Some very good results from $<span class="caps">AAPL</span> and $<span class="caps">VISA</span> were the drivers of the equity outperformance.
Arguably, these stocks are not representative of the broader&nbsp;market.</p>
<p>It feels as though the market is underpricing the risks of a Russian invasion of Ukraine 
and the removal of the <span class="caps">UK</span> prime minister, as well as political disruption in&nbsp;France.</p>
<p>Biden seems unable or unwilling to coordinate the west&#8217;s response to Russia&#8217;s aggression,
which surely spells more of&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The continued strength of the oil price is surly going to keep inflation high, 
whatever Powell does with interest&nbsp;rates.</p>
<p>Generally, western governments seem to become increasingly unable to get buy-in from their voters,
who now see them as all in the pockets of plutocrats. We are all becoming&nbsp;Africans.</p>
