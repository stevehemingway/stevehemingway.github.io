<h1>Wrap</h1>
<p>The Senate runoff elections in <span class="caps">GA</span> will determine whether or not  Biden&#8217;s progressive policies will be blocked by Mitch McConnell, the Nosferatu of the Senate. If the Democrats manage to take both seats from the incumbents, we&#8217;re much more likely to see progressive, fiscally relaxed, policy being passed into law, and with it a much increased chance of&nbsp;inflation.</p>
<p>Today was solidly risk&nbsp;on:</p>
<ul>
<li>equities up, with the exception of a few <span class="caps">EU</span>&nbsp;markets,</li>
<li>all equity sectors up, especially&nbsp;energy,</li>
<li>value and small cap outperforming&nbsp;growth,</li>
<li>Canadian and <span class="caps">UK</span> longer dated yields up&nbsp;significantly,</li>
<li>nearly all IPOs are above their issue price (a notable exception is Casper Sleep: a mattress&nbsp;seller),</li>
<li><span class="caps">USD</span> looking weak again, especially against commodity currencies <span class="caps">AUD</span> and <span class="caps">CAD</span> (fairly flat against <span class="caps">EUR</span>),</li>
<li>The vast majority of major currencies now have policy rates of 0.25% or less (policy rate: e.g. Fed Funds, discount rate etc., I know these are variously&nbsp;implemented),</li>
<li>virtually all commodities are up. <span class="caps">NG</span> is up&nbsp;6.5%!</li>
<li>all govt. bonds are down, yields up. $<span class="caps">TLT</span> (20yr + <span class="caps">ETF</span>) is down 0.84% this month&nbsp;alone,</li>
</ul>
<h1>Thoughts</h1>
<p>In the <span class="caps">UK</span>, the Conservative govt. has always maintained the position that, in one of the few memorable words of Mrs May, &#8220;There is no magic money tree.&#8221;
The truth is, of course, that there is. And its fruit has been abundant, easily enough to cover the cost of shutting down the economy, without any signs of a sterling crisis or material impact on gilt yields.
Young people want money, to pay for their education (especially &#8216;Uni&#8217;), free stuff, like healthcare, and carbon emission reduction. Politicians want their votes, and now that both they and the voters have realized that you can have the penny and the bun, they want the voters to have more&nbsp;buns.</p>
<p>Actions have consequences. Fortunately, in politics these come with (usually) long and variable lags. The Covid crisis has demonstrated that the government can enable major shifts in behaviour, not just temporarily, but almost permanently.
Banning air travel, stopping people driving their cars, making them work remotely using technology, are now things. Things that the population can be made to do, and made to continue doing. No longer will Permanent Secretaries be able to argue that any attempt to make large-scale changes to individual behaviour to fix the climate would be nice but in a free country like the <span class="caps">UK</span> would be simply impossible to&nbsp;enforce.</p>
<p>Maybe the conservative instincts of the Conservatives will prevent this getting too out of control, but as the principle is conceded, the pressure to do more will spiral upwards, until either all their inhibitions are cast aside, or they are replace by a Labour administration with&nbsp;none.</p>
<p>I certainly hope so, if only to know what the out turn will&nbsp;be.</p>
