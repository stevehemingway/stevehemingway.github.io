</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h1>Planning&nbsp;Matters</h1>
<p>Several significant applications are due to be considered by the <span class="caps">KPC</span>
Planning Committee on 13<sup>th</sup> October. Please submit your
comments to <span class="caps">NHDC</span> before the deadline if you have views, and/or raise
them with the <span class="caps">KPC</span> Planning Committee. As in all Parish and District
Council meetings, members of the public are welcome to attend committee&nbsp;meetings:</p>
<p><strong>Knebworth <span class="caps">GP</span> Surgery</strong>: An application has been made for 1 Stevenage
Road a proposal for eight one-bedroom flats on the site of the Knebworth
<span class="caps">GP</span> Surgery – the deadline for comments to be made to <span class="caps">NHDC</span> is
9<sup>th</sup> October, and as <span class="caps">HCC</span> is responsible for the provision of
the <span class="caps">GP</span> surgeries, Knebworth’s <span class="caps">HCC</span> representative, Cllr Richard Thake, is
fully&nbsp;involved.</p>
<p><strong>Solar Farms</strong>: At its last planning meeting <span class="caps">KPC</span> objected to the
proposed Swangley’s Lane Solar Farm, having had extensive discussion and
views expressed by residents, other members of the public and the
developer, and will be considering a second solar farm at Crouch Green,
on Three Houses Lane (deadline 16<sup>th</sup> October).</p>
<p><strong>Knebworth Park Cricket Club</strong>: An amended application is due to be
considered (deadline 30<sup>th</sup> October).</p>
<p><strong>Other residential</strong>: A new application for the Bulwer Lytton House
site in Lytton Fields (deadline 16<sup>th</sup> October) and an
application for proposed development at 111 London Road will also be&nbsp;considered.</p>
<h1><span class="caps">NHDC</span> – Capital and Grant Funding&nbsp;Awards</h1>
<p>Two awards of additional funding have been made by <span class="caps">NHDC</span>&nbsp;committees:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A grant of &pound;7,000 has been awarded to Knebworth Parish Council by
    the <span class="caps">NHDC</span> Rural Community Halls Capital Fund. This will allow a major
    upgrade to the heating system in the Village Hall, just in time for
    the cold winter&nbsp;months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Knebworth Day Centre for the vulnerable and elderly received a
    boost when it received a grant of &pound;1,000 from <span class="caps">NHDC</span>’s Southern Rural
    Area Committee to help with operational costs. Knebworth Day Centre,
    a not-for-profit organisation staffed by ten volunteers, has
    provided social activities for elderly and frail people for 25
    years, and currently around 15 members meet every Monday from 10am
    to&nbsp;3pm.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Parking – Proposals for Further&nbsp;Restrictions</h1>
<p>I hope that some of you were able to attend the meeting in the Village
Hall on 23<sup>rd</sup> September when proposals to introduce further
parking restrictions in Pondcroft Road, Milestone Road, Deanscroft, Gun
Lane, Gun Road and (to a minor extent) Station Road. There is also a
proposal, although at an earlier stage, to introduce parking
restrictions in Watton Road. Full details are available in the Library
or on the Parish Council and <span class="caps">NHDC</span> websites. Please be quick as the
deadline for comments is 3rd October – you can email comments to
<a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#116;&#114;&#97;&#110;&#115;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#64;&#110;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#104;&#45;&#104;&#101;&#114;&#116;&#115;&#46;&#103;&#111;&#118;&#46;&#117;&#107;">&#116;&#114;&#97;&#110;&#115;&#112;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#64;&#110;&#111;&#114;&#116;&#104;&#45;&#104;&#101;&#114;&#116;&#115;&#46;&#103;&#111;&#118;&#46;&#117;&#107;</a>.</p>
<h1>Norton Green&nbsp;Common</h1>
<p>Fly Tipping and illegal access to the <span class="caps">SSSI</span> on the Common continues to be
a problem. Representatives of Natural England and <span class="caps">HCC</span> have just been out
to look at the tipping and have proposed a solution to restrict access
on the Common by introducing bollards right along up to the beginning of
the <span class="caps">SSSI</span>. Knebworth Estates have agreed pay for the bollards as they
will also stop access to their woodland, which has suffered from fly
tipping in the&nbsp;past.</p>
