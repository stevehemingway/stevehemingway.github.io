</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h1>Station Pub Planning Application (Ref&nbsp;17/01622/1)</h1>
<p>It was good to see the support at the Pop Up Pub in the village hall last month, held as part of the <span class="caps">SOSPUB</span> Campaign (see photo). The planning application for the Station Pub, which retains a pub but includes development of part of the site into flats, is still to come before the <span class="caps">NHDC</span> Planning Control Committee, this month’s meeting is on Thursday 15th March,&nbsp;7.30pm.</p>
<h1>Changes to brown bin&nbsp;service</h1>
<p>You should all have received a leaflet about changes to the waste and recycling services being made in May. The leaflet is available on <span class="caps">NHDC</span>’s website: <a href="http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/gardenwaste">www.north-herts.gov.uk/gardenwaste</a> and this page is also the one to sign up through if you wish to use the brown bin&nbsp;service.</p>
<p>To keep costs to a minimum <span class="caps">NHDC</span> is asking everyone who can to use the online option, but <em>you can pay by phone</em> via the general number, 01462 474000, and selecting waste services. The cost is £40 a year for one bin, with an early bird discount of £35 available if you sign up by the end of March. Payment can be by debit or credit&nbsp;card.</p>
<h1><span class="caps">NHDC</span> Budget&nbsp;2018-19</h1>
<p>The budget for 2018-19 was agreed at the full council meeting held in February. Total net budgeted expenditure will be £14.6m. To give some context, in 2010, total net spend for <span class="caps">NHDC</span> was running at £18m. Throughout the long march to reduce costs, the focus for <span class="caps">NHDC</span> has been to protect front-line services: those which directly affect residents of North Herts.
Of the £14.6m net expenditure, Council Tax will pay for the lion&#8217;s share, £11m, and the rest comes from Business Rates and New Homes Bonus. There are considerable increased costs flowing through as a result of various inflationary and contractual&nbsp;increases.</p>
<p>Offsetting these increases are savings, primarily from the new Waste Collection and Street Cleaning contract which covers all the services the council must provide as a statutory obligation. This is around £2m per annum cheaper than the current one with Veolia, which has been running for 14 years, and some additional savings are expected in&nbsp;2019-20.</p>
<p>The result of all this effort is that the increase in Council Tax for next year will be £6.49 for a Band D property for the year, to £223.45. Your total Council Tax bill is much higher than this as <span class="caps">NHDC</span> collects the tax on behalf of Herts County Council, the Herts Police, and Knebworth Parish&nbsp;Council.</p>
