<h2>What will Europe do with no Russian&nbsp;gas?</h2>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;re about to experience a sovereign debt crisis caused by the Europe energy crisis, all a capstone on the 100 year fiat expirement. <br><br>Here&#39;s how I think the next 6-8 months go down: <a href="https://t.co/vxCkB2WSR4">pic.twitter.com/vxCkB2WSR4</a></p>&mdash; fejau (@fejau_inc) <a href="https://twitter.com/fejau_inc/status/1566657303784263681?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2022</a></blockquote>

<p>This guy seems to have a compelling story. 
Democratic governments will have no option but to print money to give subsidies to consumers (residential and business) of energy.
This will drag down the euro, and euro-area bonds.
The spike in the dollar will crash emerging market economies, and cause defaults on their bonds. In the run-up, these governments will sell <span class="caps">US</span> Treasuries which will push up <span class="caps">US</span> yields even further, in the face of a rising&nbsp;dollar.</p>
<p>@fejau_inc also speculates that the Fed will do all it can to hold down the rise of the dollar by buying <span class="caps">EUR</span> and <span class="caps">JPY</span> via central bank swap lines. They are already worried about maintaining liquidity with commercial bank counterparties (see quoted tweet from @deltaone). The next step is complicated, as he concedes. Either the Fed will pivot, drive down rates to zero one more time and re-inflate the bond bubble, or we&#8217;ll get financial Armaggedon. He inclines to the latter course, but as Kashkari points out, the Fed can print infinite numbers of dollars, and people want&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>He also thinks that even though the dollar will go up, so will oil. Given the dire (downward) performance of oil prices lately, that&#8217;s a bold call. I can believe that oil priced in yen will spike, but in <span class="caps">USD</span>? I&#8217;m not so&nbsp;sure.</p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>The dollar strength seems to be the leitmotif of today. <span class="caps">DXY</span> was up another 0.6% to 110.22. This drove down everything, including nearly all equity markets and all commodities. (A few odd ones, like coal were up, but to a good first approx.) 
<span class="caps">US</span> yields were up, i.e. bonds were down, in spite of the tightening effect of a higher dollar on the <span class="caps">US</span>&nbsp;economy. </p>
<h2>In the&nbsp;news</h2>
<p>All from <a href="http://oilprice.com/">Oilprice.com</a> Intelligence Report newsletter (free,&nbsp;daily): </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shell and Exxon Put Up Europe’s Largest Gas Field for Sale. The <span class="caps">UK</span>’s Shell (<span class="caps">LON</span>:<span class="caps">SHEL</span>) and <span class="caps">U.S.</span> major ExxonMobil (<span class="caps">NYSE</span>:<span class="caps">XOM</span>) decided to sell their jointly owned <span class="caps">NAM</span> venture in the Netherlands, among others operator of the supergiant Groningen gas field that is mandated to shut (by government decree) in&nbsp;2024. </p>
<p><span class="caps">OPEC</span>+ is reimagining its role in the oil markets and even though its promise of a tiny cut certainly does not impress outright, one should never underestimate the geopolitical symbolism of its actions. By signaling that the oil group is eager to make swift changes in case geopolitical realities change (ehm, Iran), the lower October production target is also a mirror into the Middle Eastern psyche – as oil started moving closer to the fiscal breakeven levels of Saudi Arabia or Iraq, maintaining crude prices within the $90-100 per barrel bandwidth will remain a top item on the <span class="caps">OPEC</span>+&nbsp;agenda.   </p>
<p><em><strong><span class="caps">OPEC</span>+ Brings End to Era of Production Hikes.</strong></em> <span class="caps">OPEC</span>+ <a href="https://oilprice.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ed58b19f2b88e4a743b950765&amp;id=b88a5fb948&amp;e=bb98728959" title="https://oilprice.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ed58b19f2b88e4a743b950765&amp;id=b88a5fb948&amp;e=bb98728959">agreed</a> to cut collective output by 100,000 b/d, reversing the oil group’s decision from last month, marking the first month in more than two years when they curb production targets amidst unprecedented price&nbsp;volatility.   </p>
<p><em><strong>Iran Talks ‘In Danger’ Again.</strong></em> The <span class="caps">EU</span>’s chief negotiator in the nuclear talks with Iran, Josep Borrell, <a href="https://oilprice.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ed58b19f2b88e4a743b950765&amp;id=e9114f17a0&amp;e=bb98728959" title="https://oilprice.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ed58b19f2b88e4a743b950765&amp;id=e9114f17a0&amp;e=bb98728959">stated</a> that the negotiations are in danger as Washington and Tehran started diverging on several contested points, most notably guarantees that the <span class="caps">US</span> cannot withdraw unilaterally again from the <span class="caps">JCPOA</span>.</p>

<h2>Freerange&nbsp;rant</h2>
<p>I love to read Rudy Havenstein. He despises the system which allows Wall Street to run the <span class="caps">USA</span> while the rest of the population thinks they have a say, like Truman Burbank in <em>The Truman Show</em>. 
His real <em>bête noire</em> is Jamie Dimon. 
<a href="https://rudy.substack.com/p/turn-off-your-tape-recorder">Turn off your tape&nbsp;recorders.</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s fun to read this stuff, but like the saying goes, &#8220;Don&#8217;t get mad. Get even!&#8221; Havenstein keeps pointing out how terrible this stuff is, but nobody is seriously proposing a revolution, which (surely) is the only way to change the&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, I don&#8217;t ascribe the sort of evil motives to people like Dimon and Blankfein and (Hank) Paulson. They just act rationally. The problem is that politics is so easy to manipulate that I am not sure any person in their position could resist the temptation to rig the&nbsp;system.</p>
