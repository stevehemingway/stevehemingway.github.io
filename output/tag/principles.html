</footer><!-- /.post-info --><h2>Focus on controlling&nbsp;losses</h2>
<p>In trading, it&#8217;s very important to anticipate what will happen, and avoid even thinking about what should happen. 
Even if you can&#8217;t help thinking about what should happen, and are seduced into action by the thought,
at least have the humility to reverse your action when the market says that you are wrong. 
And, remember, being too early is just another way of being wrong. 
It can take the market a long time to start to act&nbsp;rationally.</p>
<p>It finally occurred to me that maybe <strong>studying losses was more
important than searching for some Holy Grail to making money</strong>. So I
started reading through all the material on the pros again and noted
what they had to say about&nbsp;losses.</p>
<ul>
<li>My basic advice is don’t lose money. (Jim&nbsp;Rogers)</li>
<li>I’m more concerned about controlling the downside. Learn to take the
    losses. The most important thing in making money is not letting your
    losses get out of hand. (Marty&nbsp;Schwartz)</li>
<li>I’m always thinking about losing money as opposed to making money.
    Don’t focus on making money; focus on protecting what you have.
    (Paul Tudor&nbsp;Jones)</li>
<li>One investor’s two rules of investing: Never lose money. Never
    forget rule #1. (Warren&nbsp;Buffett)</li>
<li>The majority of unskilled investors stubbornly hold onto their
    losses when the losses are small and reasonable. They could get out
    cheaply, but being emotionally involved and human, they keep waiting
    and hoping until their loss gets much bigger and costs them dearly.
    (William&nbsp;O’Neil)</li>
<li>Learn how to take losses quickly and cleanly. Don’t expect to be
    right all the time. If you have a mistake, cut your loss as quickly
    as possible. (Bernard&nbsp;Baruch)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The pros could all make money in contradictory ways because they all
knew how to control their losses.</strong> While one person’s method was making
money, another person with an opposite approach would be losing — if the
second person was in the market. And that’s just it; the second person
wouldn’t be in the market. He’d be on the sidelines with a nominal loss.
The pros consider it their primary responsibility not to lose&nbsp;money.</p>
<p><strong>Learning how not to lose money is more important than learning how to
make&nbsp;money.</strong></p>
