<p>Listening to the Market Huddle from last week (episode #87), I got to hear from George Gammon, 
someone I&#8217;d never heard of.
I&#8217;m not a great fan of hosts of podcasts all interviewing each other.
However, he did make some good points,  one of which was that whereas 
<iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=sFJg&width=670&height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"style="overflow:hidden; width:670px; height:525px;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"></iframe></p>
<h2>Russell&nbsp;2000</h2>
<p>Vincent Deluard points out that the quoted P/E ratio on the Russell 2000 is essentially meaningless,
<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-the-simple-reason-you-cant-believe-the-pe-ratio-for-the-russell-2000-right-now-2020-07-05">here</a>.
It may even be negative, because losses incurred by constituents are simply ignored.
It&#8217;s like me being allowed to ignore all my losing trades in working out my performance to date.
I have known this for a long time, but the index keeps marching up.
I know, I know, nobody wants to invest in firms that make profits in today&#8217;s market, 
so this should have been expected.
Well, if something cannot go on forever it will stop.
But maybe not for a really, really long&nbsp;time.</p>
<h2>Mad&nbsp;Markets</h2>
<p>$<span class="caps">TSLA</span> went up 15% today. It&#8217;s a blatant fraud. The market is truly mad.
However, it&#8217;s not for us to question why, it&#8217;s just for us to buy and buy (puts, if need be).
I have no idea why a company that which will never make a profit or pay a dividend can be worth anything,
but that&#8217;s why Dave Portnoy is rich and I am poor.
Anyway, Fed go Brrrr is making everything go up,
and also vols go up.
Kuppy <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Patrick Cerezna have an interesting discussion on why vols are going up,
but the conclusion they come to is that it&#8217;s the right time to sell vol and go long,
by writing puts on small cap stocks you don&#8217;t mind being exercised into.
Kuppy talked about <span class="caps">PG</span>&amp;E ($<span class="caps">PGEUU</span>), but there are more.
I favour the &#8220;Incredible Hulks&#8221; set, that I originally learned about from Kuppy.
You can have a look at it <a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5e830370d9be6037d4ad6746">here</a>.
What is worth noting is that some of these are trading at a P/E (for the next twelve months, projected) of 2.0. 
Going short in this market is going to lose you money, so buying a stock which is so cheap might be the way to go (<em>this is not trading advice</em>).</p>
<p>If you are really feeling like taking some risk, why not buy some other fraud stocks.
For example, $<span class="caps">NIO</span> went up 23% today. No, it doesn&#8217;t have any P so I can&#8217;t give you a P/E&nbsp;ratio.</p>                </article>
