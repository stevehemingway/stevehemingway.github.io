<h2>Post-Brexit trade with the <span class="caps">EU</span></h2>
<p><img alt="79beecf8da51bafa53af268c07a6420f.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/79beecf8da51bafa53af268c07a6420f.png"></p>
<p>It looks as though trade is flowing more freely. 
<a href="https://huq.io/indicators/northern-regions-stand-to-benefit-as-ports-activity-accelerates-past-jan-2020/">Full&nbsp;details.</a></p>
<h2>Vaccines and&nbsp;globalism</h2>
<p>Politicians have been making things worse by interfering with the normal mechanisms of global trade. 
The end result will almost certainly be more votes for them, but more deaths for the global&nbsp;population.</p>
<h2>Stimulus</h2>
<p>Mario Draghi announced that Italy would spend €221 bn to stimulate the Italian economy.
This is a big number. 
The <span class="caps">UK</span> will probably follow suit, the <span class="caps">IMF</span> is recommending that countries run deficits of 5% of <span class="caps">GDP</span>, the <span class="caps">USA</span> is hitting the ball out of the park, with combined spending of the order of $5T, about 25% of <span class="caps">GDP</span>. The current bill is over 2T, which is intended to fix a few&nbsp;bridges.</p>
<p>Italy will find itself mired in problems, because it is verging on being a failed state. Twenty five percent of taxes are not collected, according to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/37854580-7ae0-42e6-b375-02c422d60882">this article</a>, which of course will just make anyone who is not well enough connected to escape paying his fair share cynical about the whole exercise. Sicily is littered with half-built overpasses, underpasses and road schemes that are simply not connected to the rest of the road network. It is not a coincidence that cement making is a monopoly, run by the mafia (whichever one controls the island). If the money spend just ends up in Swiss bank accounts controlled by criminals, I can&#8217;t see it improving productivity in Italy, which refuses to&nbsp;budge.</p>
<p>Euro enthusiasts, like Martin Wolf, used to argue that once Italy got rid of the lira, it would be forced to confront its chronic productivity shortfall vis-a-vis Germany because there would no longer be the option of just letting the lira drift down against the <span class="caps">DM</span>. How naive! Instead, politicians have simply forced the taxpayers of Germany to endlessly bail out the feckless and corrupt&nbsp;Italians.  </p>
<p>What is interesting, is that nobody (well, no economists) have spoken out against stimulus. Well, Larry Summers, perhaps, but he soon shut up.<br>
Krugman thinks that the Republican party is no so far beyond the pale that even the small minority of Republican-supporting proper economists who would be sceptical about this are keeping their mouths shut, because the party now follows the advice of people who are simply not proper economists, like Kudlow and Peter Navarro.
Somehow, inflation is never coming back. 
Well, we&#8217;re certainly going to test the&nbsp;thesis.</p>
<h2>Markets</h2>
<p><span class="caps">US</span> stocks hit by a Biden comment about doubling Corp Tax.
<span class="caps">EU</span> stocks and Asian ones, pretty flat.
Bonds flattish.
<span class="caps">DXY</span> up a bit, 91.29, continuing its rally.
<span class="caps">BTC</span> continues to fade, $53K,
Metals (copper, gold and silver) down, other commods fairly&nbsp;positive.</p>
<p>Generally, the reflation trade is not getting traction. 
Results are generally strong, but they are all baked&nbsp;in.</p>
<h2>Twitter</h2>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I share the following without comment:<br><br>“President Biden will propose almost doubling the cap gains tax rate for wealthy to&#8230;be as high as 43.4%<br><br>“For New Yorkers, the combined state and federal capital gains rate could be as high as 52.22%.
