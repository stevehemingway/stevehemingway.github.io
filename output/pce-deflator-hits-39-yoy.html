<p>Generally, this was another reflation trade day.
Bonds drifted down a bit, <span class="caps">DXY</span> held steady, the equity markets were up a bit and commodities overall (<span class="caps">GSCI</span>) were flat. 
Oil managed to eke out a 1%&nbsp;rise. </p>
<p><span class="caps">ACWI</span> was up&nbsp;40bp.</p>
<p>Core <span class="caps">PCE</span>  was up 3.4% YoY. 
This is pretty steep, given that all the expensive stuff is kept out of the index.
I guess everyone was expecting this, otherwise the bond market and dollar would not have been so sanguine.
I would not be surprised to see some soft of reaction in the <span class="caps">FX</span> market, except that the <span class="caps">EU</span> and Japan are probably going to show some similar figures.
The stimulus spending, another $1.3T agreed today, in the <span class="caps">US</span> is much heavier in the <span class="caps">US</span>&nbsp;though.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">PCE</span> deflator (the Fed&#8217;s preferred measure) was up 3.9% YoY. This is sanitized relative to <span class="caps">CPI</span>, and must be a big worry for the Fed. 
Of course they are maintaining their &#8220;transitory&#8221; narrative, because they are desperate to avoid tapering (i.e. buying Treasuries at a slightly slower rate than $120B per&nbsp;month).</p>
<p>My view is that five year Treasuries are going to take a hit, fairly soon. <em>Not&nbsp;advice!</em></p>
<h2>BoA sees up to four years of&nbsp;hyperinflation</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/bofa-crashes-transitory-party-sees-4-years-hyperinflation">Here is the link (ZeroHedge: you have been&nbsp;warned).</a></p>
<p><img alt="Not all assets have inflated equally." src="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/asset%20price%20inflation%20Goldman%20June%202021.jpg?itok=OPzckDsM"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the head BofA strategist concludes, it is &#8220;tough to solve inequality with <span class="caps">QE</span>.&#8221; If only anyone at the Fed had this degree of&nbsp;clarity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The nearest equivalent, it is asserted was &#8216;65 to &#8216;68. I was around, but I was not following equity markets at the&nbsp;time. </p>
<p><img alt="Here is the dispersion of returns." src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/60s%20analog.jpg?itok=Swzt-fnY"></p>
<p>Back in the 60&#8217;s it was small caps that were the winners and real estate that barely moved. I doubt if they will repeat the trick, but really it doesn&#8217;t matter much. Equities as a class did pretty well. 
I think the only lesson to be drawn is that in this sort of environment it&#8217;s dangerous to be short of any real or financial asset. Even&nbsp;bonds!</p>
<h2>El Salvador and <span class="caps">BTC</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The government of El Salvador is planning to airdrop ~3,000 <span class="caps">BTC</span> into the hands of its&nbsp;citizens.</p>
<p>And they can’t even print money to buy the&nbsp;Bitcoin.</p>
<p>This will be really crazy to think about 10 years from&nbsp;now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1408272559192252423?s=20</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know enough about this experiment to have a handle on the consequences.
 I don&#8217;t know anything about El Salvador.
 I do know that Maduro of Venezuela was promising an oil-backed cryptocurrency for Venezuela, to replace the worthless predecessor, but as far as I know it never happened and, presumably, the economy became&nbsp;dollarized.</p>
<h2>Ray Dalio and Denis Gartman are saying this is a good time to buy&nbsp;stocks</h2>
<p>The cynic in me tells me that these guys don&#8217;t come on <span class="caps">CNBC</span> to tip their hand.
They tell people to buy when they want to sell.
I might be totally wrong, and these guys might like to share the profits around to the little guy, and pay their taxes. 
But every time I err on the side of giving these guys the benefit of the doubt, I&nbsp;err.</p>
<h2><span class="caps">EXX</span></h2>
<p>Net profit margin: 32%
Return on investment: 16%
Revenue has grown monotonically over last 5 years.
Price/cashflow per share: 5.2
Tot. debt/Tot. capital:&nbsp;23%</p>
<p>Looks too good to be true, eh?
The problem is that this is a coal miner with most of its operations in an increasingly unstable African country, South Africa.
Maybe Ramaphosa will grip the politics and put <span class="caps">SA</span> back on the economic growth track, but the obstacles against this are huge. 
I have never believed that a company with bad economics can be &#8220;turned around&#8221; but a celebrity manager, and I believe the equivalent thing about a&nbsp;country.</p>
<p>I think Exxaro might be worth further investigation. Buying on the local exchange (<span class="caps">JSE</span>) means that you are long coal and short <span class="caps">ZAR</span>, so even if the <span class="caps">SA</span> economy ends up as a basket case, the stock price will look&nbsp;good.</p>
