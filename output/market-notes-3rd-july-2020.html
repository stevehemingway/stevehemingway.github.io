</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h2>Steepeners and&nbsp;flatteners</h2>
<p>Andreas Steno Larsen has written <a href="https://e-markets.nordea.com/#!/article/58681/week-ahead-if-things-are-steep-remember-to-stay-level-headed">his macro piece for Nordea</a>. 
The message seems to be that in the complex dance with the Fed and the <span class="caps">US</span> Treasury (Powell <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Mnuchin) there will be a tightening which will cause the steepener trade to falter, by which Larsen seems to mean the 10year - 2 year yield on USTs. 
To execute the trade you need to know the duration ratio, which is handily available in English and Chines <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/tools-information/quikstrike/treasury-analytics.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/invoice-spread-calculator.html">via the <span class="caps">CME</span> Group website</a>.
As this helpful page points out, the multiplier for the 2-year is twice the 10 year (2000 vs 1000), so the notional ratio is approx 1:1, but don&#8217;t do this at home, folks!
To profit from the flattener, you don&#8217;t sell the long end and buy the short end, because the shape of the curve refers to yields, not prices. Confused? You bet I&nbsp;was!</p>
<p>The drivers yield curves are complex. If you don&#8217;t believe me, read <a href="https://themacrotourist.substack.com/p/the-worlds-biggest-steepener">this post</a> from the wonderful Kevin Muir.
Taking a view on the steepness of the curve sounds a safer bet than going long or short rates, 
but it&#8217;s not <em>that</em>&nbsp;safe! </p>
<h2>More about&nbsp;unemployment</h2>
<p>Unemployment (next to inflation) is almost impossible to measure accurately in normal times.
In the current pandemic, it&#8217;s a hopeless task.
Nevertheless, the market rallied on one measure, which was <a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/02/never-before-have-i-seen-so-much-fake-unemployment-jobs-data-by-the-bureau-of-labor-statistics-while-labor-department-nails-it/">miles away from the other measure</a>.
I don&#8217;t pretend to know what the real figure is, but I&#8217;d be gobsmacked if we ended this calendar year with anything like full employment, either here or in the <span class="caps">US</span>.</p>
<h2>Biden</h2>
<p>I try not to spend too much time looking at <span class="caps">US</span> politics. It&#8217;s far too depressing. <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/505562-biden-must-release-results-of-his-cognitive-decline-tests-voters-need-to">This article</a> though was interesting. It&#8217;s from a reporter who appears vaguely sympathetic to Biden, 
but who reports that around 40% of voters think is suffering from dementia.
How on earth can the Democrats choose a candidate with such a crippling disqualification from being president? 
The <span class="caps">UK</span> Labour Party seems to have a death wish, but at least they chose a leader who is under sixty.
The Dems chose a candidate who is <em>four years older than Bill Clinton</em> (and five years older than Hillary). 
This just shows how dysfunctional the leadership of political parties has become. 
Presumably, Biden ended up as the candidate because he was biddable. 
It&#8217;s a crap deal for the voters, though, and will probably gift Trump another term.
You&#8217;d almost think that the Wall Street donors who pay Hillary $250K for a twenty minute speech and pay so much into the Dems would prefer a business-friendly, anti-redistribution kinda guy after&nbsp;all.</p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p><span class="caps">US</span> markets (equities, anyhow) are closed today, so there is not much to&nbsp;report.</p>
<p>The pubs open tomorrow in the <span class="caps">UK</span>. A symbolic moment, I suppose, 
but I don&#8217;t think it will in any sense represent a cliff edge in terms of our return to normality,
as there will be new outbreaks of the disease, 
and this will cause more ordinary citizens to be fearful.
Maybe I&#8217;m being too pessimistic. 
The last couple of books I&#8217;ve read have been about the Great Depression,
and my mind is constantly brought back to that time, especially in the <span class="caps">USA</span>,
where all the state&#8217;s resources were not enough to put the economy back together again.
I hope I&#8217;m&nbsp;wrong.</p>
