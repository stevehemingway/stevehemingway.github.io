Wolf has written that the Fed is looking to unload all the bonds off its balance sheet before rates start to go up.
This seems rational, for a Fed that wants to avoid taking a huge loss on its $<span class="caps">7TN</span> of bonds.
But it is kind of the elephant in the market: can it really unwind before crashing the market?
Isn&#8217;t it always going to be the marginal&nbsp;seller?</p>
<p>The BoE seems to be about to follow the Fed&#8217;s playbook from last time.
This will guarantee losses, maybe. But the Treasury is on the other side of the trade,
so who really&nbsp;cares?</p>
<h2>Wrap&nbsp;up</h2>
<p>I didn&#8217;t really pay attention later in the afternoon today. 
Basically, the market went nowhere.
Probably the &#8220;Giant Five&#8221; gave the overall market some&nbsp;lift.</p>
<p>Gold seems to be attracting some interest, even if it isn&#8217;t really making much headway.
Bonds are struggling to break&nbsp;higher.</p>
<p>Workhorse Group ($<span class="caps">WKHS</span>), which makes battery electric vans, seems to be riding on $<span class="caps">TSLA</span>&#8217;s rise. 
Somewhat reminiscent of Nikola Corp.
Everyone wants some of Elon&#8217;s magic powers of stockmarket&nbsp;levitation.</p>
<p>Suddenly everyone is wise about Wirecard ($<span class="caps">WDI</span>), even though the <span class="caps">MSM</span> (with a few honourable exceptions, such as the <span class="caps">FT</span>) had completely ignored the warning signals for a long time.
No sign of any spillover effect in the direction of $<span class="caps">TSLA</span>.</p>
<p>Ten year yields seem to have reached a floor. Maybe worth writing some calls on&nbsp;futures.</p>
