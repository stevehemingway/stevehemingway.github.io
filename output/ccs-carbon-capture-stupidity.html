<p><a href="https://twitter.com/TESLAcharts/status/1352430248273522693">There is a good thread from <span class="caps">TC</span></a> which analyses the issues with <span class="caps">CCS</span>. 
Essentially they boil down to the&nbsp;economics:</p>
<ul>
<li>there is no real economic use for <span class="caps">CO</span>~2~ in the quantities it would need to be&nbsp;produced,</li>
<li>the only economic use would be in increasing the yield from oil wells, but that&#8217;s not gonna get&nbsp;subsidies,</li>
<li>it requires huge capital investment to build the infrastructure, which destroys&nbsp;value,</li>
<li>it would need a lot of pipelines. People, and politicians, don&#8217;t like&nbsp;pipelines,</li>
<li>universities may have shown prototype projects can work, but this is a million miles from doing something in the real&nbsp;world.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this is correct, but I feel that <span class="caps">TC</span> underestimates the theatrical aspect of politics. The fact that something is woefully uneconomic (in the sense that it destroys value for the whole population) has never been a great barrier to stopping politicians doing something. Look at the endless money thrown at the military industrial complex, and the never-ending wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The military industrial complex now has some strong competition from the green energy complex, and politicians know which of the two has the stronger buy-in from the voting&nbsp;public.</p>
<h1>Hedge funds are &#8216;all&nbsp;in&#8217;</h1>
<p><img alt="02e192a7d9fef3ed79528abe1da0a692.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/02e192a7d9fef3ed79528abe1da0a692.png"></p>
<h1>Inflation may get&nbsp;going</h1>
<p><a href="https://thesoundingline.com/el-erian-if-more-stimulus-materializes-fed-will-have-hard-time-with-inflation-expectations/">El Erian warns again</a>.</p>
<p>He said something similar, but at greater length <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bdff6e40-d150-4699-b3bf-4d56ced19090">in the <span class="caps">FT</span></a>, but focussed on the potential political difficulties of building growth and productivity (which, of course, go together, especially in a static working age&nbsp;population).</p>
<h1><span class="caps">EM</span> vs <span class="caps">DM</span></h1>
<p>It seems to me that emerging markets are simply in a better shape than developed markets.
They don&#8217;t have the burden of a huge public sector (60% in the <span class="caps">UK</span> now) which will, eventually, translate into a huge tax burden. 
They have relatively little regulation, and are much less likely to intervene in private sector contracts (e.g. for labour or housing services). 
Obviously, <span class="caps">EM</span> has problems with corruption, which funnels resources to activities which do not benefit the majority, but this sort of sub-optimal allocation of governmental resources is not unknown in&nbsp;DMs. </p>
<p>All economies are moving towards being service based, but there is still a lot of manufacturing. 
Even in the <span class="caps">UK</span>, it amounts to 20%!  EMs are more commodity production based, and with commodities still at decade old lows, this will help, because whatever happens in the West, we&#8217;ll need to eat, consume made items and use commodities for almost&nbsp;everything.</p>
<p>Certainly, the most egregiously highly valued of all DMs is the <span class="caps">NASDAQ</span>. Europe and the <span class="caps">UK</span> are probably not too&nbsp;bad.</p>
<p>These are not original thoughts, but they certainly chime with my&nbsp;outlook. </p>
