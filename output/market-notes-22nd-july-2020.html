<p>Risk off today: gold up, bonds up, equities down, <span class="caps">VIX</span> up. Dollar ($<span class="caps">DX</span>) up, especially against emerging market&nbsp;currencies.</p>
<h2>Bailout money goes to shareholders and creditors of already insolvent&nbsp;company</h2>
<p>Well, who would have guessed that might happen?
<a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/21/congressional-watchdog-rips-bailout-of-trucking-company-yrc-which-had-close-calls-with-bankruptcy-in-years-before-covid-19/">Here are the gory details</a>.</p>
<h2>What I read&nbsp;today</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://themarket.ch/interview/russell-napier-central-banks-have-become-irrelevant-ld.2323?mc_cid=6c3d214ce8&amp;mc_eid=8d66df2c11">this interview</a> Russell Napier, of the <em>Solid Ground Investment Report</em> states the usual arguments that increased real money supply (created by commercial banks) will result in inflation.
His pick is Swissies (<span class="caps">CHF</span>), on the basis that Switzerland has well-capitalized banks, and not much of a fiscal or current account deficit. 
The problem is with this that it&#8217;s not clear what trade will take advantage of this: if all countries are debasing their currency, what should I buy?
Seems eminently&nbsp;reasonable!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly more sensible than shorting equities, <a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2020/07/16/did-the-market-actually-recover-from-covid-19/">as Kuppy explains</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4db326d9-4749-4e13-9ee1-939b0ca7d67d">This article</a> suggests that copper, and copper miners, are under-priced relative to gold miners. Antofagasta is considered a buy. Reasonably interesting thesis, although it does depend on China&#8217;s reopening and reconstruction boom&nbsp;continuing.</p>
<p><a href="https://e-markets.nordea.com/#!/article/58693/fx-weekly-kanye-vs-trump-vs-biden">This longish piece from Nordea</a> argues that Biden will be bullish for the dollar, and bearish for risk assets, and this might start soon.
He also points out (as did Druckenmiller a month or so ago) that the <span class="caps">US</span> Treasury is about to drain a massive amount of liquidity  from banks through <span class="caps">UST</span> issuance. The article quantifies this: $1.65 trillion <span class="caps">UST</span> issuance, with $0.483 trillion in June alone. A trillion here, a trillion there and pretty soon you&#8217;re talking real money, as Reagan almost said.
Nordea argues that this has to flatten the yield curve. 
I haven&#8217;t had a chance to read the article in detail, but I think that  Andreas Steno Larsen and Joachim Bernhardsen make some well-argued and compelling arguments. 
How risk assets have held up so well is a mystery to me.
The bulls always say, if they are asked how they think that the <span class="caps">FAANG</span> can keep going up, they tend to say &#8220;The Fed, Bro.&#8221; But the Treasury is in some ways a bigger beast when it comes to impacting the money supply, and it&#8217;s draining it like Trump promised to drain the <span class="caps">DC</span> swamp. Unlike Trump, it&#8217;s actually happening, and will continue to happen as more of the real economy stalls, <span class="caps">IMHO</span>.</p>
