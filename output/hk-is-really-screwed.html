<p>Stanley Druckenmiller is a legendary trader, with a record which is a lot better than Warren Buffett&#8217;s, in terms of annual consistency.
He looks at economics, industry characteristics, accounts, market liquidity and charts. 
Interestingly, he doesn&#8217;t believe that technical analysis is voodoo. 
He particularly believes in taking concentrated bets, but with a willingness to flip positions very&nbsp;rapidly.</p>
<p>The classic momentum strategy of letting winners run and realizing early losses is the strategy of Jerry Parker.
He was interviewed on this week&#8217;s Market Huddle. His approach is to have a lot of (dilute?) positions, in many markets, and 
apply the mechanical rules of trend following &#8220;and nothing else&#8221; religiously. 
This has done well for him. Druckenmiller&#8217;s technique has done well for him. Either they could have both got lucky, or there could be more than
one route to success when managing&nbsp;investments.</p>

<h2>China</h2>
<p><span class="caps">HK</span> is screwed. Many companies cannot produced auditable accounts. Shanghai is in lockdown. <span class="caps">US</span> bonds yield more than <span class="caps">RMB</span> ones.
Evergrande and co. are on the point of bankruptcy.
The government will have to spend an absolute fortune to stop the economy cratering.
I cannot see the <span class="caps">RMB</span> going up in this environment.
I get it that the <span class="caps">RMB</span> has been held down by the authorities for a long time to maximize exports, but now China has a fairly balanced current account (or did).
