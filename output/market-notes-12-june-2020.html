In situations like this, probably the best thing to do is to wait for the dust to clear,
although a bit of hedging goes a long&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>At 6pm <span class="caps">BST</span> a lot of the bounce had gone out of the equities market although most sectors were still up.
Healthcare and pharma were not so bouncy, presumably because they&#8217;ve previously bounced so far.
Commodities were mostly up, except gold, which follows from this being a risk-off day.
<span class="caps">WTI</span> crude was basically flat. It is at 36, having jumped from 12.4 on 28 April. A long way&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>The dollar is up a bit. <span class="caps">EM</span> currencies seem relatively&nbsp;strong.</p>
<p>Credit (<span class="caps">JNK</span>) is up and sovereign (<span class="caps">ZN</span>) is down, all consistent with this being a modestly risk-on&nbsp;day.</p>
<p><span class="caps">TSLA</span>, having briefly exceeded the market cap of Toyota, is sinking again. 
The stock is pumped relentlessly by Musk, but there are many stories that he can&#8217;t keep this up 
much longer, as more and more of his key staff jump&nbsp;ship.</p>
<h2>Things I was reading and listening&nbsp;to:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I listed to the 13 March edition of <a href="https://markethuddle.com/">The Market Huddle</a>. To his great credit, 
Kevin Muir correctly called the bounce of equity markets off the lows, 
and identified the cause: extravagant money creation by the Fed.&nbsp;Respect! </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/06/11/a-word-about-the-chaos-in-the-unemployment-data-week-12-of-the-u-s-labor-market-collapse/">Some ugly news on unemployment in the <span class="caps">USA</span></a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, 
I&#8217;m outta here. Have a good&nbsp;weekend!</p>
