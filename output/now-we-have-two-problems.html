<p>Well, we have some incredible numbers for unemployment. Any regression model trying to fit this charg is going to explode. We have to fall back on our intuition. I can&#8217;t see this is going to fully reverse for a long time. Larry Summers said as much in today&#8217;s <span class="caps">FT</span>.  But the CBs are doing their bit, and the &#8220;don&#8217;t fight the Fed&#8221; trade is in the&nbsp;ascendant.</p>

<p>But still, the disconnect between the stockmarket and the consumer is incredible (Morning&nbsp;Consult)[https://morningconsult.com/2020/05/12/analysis-consumer-confidence-wall-street-main-street-fall/].</p>

<p>From Bill&nbsp;Fleckenstein:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Anyone Who Isn&#8217;t Confused Really Doesn&#8217;t Understand the Situation&#8221;
So for those itching to buy puts or short stocks, you really have to wait until there is some sign of a rollover in the market and some weakness that allows you to convince yourself that the rally has ended and that, in hindsight, it will be seen as a failing rally. (As a practical matter, someone &#8212; in this case, me &#8212; making the case that today&#8217;s action was the end of the rally could short a few targets with nearby stops to see if the idea wants to&nbsp;work.)</p>
<p>That may be restating the obvious, given all that I have said about this in the past, but I can tell in discussions with people that there are many who just can&#8217;t fathom how we could be seeing what we&#8217;re seeing, but that is the power of the printing press, as nebulous a concept as that may seem to&nbsp;some.</p>
