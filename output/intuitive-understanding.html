<h2>Tacit&nbsp;knowledge</h2>
<p>When I was quite young, I must have seen some sort of <span class="caps">TV</span> interview of Hermann Bondi, then the master of a Cambridge college.
He said something which resonated with me, which is that in some sense we have an instinctive grasp of Newtonian mechanics.
A dog can catch a ball thrown to it, even though it has never seen the equation of a parabola. 
Maybe this is what is meant.
Anyway, it&#8217;s an old trope of economics that ordinary people have no intuitive grasp of it.
Politicians from Alec Douglas-Home to Margaret Thatcher have been mocked for saying things that betrayed a misunderstanding of modern (probably implicitly Keynsian) ideas of how the economy as a whole&nbsp;works.</p>
<p>Personally, I am not really persuaded that our instincts lead us astray so badly in macroeconomics. 
I think that we do understand that our consumption is someone else&#8217;s income. 
Keynes wrote about &#8220;the paradox of thrift&#8221; which is just another version of the fallacy of composition: if we all stop spending, in order to save more, it won&#8217;t work because our lack of spending will result in everyone not having an income.
This strictly works in a closed economy, obviously, because if we could get foreigners to take all our output, we&#8217;d be fine (except that we&#8217;d end up having our savings in foreign&nbsp;assets).</p>
<p>Bondi actually wrote a book, &#8220;Relativity and Common Sense: A New Approach to Einstein,&#8221; which attempted to make Special Relativity intuitively plausible. 
It&#8217;s interesting that he, as a mathematical prodigy, chose to do this without&nbsp;equations.</p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>Continued deflation trade running.
Driven by the rise of the Delta Variant, possibly.
Oil depressed, possibly by new report saying that global warming is more a thing than&nbsp;ever.</p>
