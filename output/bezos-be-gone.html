<h1>Trading&nbsp;Ideas</h1>
<p>All real assets have benefited tremendously from the massive injections of liquidity carried out by central banks generally, but the Fed in particular. Stan Druckenmiller has made some comments about where he sees value going forward(See <a href="https://twitter.com/DivergentVentur/status/1357459321609723915">this tread by @DivergentVentur</a> for the detail).<br>
<span class="caps">TL</span>;<span class="caps">DR</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>M2 explosion will trigger&nbsp;inflation,</li>
<li>the Fed will start yield curve control, so there is no point in going short long-dated&nbsp;Treasuries,</li>
<li>the monetary expansion will eventually bleed through into <span class="caps">USD</span> (not yet&nbsp;tho!),</li>
<li>commodities (maybe via miners/producers) is a way to&nbsp;profit,</li>
<li><span class="caps">FAANG</span> could do well, because a lot of other stocks are&nbsp;terrible,</li>
<li>Asia, especially Asian tech and currencies will be a good place to shelter from the fallout of the exploding&nbsp;deficit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Energy is likely to benefit. Coal (especially) and oil (quite a lot) have been beaten down a lot by the assumption that everyone in China and India will be driving around in a Tesla in a year or so&#8217;s time. I can&#8217;t quite believe it myself, and &#8212; in any case &#8212; those batteries ain&#8217;t gonna charge themselves, and will largely depend on smokey old power stations to generate the electricity they&nbsp;need.</p>
<h1>Chart of the&nbsp;day</h1>
<p>The value plotted is the instantaneous expectation of average inflation over a five year period, that period starting in five years time. It&#8217;s derived fromt he prices of regular treasuy notes and bonds, and <span class="caps">TIPS</span> &#8212; inflation protected securities. It shows that the market expects that the rate will be above 2% for a sustained period, and that expectation is not reversing (over a smoothed&nbsp;timescale).</p>

<h1>Wrap</h1>
<p>Risk on,&nbsp;again: </p>
<ul>
<li>All major equity markets up, except <span class="caps">UK</span> and Germany. Russell 2000 hits and all-time&nbsp;high,</li>
<li>Govt. bond yields up almost everywhere (exception: Italy and France, due to credit effects); general&nbsp;steepening,</li>
<li>All crypto&nbsp;up,</li>
<li><span class="caps">DXY</span> down, 0.6%, reaction to yesterday&#8217;s strength,&nbsp;presumably.</li>
</ul>
<p>News was not&nbsp;heavy:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="caps">US</span> consumer credit a bit weak (nowhere open to spend on your credit&nbsp;card),</li>
<li>Bank of England ruled out negative rates and lowered its forecast for the rest of the&nbsp;year,</li>
<li><span class="caps">EM</span> currencies strong (<span class="caps">MXP</span> <span class="amp">&amp;</span> <span class="caps">BRL</span>).</li>
</ul>
<h1>Reflections</h1>
<p>A universal characteristic of humanity since the invention of agriculture has been organized religion.
Many, if not all, political movements have a strong religious affiliation, and almost no mainstream politician ever dare say anything negative about religion. 
Observance, if not unconditional faith, has been the norm in &#8216;civilized&#8217; societies. 
Communities and &#8216;faith-based&#8217; communities used to be the same thing.
Societies with shared culture and norms function better than those with atomized ones.
Along with the collapse in religious observance has been a failure of the nuclear family as the bedrock of society.
I sound like the a boomer I am, but these changes in the way we live have occurred without debate, political or otherwise.
Institutions like the Roman Catholic church, which have weathered the storms of millennia have suddenly experience a hemorrhage of members, without anyone having a convincing&nbsp;explanation.</p>
<p>A quick google throws up some explanations (e.g. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/09/atheism-fastest-growing-religion-us/598843/">this one</a>) but I am not&nbsp;convinced. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The obvious question for anybody who spends at least two seconds looking at the graph above is: <em>What the hell happened around&nbsp;1990?</em></p>
<p>According to Christian Smith, a sociology and religion professor at the University of Notre Dame, America’s nonreligious lurch has mostly been the result of three historical events: the association of the Republican Party with the Christian right, the end of the Cold War, and&nbsp;9/11.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These simply do not explain the <span class="caps">UK</span>&nbsp;experience. </p>
