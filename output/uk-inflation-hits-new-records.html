<h2>What does Larry want companies to&nbsp;do?</h2>
<p>I am a huge fan of Matt Levine.
His analysis is top class.
He is great at questioning everyone and everything.
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-18/blackrock-still-likes-capitalism">Today</a> he looks
at what the point of Larry Fink&#8217;s letter to CEOs is.
In some sense, it&#8217;s a defence of the Friedmanite position that a <span class="caps">CEO</span> should focus on maximizing returns to shareholders, 
and let those shareholders decide on what non-financial objectives they wish to pursue.
It&#8217;s impossible to summarize: I recommend that you just read it.
His newsletter is free, except for the opportunity cost of having to read it every&nbsp;day.</p>
<h2>Dash for (losing)&nbsp;cash</h2>
<p>I have never used a food delivery app. (Boomer here!) 
I have ordered plenty of takeaways in my time, of which I&#8217;ve collected on 99.5% of occasions.
The odd time I&#8217;ve had food delivered, it has taken ages, and it has been cold and unappetizing by the time it reached me.
Nowadays I&#8217;m good enough at basic cooking that I can rustle up something edible in less time than it would take me to order and collect a&nbsp;takeaway.</p>
<p>So, all the apps make no sense to me. But they are highly priced by the market, since they have shown frenzied growth over the lockdown,
and sales and sales growth are the only metrics that matter to today&#8217;s investors.
But the tide is turning, and investors are becoming sceptical.
<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4480216-doordash-pandemic-peak-will-come-down-to-earth">This hatchet job on Door Dash is worth a look</a>.
The author points out the quite severe headwinds facing $<span class="caps">DASH</span>, and the venal behaviour of its <span class="caps">CEO</span>.
It&#8217;s on my long-list, but it looks as though the shareprice plunge that is taking place now might spell the end.
Of course, Apple might come up with a bid for it at a premium of four times the market price, so be careful out there!
Seriously, the sector looks ripe for consolidation, which will create dangerous obstacles for any short&nbsp;sellers.</p>
<h2><span class="caps">UK</span>&nbsp;Inflation</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s looking&nbsp;bad.</p>

<h2>Wheee &#8212; stocks about to come down to&nbsp;earth?</h2>
<p><img alt="Maybe" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FI_bHQqVcAsL0g0?format=png&amp;name=medium"></p>
<p>I&#8217;m thinking $<span class="caps">NIO</span>&nbsp;especially.</p>
<h2>Can I change this and get a dynamic&nbsp;update?</h2>
<h2>What you should have&nbsp;bought</h2>
<p><img alt="this" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/high-growth.png"></p>
<h2>Understanding Bidens attack on the meat-packing&nbsp;industry</h2>
<p><a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/political-hamburglars">Doomberg is dope</a>.
This is a wonderful article about how the sausage factory works. 
You should read it, because you might learn how to make a fortune trading cattle futures.
But the main thrust of the article is how laws get passed as a <em>quid pro quo</em> for political donations.
I was going to say &#8220;as a result of lobbying,&#8221; but it&#8217;s nothing to do with lobbying: it&#8217;s naked corruption.
As Doomberg points out, both the big parties in the <span class="caps">US</span> are equally implicated, so there is no where for the voter who 
doesn&#8217;t want laws dictated by corporate donors to&nbsp;turn.</p>
<h2>$<span class="caps">TSMC</span> is an amazing&nbsp;company</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.fabricatedknowledge.com/p/tsmc-earnings-the-handoff-from-mobile?r=nmbt&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=email">Nicole Hemsoth explains why Taiwan Semi is such a dominant force in the industry.</a>
<span class="caps">OK</span>, it&#8217;s expensive: 150 trailing P/E, 130 forward. This doesn&#8217;t leave much room for error but, damn, it must have a deeper moat than $<span class="caps">AAPL</span> or $<span class="caps">AMZN</span>. 
I don&#8217;t know about this. At least the operation makes a profit, unlike so many high-tech stocks.
Maybe the problem is that it&#8217;s so big, growth will weaken going&nbsp;forward.</p>
<h2>Autonomous&nbsp;Trucks</h2>
<p><a href="https://thebearcave.substack.com/p/problems-at-embark-technology-embk?r=nmbt&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">Embark looks a clear short.</a>. Not advice, just my take on The Bear Cave&#8217;s article on the subject. 
It&#8217;s a software house developing autonomous driving code, with no patents, no sales, no credibility, which went public via a <span class="caps">SPAC</span>.
What&#8217;s not to&nbsp;like?</p>
<h2>Lyn Alden Jan&nbsp;Newsletter</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.lynalden.com/january-2022-newsletter/">Read it here.</a>
Always worth a look, it seems that Lyn has moved from the stance that &#8220;<span class="caps">US</span> equities are too expensive, but you gotta keep buying them anyway&#8221; to the stance that &#8220;Maybe inflation, tightening, commodity supply shocks and all the rest will finally make a difference.&#8221;
Several good charts to show <span class="caps">US</span> exceptionalism, in terms of how much global savings ends up there. Basically 61% of global asset markets, but only 23% of global economy: a big&nbsp;disconnect.</p>
<h2>Demographic&nbsp;challenges</h2>
<p>We are getting old, as a society. The direction of travel of productivity is terrible. Growth is negative, and this weighs on the ability of societies to distribute consumption to the working classes.
The response of governments is to create money. Since 1971, there is no external anchor for currencies. 
The experiment has allowed governments to run incredible deficits and through them maintain social programs without 
offending the 0.01% that hold so much of society&#8217;s wealth.
This worked remarkably well over the pandemic, but now many central banks are raising rates.
Real rates are still going down, but this will lead to inflation, which on its own will do the hard work of redistributing wealth downwards, which is politically&nbsp;intolerable.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what will happen, but I cannot see this ending well, and I also cannot see realized and implied volatilities on 
all assets, but particularly forex rates staying as low as they are right&nbsp;now.</p>
<h2>Oscar&nbsp;Health</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/the-oscar-puzzle?r=nmbt&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=email">Oscar Health: health insurance&nbsp;disruptor.</a></p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>The Nasdaq looks ugly. 
<img alt="from Trading Economics" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/ndx_ind.svg">
Twitter is getting twitchy: $<span class="caps">AAPL</span> has closed beneath its 50-day <span class="caps">MA</span> for the first time in living memory.
Forex and bonds were quiet, although the 10Y is now up at 1.88%.
Commodities all seem to be higher. 
The market has decided that &#8216;transitory&#8217; is definitely &#8216;taboo&#8217;.
Bitcoin looks&nbsp;sick:</p>
