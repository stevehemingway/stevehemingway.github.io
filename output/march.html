<h2>Swangley&#8217;s Farm Solar <span class="caps">PV</span></h2>
<p>The proposed solar farm at Swangley&#8217;s Farm has been &#8216;called in&#8217;. It will
be referred to the Secretary of State for the Dept. for Communities and
Local Government under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, Section
70. This was the recommendation of the planning officer of the District
Council. Documents relating to the application will now have to be
examined by the Planning Inspectorate. As of the time of writing, it is
not clear how long this process will&nbsp;take.</p>
<h2><span class="caps">NHDC</span> Council&nbsp;Tax</h2>
<p>At the District Council of the 12th February it was decided to increase
its proportion of Council tax by 1.9%, or &pound;3.88 for a Band D property in
Knebworth. For such a property the contribution to the District Council
becomes &pound;208.01. The balance of what you pay on your Council Tax is made
up of contributions to the Parish, the Police and the County, in order
of increasing cost, for the important services they provide to us&nbsp;all.</p>
<h2>Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan&nbsp;Consultation</h2>
<p>Welwyn Hatfield has started consulting on its Local Plan. Responses must
be submitted by the 20th March, so there is still time for you to
comment. For residents of Knebworth the proposal that is likely to be of
most interest is the potential development of the field between Gun
Meadow Avenue and Monread Lodge, although there are a number of
proposals along the B197 which will have an impact on Knebworth.
There is a Local Plan drop-in Consultation Event for the Welhat Plan on
7th March at Hatfield Hub, 56, Town Centre, Hatfield, <span class="caps">AL10</span> <span class="caps">0JJ</span>. For
further information contact the Welwyn Hatfield Planning Policy Team on
01707 357 000 or at&nbsp;planningpolicy@welhat.gov.uk.</p>
