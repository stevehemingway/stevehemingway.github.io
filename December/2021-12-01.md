title: It's a RIOT

# Wednesday,  1, December 2021

## It's a $RIOT -- Riot Blockchain

I am unconvinced about bitcoin.
It's a great idea, but as a currency, it just doesn't have the liquidity, convenience or cost advantage of existing money-like assets (like USTs or banknotes).
Anyway, I'm in a minority, and people want to invest in $BTC, which is fine.
Institutions are being pushed by their customers into doing so, and for this reason Greyscale Bitcoin Trust ($GBTC) has had a fantastic run.

If you like gold, you probably like gold miners even more. By analogy if you like BTC you'll like $RIOT even more.

Bitcoin to me seems a bit like Amazon. A lot of people considered the company doomed in the late 90's, because it would never make money. Guess what: they were actually 100% right. $AMZN does not make any profits from its retail operation, although its cloud computing division does mint money. 

Maybe we're here now with BTC. It will never work as a currency, but someone will discover something it does do well, and with companies like $RIOT getting free capital to run the infrastructure, it'll eventually be in great demand.

Seriously, I would have dismissed this argument out of hand ten years ago, but now I'm not so sure.

## Comparisons with March 2020

Oil has been hammered recently. Robin Brooks points out that things can go horribly wrong when oil prices fall dramatically.

It all started with oil prices <a href="https://t.co/e2pmcLB3zV">pic.twitter.com/e2pmcLB3zV</a></p>&mdash; Robin Brooks (@RobinBrooksIIF) <a href="https://twitter.com/RobinBrooksIIF/status/1464594888301895680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Oil prices seem to have pulled back today, and maybe OPEC+ will quicker to react, but omicron has triggered a fairly violent reaction in commodities.
[There is definitely evidence that OPEC is reacting to omicron](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ftse-stock-markets-oil-price-dax-cac-sp-500-omicron-084455028.html).
Most populations have a sort of resigned compliance with new lockdown edicts, but I wonder how many Christmases need to be cancelled before voters say "enough is enough."

Covid is becoming endemic now. 
It seems unlikely we'll ever distribute enough vaccines to developing countries to eliminate it.
It will probably out-evolve our ability to make it extinct, but omicron seems to obey the general pattern of parasites evolving so that they are less likely to kill their host.

## China

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">FT. Being rich in China is no funny business:<br><br>&quot;Among the 72 billionaires, 15 were murdered, 17 committed suicide, seven died from accidents, 14 were executed according to the law and 19 died from diseases.&quot;</p>&mdash; Daniel Lacalle (@dlacalle_IA) <a href="https://twitter.com/dlacalle_IA/status/1465946235509084160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Deng changed China, in a way that would have been unimaginable to Mao. 
He unleashed the forces of capitalism, but China remains very unlike any western capitalist country.

It is a country that is brutal in its treatment of any dissent within its claimed borders. 
US plutocrats try to pretend that it's warm and cuddly, but it's simply not. 
[The idea that it's just behaving like a strict parent](https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1465660719756681218?s=20) is laughable. 
Dalio's nervousness indicates that he doesn't believe what he's saying either, but cannot afford to tell the truth.

## Tesla -- $TSLA:NDQ

I hate writing about this insane stock. 
Today I'll link to something about SpaceX: private, but supposedly evidence of Elon's commercial genius. 
Well [it seems like SpaceX is not making money either](https://twitter.com/TMFAssociates/status/1464595216279605256?s=20).

## Shipping

Worth following.

## Triton -- $TRTN:NDQ

Unlike most shipping stocks, Triton International has not made much headway this year.
It seems to be growing its EPS at a steady clip, and always beating estimates.
Its margins are slim, but it has strong and steady revenues.
At P/E of ~9 and a div. yield of 4.5%, and a dividend coming up, it's worth a look.

## Wrap

More tightening/tapering talk from JPoww and the first US omicron variant case identified pushed down the markets.
The 10Y Treasury is down to 1.4189% in yield, but this is still above where it was through most of September.
$DXY barely moved.
Oil is down because "the market" doesn't believe that OPEC will reduce supply. We will see.
