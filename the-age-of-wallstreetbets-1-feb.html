<p>This chart shows that banks will be even keener to dump their Treasuries on the Fed. 
I guess that&#8217;s what Yellen&nbsp;wants.</p>
<p><img alt="c126b3418a1784d884da15149707c66c.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/c126b3418a1784d884da15149707c66c.png">
It seems incredible that a few punks on Reddit can spook the whole of the hedge fund short selling crowd.
<span class="caps">TBF</span>, after Tesla, there can&#8217;t be many of them left.
What is interesting, now, is who will buy when prices fade: there are no shorts left to&nbsp;cover.</p>
<p>The guys at The Market Ear are&nbsp;worried:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s been an interesting period since Biden entered the house. Latest developments in equity markets have been extreme. There are many views on what is going on, who did what, who is to blame etc, but we leave this to you to&nbsp;decide.</p>
<p>The run up to this latest mini correction has seen &#8220;impressive&#8221; price action in many assets and forcing most to join the momentum trades, from chasing bitcoin, Tesla, small caps and now lately the Reddit&nbsp;shorts.</p>
<p>This has created an interesting aggregate psychology of the crowd, all based on the same principles of greed and fear. Lot of newbies have joined the trading space. As <span class="caps">GS</span> pointed out earlier this week there are more than 50 million &#8220;traders&#8221; across the various trading Apps these days, and that figure has probably spiked after this&nbsp;week.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">FOMO</span> aspects of trading has never been stronger. The new normal is having 40%,50%,60%, +100% returns. Risk is something people have not even spoken about, until this week. Frequent readers of <span class="caps">TME</span> know our strong focus on managing your p/l via a rigorous risk management&nbsp;methodology.</p>
<p>Most people lack these skills, and at best follow some VaR model they hardly understand (at the institutional level). Rest of the crowd, majority of the new trading retail elite, at best have a stop loss strategy, but that&#8217;s&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Anyway, the first chart is showing the imploded shorts in <span class="caps">SPX</span>. Thinking about the downside has been out of fashion. Long in pretty much anything has been well rewarded. This has led to people abandoning index shorts as hedging has lately been seen as &#8220;only costing money&#8221;. Bottom line is shorts are at extremely low&nbsp;levels.</p>
<p>What about fear (<span class="caps">VIX</span>)?</p>
<p>While people have puked shorts, the &#8220;structural bid in volatility&#8221; has continued to trade with a strong bid during the entire autumn. Recall our various posts regarding the strong bid in <span class="caps">VVIX</span>. <span class="caps">VIX</span> of <span class="caps">VIX</span> has traded extremely strong for months and has been indicating <span class="caps">VIX</span> at low 20&#8217;s (despite low realized vols back then) was simply too low given the trajectory of <span class="caps">VVIX</span>. Things obviously changed this&nbsp;week.</p>
<p>The problem for most &#8220;pundits&#8221; is they saw <span class="caps">VIX</span> as too high in the low 20&#8217;s and investment banks have all been in &#8220;sell <span class="caps">VIX</span> and vol&#8221; mode. After the Georgia run off, all we have seen is sell volatility notes from&nbsp;banks.</p>
<p>So this time around people dismissed hedging for several&nbsp;reasons.</p>
<p>People are long, have poured record amount of money into equity longs recently, puked shorts, dismissed having vol hedges/downside protection and then &#8220;suddenly&#8221; the most ironic catalyst, a giant short squeeze in &#8220;hot&#8221; names, creates a massive de-leveraging and hits VaR&nbsp;hard.</p>
<p>Second chart shows the huge move in <span class="caps">VIX</span> and <span class="caps">VVIX</span>. <span class="caps">VIX</span> is trying to catch up to the <span class="caps">VVIX</span> gap we have been pointing out for weeks, but <span class="caps">VVIX</span> remains well&nbsp;bid.</p>
<p>Third chart shows <span class="caps">SPX</span> and the 2/8 month <span class="caps">VIX</span> futs spread. The recent panic bid in short term maturities has seen the spread explode to the upside. The crowd has gone from hating protection, to &#8220;must buy&#8221; it at any price. The most &#8220;bang for the buck&#8221; in term of gamma risk is in the short term maturities, so despite these costing less in terms of premium, people bid up the short end of the curve just to get as much protection as they can for the &#8220;sudden&#8221; moves (this is (still) not a vega&nbsp;squeeze).</p>
<p>The stress this time is huge. All things equal the 2/8 <span class="caps">VIX</span> spread should be less sensitive as the corona stress should have been ebbing out by now, but note that the move in the spread now is similar to the first part of the sell off during the corona crisis. Back then <span class="caps">SPX</span> was down approx 12% when the <span class="caps">VIX</span> 2/8 months spread reached similar levels to where we are trading now. So far <span class="caps">SPX</span> is down some 3.5% from all time highs. No, it does not mean we must crash another 9% from here just because the <span class="caps">VIX</span> 2/8 spread is trading the way it is, but it shows the extreme stress this market is pricing, despite the moves actually rather small so&nbsp;far.</p>
<p>The weekend has provided some extra time for risk managers and head traders/CIOs to stress test books and scenarios. Expect next week to be as &#8220;dynamic&#8221; as this week turned out to&nbsp;be.</p>

<h1>Best quote relating to the Reddit&nbsp;Rampage</h1>
<p>Alex Manzara is wonderful. He quoted&nbsp;this: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fear? That’s the other guy’s problem.  Nothing you have ever experienced will prepare you for the absolute carnage you ae about to witness.  Super Bowl, World Series – they don’t know what pressure is.  In this building, it’s either kill or be killed.  You make no friends in the pits and you take no prisoners.  One minute you’re up half a million in soybeans and next, boom, your kids don’t go to college and they’ve repossessed your Bentley.  Are you with&nbsp;me?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the context, click <a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/fear-thats-the-other-guys-problem/">here</a>. The Tuesday post, which is referenced in this post, is <a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/gamers/">here</a>. When insiders like Alex are disgusted by what is going on in the Fed, the whole system has got to be rotten. This is not one of the Redditors sounding&nbsp;off.</p>
<h1>Wrap</h1>
<p>Today was definitely risk&nbsp;on/deflationary:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="caps">ES</span> futures up&nbsp;1.75%,</li>
<li>nearly all commodities up: uranium &gt;10%, $<span class="caps">PAAS</span> <span class="caps">UP</span> 12% (the <span class="caps">WSB</span> crowd talking about ramping&nbsp;silver), </li>
<li>$<span class="caps">GLD</span> up 1% (probably dragged up by&nbsp;silver),</li>
<li><span class="caps">TIP</span> down&nbsp;0.2%,</li>
<li>$<span class="caps">TLT</span> up&nbsp;4bp,</li>
<li>Nat Gas. up&nbsp;10%,</li>
</ul>
<p><em>but</em></p>
<ul>
<li>bitcoin down&nbsp;2.4%,</li>
<li><span class="caps">DX</span> down&nbsp;0.5%.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Thought for&nbsp;tonight</h1>
<p>When governments throw a lot of money at a project, it&#8217;s easy to get carried away by technological success, without examining the economics. 
When Apollo 11 reached the moon, all the pundits confidently stated that this would be the beginning of a new age: the Space Age. The reality is that we&#8217;ve never really made any use of the exploration of space, and it has brought mankind no tangible benefit. At its peak, the <span class="caps">US</span> Space program was burning through 5% of its <span class="caps">GDP</span>. This represented a huge loss of welfare for its citizens. Until recently, this sort of spending could have paid for free healthcare for all (until the 90&#8217;s the <span class="caps">UK</span> was spending of this order of <span class="caps">GDP</span> on its single-payer health service, the <span class="caps">NHS</span>).<br>
We had similar promises about the Atomic Age in the fifties. 
I would not want to downplay the success of the pharma companies in producing a vaccine against <span class="caps">SARS</span>-Cov2, but this was not the result of a lot of committees in Whitehall deciding what the country needed to spend resources on.
Sometimes, being reactive is a good&nbsp;thing.</p>
