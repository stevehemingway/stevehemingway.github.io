<p>I don&#8217;t know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she&#8217;ll&nbsp;die!</p>
<p>There was an old lady who swallowed a spider<br>

How absurd to swallow a&nbsp;bird!</p>

<p>She swallowed a horse. <br>
She died, of&nbsp;course.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the inspirating for the title of a piece by Bill Nelson.
It&#8217;s an academic piece, but he summarized it nicely <a href="https://morningconsult.com/opinions/i-dont-know-why-she-swallowed-a-fly/">here</a>.
It&#8217;s saying more or less what <a href="https://twitter.com/RudyHavenstein">Rudy Havenstein</a> has been saying on Twitter for a long while.
(No, it&#8217;s not the real Rudy, just his&nbsp;reincarnation.)</p>
<p>Bill explains, with the authority that comes with having been a senior figure at the Fed in the past, 
that the Fed has repeatedly tried to fix problems of its own creation by enacting policies and actions which create even bigger problems.
The most egregious is, obviously, the balance sheet, and <span class="caps">QE</span> ∞. 
Nelson points out that, as in Japan, the Fed now <em>is</em> the market for many securities, and any move it makes can create huge volatility.
The Fed itself expects that by 2023 the Fed balance sheet will be 39 percent of <span class="caps">GDP</span>, up from 6 percent in mid-2007. That is a lot, as this chart&nbsp;shows.</p>
<p><img src=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=GeAn alt="The Fed balance sheet" width="760px"></p>
<p>I suspect that the Fed knows perfectly well that it has to reverse the ridiculous stack of programs it has set up, but needs to manage this without spooking the markets, which has become so dependent on it.
I wonder if the current heavy reverse repo program is part of this process.
(Reverse repos, are when banks swap reserves for T-bills. It&#8217;s a Fed program, but it&#8217;s named from the point of view of the banks.)

<h2>The state of the&nbsp;market</h2>
<p>Chinese stocks, including $<span class="caps">HSTECH</span> and $<span class="caps">KWEB</span> are rallying. 
Maybe they&#8217;ve gone down&nbsp;enough.</p>
<p>Commodities going nowhere. The dip last Friday has been comprehensively bought. 
The <span class="caps">GSCI</span> (Goldman&#8217;s commodity index) is back to where it was in early May.
Bonds pretty flat, on a week or so timeline.
The dollar is high, <span class="caps">DX</span>=92, but has been higher (93.55 last week), and was around this level back in March.
10Y Treasury yields are back where they were a month&nbsp;ago.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to make money in such a meandering market.
Jackson Hole is happening this week.
Powell may announce violent tapering, but the odds are against&nbsp;it.</p>
