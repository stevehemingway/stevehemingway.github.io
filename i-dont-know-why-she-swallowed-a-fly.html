<h2>Bill&nbsp;Nelson</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>There was an old lady who swallowed a&nbsp;fly;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she&#8217;ll&nbsp;die!</p>
<p>There was an old lady who swallowed a spider<br>
That wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside&nbsp;her!</p>
<p>She swallowed the spider to catch the&nbsp;fly;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she&#8217;ll&nbsp;die!</p>
<p>There was an old lady who swallowed a bird;<br>
How absurd to swallow a&nbsp;bird!</p>
<p>She swallowed the bird to catch the spider<br>
That wriggled and jiggled and tickled inside&nbsp;her!</p>
<p>She swallowed the spider to catch the&nbsp;fly;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why she swallowed a fly - Perhaps she&#8217;ll die!
…
(several verses later) …
She swallowed a horse.
She died, of&nbsp;course.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the inspirating for the title of a piece by Bill Nelson. 
It&#8217;s an academic piece, but he summarized it nicely <a href="https://morningconsult.com/opinions/i-dont-know-why-she-swallowed-a-fly/">here</a>.
It&#8217;s saying more or less what <a href="https://twitter.com/RudyHavenstein">Rudy Havenstein</a> has been saying on Twitter for a long while.
(No, it&#8217;s not the real Rudy, just his&nbsp;reincarnation.)</p>
<p>Bill explains, with the authority that comes with having been a senior figure at the Fed in the past, 
that the Fed has repeatedly tried to fix problems of its own creation by enacting policies and actions which create even bigger problems.
The most egregious is, obviously, the balance sheet, and <span class="caps">QE</span> ∞. 
Nelson points out that, as in Japan, the Fed now <em>is</em> the market for many securities, and any move it makes can create huge&nbsp;volatility.</p>
<p>I suspect that the Fed knows perfectly well that it has to reverse the ridiculous stack of programs it has set up, but needs to manage this without spooking the markets, which has become so dependent on it.
I wonder if the current heavy reverse repo program is part of this process.
(Reverse repos, are when banks swap reserves for T-bills. It&#8217;s a Fed program, but it&#8217;s named from the point of view of the banks.)
