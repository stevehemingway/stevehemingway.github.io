</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h1>Friday 17th April&nbsp;2020</h1>
<p><span class="caps">OK</span>, I&#8217;ve kinda gone delta-neutral on my long long-dated puts on <span class="caps">TSLA</span>, <span class="caps">RUT</span> and <span class="caps">BA</span> with shorter-dated short puts. This was a smart move. The market has been rocketing lately, for no obvious reason, as usual. At least I haven&#8217;t been damaged too&nbsp;badly.</p>
<p>My big mistake was going long three contracts June <span class="caps">GC</span>. Gold, although it&#8217;s doing well, was smashed. A hedging position, short puts, offset some of the damage, but it still accounts for my&nbsp;downside.</p>
<p>My &#8220;incredible hulks&#8221; strategy seems not to be holed below the waterline, yet. Nothing spectacular though, as oil has been rallying, with incessant boosterism from the orange buffoon (who is, naturally, enjoying record approval&nbsp;ratings).</p>
<p>Anyway, I bought one <span class="caps">ESTX50</span>, because &#8220;if you can&#8217;t beat them, join&nbsp;them&#8221;.</p>
<p>I sold one <span class="caps">ZAR</span> (<span class="caps">ZAR</span>, <span class="caps">TRL</span>, and other weak currencies are going to get&nbsp;smashed).</p>
<p><span class="caps">EMB</span> looks a safe short <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4338000-emb-emerging-market-junk-bonds-sow-seeds-of-next-financial-crisis?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=seeking_alpha&amp;mail_subject=wingcapital-investments-emb-emerging-market-junk-bonds-could-sow-the-seeds-of-the-next-financial-crisis&amp;utm_campaign=rta-author-article&amp;utm_content=link-0">according to <span class="caps">SA</span></a>. You shorted <span class="caps">EMB</span> a while ago, via <span class="caps">CFD</span>, but it has done nothing so&nbsp;far.</p>
<p>Oddly enough <span class="caps">GILD</span> is rocketing, as there a rumour that Remdesivir, an anti-viral, is effective against Covid-19. <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3561615-exuberance-out-of-control-on-gilead-covid-baird%20">Exuberance &#8216;out of control&#8217; on Gilead/<span class="caps">COVID</span> -&nbsp;Baird</a></p>
<p>Article by Karen Ward in the <span class="caps">FT</span> saying that inflation was breaking higher. 100% of the comment disagreed, but at some point it really is going to&nbsp;happen.</p>
<p><a href="https://kedrosky.org/sendy/w/VLL9wpuednEnztnIzqj9kw/EIcX0BqqvQK8qooT55g892jA/JnPAwW2lOtN892JYgO2LUSEg">Great article about how even with early info it&#8217;s hard to make profits</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2020/04/13/cookin-with-gas/">Kuppy is keen on <span class="caps">NG</span></a>. <span class="caps">SD</span> (Sandridge) is one way of getting exposure. As he says, he&#8217;s been very wrong in the past. It looks very illiquid. Not sure what&#8217;s wrong with a contract of <span class="caps">NG</span>. The thesis is simple. Oil production is going to shut, cutting off the supply which is a byproduct of oil. Demand is holding up. Prices will&nbsp;rise.</p>
<h2>close</h2>
<p>Trying to get delta-neutral. Sold some <span class="caps">BA</span> puts to compensate for those expiring. Closed <span class="caps">GC</span> short hedge posn. You had a calendar spread, but you were not convinced about it. Sold a few more hulks. This seems to be a working strategy. Sold some <span class="caps">RUT</span> to compensate for expiry, to keep&nbsp;neutral.</p>
<p>Basically, <span class="caps">GC</span> killed you today. Everything else was sort of <span class="caps">OK</span>, even though it was a massive risk on&nbsp;day.</p>
