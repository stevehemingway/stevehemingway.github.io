<p>(This is written at about 5:30 pm <span class="caps">GMT</span>, so <span class="caps">US</span> markets are still open.)
This seems like another boring day.
Currencies, bonds, equity indexes seem pretty flat. Even $<span class="caps">BTC</span> moved only around 3%, which is about as stable as you&#8217;re going to get&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Something is happening with $<span class="caps">TSLA</span> that has dragged up the other Ponzi stocks, like $<span class="caps">RIDE</span>, $<span class="caps">NKLA</span>, $<span class="caps">GOTU</span> and 
$<span class="caps">LOOP</span>. </p>
<p>$<span class="caps">TRCH</span>, another Ponzi stock slumped 26%. See <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4406983-torchlight-0_35-value-at-25-percent-merged-company">here</a> for an explanation why.  Note that when this article was written, $<span class="caps">TRCH</span> was trading at about $1.5. It is still above $5. This is the problem of identifying a&nbsp;fraud. </p>
<p>Oil ground higher. Most energy stocks were up, and copper and other miners.
Range Resources ($<span class="caps">RRC</span>) was up 9%. This is a natural gas company, involved in fracking.
This might be a better nat. gas play than the commodity itself, via futures.
<em>Not investment&nbsp;advice.</em></p>
<h2>Fed and <span class="caps">MBS</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://thesoundingline.com/?mailpoet_router&amp;endpoint=track&amp;action=click&amp;data=WyIxNDM3IiwiMWk3MmtvbXlvZndnczQ0ZzhjYzg0Y284azA4b3Nvc2ciLCIxNDg2IiwiNzllMDUzYWQ0ODM5IixmYWxzZV0">Our Problem in a Nutshell: Why Is the Fed Still Buying $40 Billion a Month of&nbsp;Mortgages?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The $120 billion-a-month <span class="caps">QE</span> program that the Federal Reserve has been running since last Spring includes $40 billion-a-month of Mortgage Backed Securities (<span class="caps">MBS</span>).</p>
<p>In other words, the Fed is buying $480 billion of <span class="caps">MBS</span> a year, a pace equivalent to roughly $74,000 per home sold in the <span class="caps">US</span> this year or about 25% of the value of current home sales. If you buy a home this year, there is a decent chance that the Federal Reserve will end up holding your&nbsp;mortgage.</p>
<p>Not too surprisingly, home prices are screaming higher at the fastest pace since 2006. That was right before the last housing bubble burst in spectacular&nbsp;fashion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the Sounding Line, sounding off again about the problem with the Fed. 
With Blackrock buying up a lot of single family houses, this seems just wrong. 
I sort of understand why <span class="caps">QE</span> is needed (although I doubt if it creates inflation), but buying commercial, long-dated paper seems&nbsp;wrong.</p>
<h2>Why did gold sell&nbsp;off?</h2>
<p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4435595-gold-what-i-think-about-the-recent-selloff?mail_subject=must-read-gold-thoughts-about-the-recent-selloff">This article says that it is unfathomable.</a>
Well, I agree, but  in the short run I&#8217;d prefer to say out of&nbsp;gold.</p>
<p>Basically, it doesn&#8217;t make sense for other real assets to be rallying against gold. 
Real rates are strongly negative, which a positive for the metal: <span class="caps">TIPS</span> are yielding something like&nbsp;-2.5%.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just a herd reaction, I guess. Some inflation hawks have moved money into crypto, but I am not sure how much longer that is going on.
In the short run, all markets are voting machines. And people don&#8217;t like gold right now, and because they don&#8217;t they convince themselves that we&#8217;re heading for deflation. Or the other way&nbsp;around.</p>
<h2>Twitter</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/coloradotravis/status/1407488962847936513?s=20">This is a great thread that makes the point that money now is not the same as money at some point in the future, as they are not subsitutes, but that they can be traded and the price of the trade is the discount factor, i.e. the interest rate.</a> I haven&#8217;t done justice to this great explanation, so you should follow the link.
It&#8217;s explains why monetary policy cannot create inflation <em>on its own</em>. </p>
