<h2>Lacey calls the&nbsp;crash</h2>
<p>Lacy Hunt, the doyen of commentators on the bond market, and chief economist at Hoisington Investment Management<br>
<a href="https://hoisington.com/pdf/HIM2022Q1NP.pdf">has spoken</a>. His bulletin is titled&nbsp;&#8220;Disaster.&#8221; </p>
<p>Hunt has been a bond bull longer than most people on the planet have been alive, but now he thinks that the Fed is perilously close to losing control of inflation.
It may now be too late to get the toothpaste back in the tube.
He looks at various historical parallels, including the 1972/73 period, and concludes that the monetary easing to get us through the pandemic, 
just like the one needed to finance the Vietnam War, is going to kindle inflation&nbsp;expectations.</p>
<p>He also points out that the inflation which is already being experienced is causing economic harm to a very large part of the <span class="caps">US</span> population. 
He doesn&#8217;t say it, but I will. These people will not be kind to the Democrats in the mid term elections, nor are they likely to be kind in the 2024 presidential election. 
We are going back to Trump, presumably, who will definitely lean on Powell to keep rate&nbsp;low.</p>
<p>Hunt is always worth reading. He points out that the &#8220;dual mandate&#8221; (which is actually three goals: full employment, stable prices and stable bond prices) is undeliverable in practice.
I am not sure that I&#8217;d describe Hunt as a bond bear, but he&#8217;s certainly not very bullish at the moment.
There have been many false dawns for bond bears, and this may be another. Even if we are not at the end of the great bond bull market, 
the end must be within our lifetimes&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>What is unsaid in Hunt&#8217;s bulletin who exactly faces &#8216;disaster&#8217; as a result of the Fed&#8217;s faulty monetary policy.
The text sympathizes those on fixed incomes, who are in their old age, dependent on pensions which have no indexing.
Unsaid, the other group which faces disaster are people who manage long-only bond funds. I suspect that Hunt is also a pensioner. Disaster indeed, but an opportunity for&nbsp;some.</p>
<h2>Macron</h2>
<p>The Economist, the <span class="caps">FT</span> and the Sunday Times all reacted with a huge sigh of relief to the prospect of Macron winning (or being likely to win) the presidential election in France.
I&#8217;m pretty sure these papers never failed to use the epithet &#8220;far right&#8221; to Marine le Pen.
I am not French, and I am sure that some of Le Pen&#8217;s policies are fairly extreme.
She seems to have focussed on transfer payments to those who suffer most from inflation and who have fewest resources.
I get it that populists advocate their policies, shamelessly, in an attempt to obtain power, before revealing their more
socially unacceptable policies. 
I am sure that the mainstream media in France hate Le Pen as much as <em>les bien pensants</em> of the <span class="caps">UK</span> mainstream media.
This makes her vote share of 42% pretty impressive, and will put huge pressure on Macron&#8217;s new administration 
to pursue populist and (arguably) inflationary policies&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>The fact is that if we head for a recession, the best way out of it is to redistribute income from those with a relatively low propensity to save, 
i.e. the very rich, and funnel it to the poor, especially the working poor.
I, like Hunt, am not a believer in the Phillips Curve, and I think this would be far better than
trying to find infrastructure projects, or build windmills over the&nbsp;country.</p>
<h2>The&nbsp;Yen</h2>
<p>The yen has been the currency that defied covered interest rate parity for so long, maybe that&#8217;s coming to an end.
