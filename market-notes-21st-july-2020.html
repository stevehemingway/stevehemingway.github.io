<p><img alt="pic" src="https://compoundadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/tesla-buble-7-6-1.png"></p>
<p>Well, probably, but this has been true repeatedly in the past year or so.
Nobody I follow predicts anything but $<span class="caps">TSLA</span> becoming $<span class="caps">TSLAQ</span>, but this is because I&#8217;m human and I like to follow people who confirm my&nbsp;priors. </p>
<h2>In other&nbsp;news</h2>
<p>Forex: <span class="caps">AUD</span> continues to climb vs <span class="caps">USD</span>. <span class="caps">GBP</span> has been strong recently, 
but given the huge levels of gilt issuance it is hard to see it stay high.
I&#8217;m tempted to sell against <span class="caps">JPY</span> 
Commods: <span class="caps">SI</span> is going up, gold less so.
Fixed Income: Chile, <span class="caps">HK</span>, <span class="caps">SK</span>, Mexico yields all going up. 
Turkey, <span class="caps">SA</span> and some other developing markets (e.g. Bulgaria) going down.
Developed market yield practically flat.
Equities generally going up: it&#8217;s another risk-on&nbsp;day!</p>
<p>Robin Brooks <a href="https://twitter.com/RobinBrooksIIF/status/1285541976075431936">reckons</a> that the massive amount of stimulus in the <span class="caps">USA</span> will be dollar positive. 
I don&#8217;t really see it myself, but Brooks is a serious&nbsp;commentator.</p>
<h2>Precious&nbsp;metals</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5ee9e268769b5613837afb5c">My list of miners</a> includes a mixture of copper, silver <span class="amp">&amp;</span> gold producers.
I can&#8217;t claim any expertise in this area.
Metals have been on a roll for a while, but lumber has also been on a roll, which is unusual.
In fact, over the last few days, lumber has been trending down, so maybe we are going into a risk-off world.
I am not sure that precious metals necessarily are safe assets,
but T-bonds are sooo expensive now, they are at least worth a look.
There seem to be investors who don&#8217;t trust any form of gold other than those which they can bury in a hole in their garden.
Call me a neophile, but I&#8217;m reasonable confident that Comex will not rip me&nbsp;off.</p>
<h2>Housing</h2>
<p>I can&#8217;t bring myself to believe that Covid-19 is bullish for housing. 
<a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/17/pent-up-supply-floods-san-francisco-housing-market-most-since-housing-bust/">This post</a> from Wolf Richer suggests that it&#8217;s not going to be in San Francisco. 
<a href="https://www.idiosyncraticwhisk.com/">Kevin Erdmann</a> has always said that cities like <span class="caps">SF</span> drive demand elsewhere, because the supply in them is absolutely constrained, so the demand for close-enough-subsitutes goes up.
The economics of housing are difficult: a house is as unlike an apple or a widget as its possible to be while still being, in some sense, an economic good which can be bought and sold.
I think Erdmann prefers to think in terms of &#8220;housing services&#8221; (with rent as a price, not the capitalized price),
but I haven&#8217;t read his book and I find his explanations on various podcasts I&#8217;ve listened too pretty confusing, 
although he seems to have a clear idea in his own mind of the drivers.
It doesn&#8217;t help that he confines himself to the <span class="caps">US</span> market, which I don&#8217;t know or care about.
I&#8217;d like to apply his methods to the <span class="caps">UK</span>, but so far I&#8217;ve&nbsp;failed.</p>
<h2>Airlines</h2>
<p><a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/14/delta-issues-mother-of-all-earnings-reports-passenger-revenue-94-through-june-30-plans-to-stay-alive-until-demand-returns-which-remains-uncertain/">Bad news </a> doesn&#8217;t seem to dent the share price &#8230; until it&nbsp;does.</p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>Markets seem very &#8220;risk on&#8221; today: <span class="caps">SPX</span> up 0.2%, <span class="caps">IWM</span> up 1.4% (although <span class="caps">NDX</span> down 1.1%, afer a recent terrific run).
Energy jumped: <span class="caps">XL</span>$ + 6%, but soft commodities mainly down (wheat up ~10% over a month, so deserves a pause).
Global 10yr yields all up, except Germany: presumably some sort of response to the recent <span class="caps">EU</span> budget and what Germany will contribute to it.
<span class="caps">FX</span> largely&nbsp;flat. </p>
<p>I listened to Mark Spiegel chatting to Chris Irons on the <span class="caps">QTR</span> podcast. 
They are both gold bugs, so the end got rather boring. 
I&#8217;d rather listen to&nbsp;Schiff.</p>
