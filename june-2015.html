<p>The Annual Meeting of the Parish on Wednesday the 6th of May, where
parking in Knebworth was one of the more burning issues under
discussion. Opinion in the village is sharply divided between those who
welcome the increased space available for shoppers, and those who worry
about availability of parking spaces for those who work in the village,
and those whose vehicles need to be near their place of work. I am in
discussion with <span class="caps">NHDC</span> to see if the balance between the needs of
residents and local businesses can be improved.
Parking as a wider issue in the village has not disappeared from the
agenda. I am trying to revive <span class="caps">KPIG</span>, the Knebworth Parking Initiative
Group, but I will have to wait until the portfolio holder for transport
is announced before I can make much more progress with this. Fairly
extensive changes have been made to parking in the village, and the
District is reluctant to deploy resources to change things even more,
unless there is compelling evidence that this will improve matters.
Clearly, the best outcome would be a new, large, free carpark near the
centre of the village, but reviving <span class="caps">KPIG</span> will not deliver this.
There were no District or County elections this year for Knebworth.
However, there were a number of seats contested elsewhere in the
District, and your new Council will have a significantly different
composition to that of the civic year just ended. Responses to the
consultation on the emerging Local Plan will continue to be processed by
hard-pressed officers until August or September, but when the report is
ready I am sure that the Local Plan will once again hit the headlines.
The Annual Meeting of the (<span class="caps">NHDC</span>) Council is scheduled take place on the
21st May. After this I will know which committees I am on, and who the
chairmen and vice-chairmen are of the various committees the make up the
District Council. I will be on the Southern Rural Committee, as this is
the one that deals with matters relating to the villages in the south of
the district, but I do not know yet which other committees (if any) I
shall be on.
June will be a month of fêtes and festivals. Do not forget to put the
details of the Knebworth Festival in your diaries. Full details can be
found elsewhere in this issue. I will be attending most of the events
and look forward to seeing you at&nbsp;them.</p>
