<p>It was a public holiday in the <span class="caps">UK</span> today, and I think across much of the developed world.
<span class="caps">US</span> markets appeared to be open, but I didn&#8217;t check the&nbsp;volumes.</p>
<p>Stocks bounced back, but only after a very volatile trading day.
The <span class="caps">FANG</span>+ gang did well, Tesla rising 3.7%, but still no higher than the level it was at last October.
Bonds were generally down (yields up) in all but the markets with a significant degree of credit risk (Brazil for example, but also Russia, India, South Africa <em>and China</em>).</p>
<p><span class="caps">DXY</span> was up again. This is turning into a one-way bet. 
The argument is that there is a dollar shortage: a shortage of collateral and safe assets, which is driving up the price, 
i.e. rates, for <span class="caps">USD</span>, which will cause a downturn.
For a fairly heretical, but so far correct, interpretion, see <a href="https://alhambrapartners.com/2022/04/22/im-officially-calling-it-euro-5/">I‚Äôm ‚ÄòOfficially‚Äô Calling It: Euro$ #5</a>.</p>
<h2>Charity</h2>
<p>The left is about rescuing the oppressed. The idea is to give them money (i.e. resources), which can be taken from the rich.
Charity is based on the same principle.
For various reasons, I&#8217;ve been exposed to quite a lot of advertising on daytime <span class="caps">UK</span> <span class="caps">TV</span>.
A huge part of this is by charities, who show all sorts of heart-rending footage of people and animals in&nbsp;misery.</p>
<p>I am not sure what the solution for animals is: maybe impose more severe penalties for those who break the law by mis-treating animals.
For humans, almost certainly the solution is to stop the rulers of their country siphoning off money to Switzerland and the <span class="caps">UK</span>, to name just two of the many western countries where kleptocrats to choose to keep their&nbsp;money.</p>
<p>I understand that we have a desire to help people, but the citizens of (for example) Nigeria do not need charity.
They need less corruption at the top.
It&#8217;s hard for private charities to do much about this, but it is something that governments could do, but choose never to attempt.
The <span class="caps">UK</span> government seems willing to turn a blind eye to all this.
It&#8217;s not as though what I&#8217;m saying is not common knowledge (see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/26/uk-sells-arms-to-nearly-80-of-countries-under-restrictions-shows-report">this</a> for example).
It&#8217;s just that politicians are afraid of telling the truth because &#8230; why? Because they want to become consultants for <span class="caps">BAE</span> Systems? Because they know that <span class="caps">UK</span> voters don&#8217;t give a damn (except they would dearly love for Nigerians not to flee from their home country to escape the poverty which is a consequence of bad governance).
It would just be nice to see a single <span class="caps">MP</span> come out in public and call out a kleptocrat, before he has invaded a neighbouring&nbsp;country.</p>
