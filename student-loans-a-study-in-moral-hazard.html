<h2>Funding for higher&nbsp;education</h2>
<p>One of the arguments for conservatism and even Conservatism, when it had an ideology, is that the <em>status quo ante</em> has a magical property that no untested proposal has, which is that all its faults are already known and 
understood.
In the Blair government of the 2000s, a decision was made to allow many more young people to go to university, but to fund them in the way that previous generations had been funded was considered too&nbsp;expensive.</p>
<p>The solution was to lend kids the money, and then get them to repay out of their (generally higher) salaries in the graduate-level jobs they&#8217;d go into.
This was a disaster, which, surely, we should have foreseen. When 10% of a school cohort go to university, the value of a degree has to be higher than when 50% does, unless you believe that
ability to get into university doesn&#8217;t correlate at all with ability to earn&nbsp;money. </p>
<p>Of course, you can&#8217;t get blood out of a stone, so repayment of loans is &#8220;income contingent.&#8221; In other words, the people who study sports science will never have to pay back any of their debt.
The moral hazard this creates is highly visible&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>Having market lenders take the risk on students in financing their degrees would be fine. If you are accepted to do an <span class="caps">MBA</span> at Harvard Business School, you&#8217;ll have no problem finding private finance. 
The market would probably fund you to study computer science at Cambridge, with no problems. 
But Labour would never agree to such a model, which is why we have the mess we have&nbsp;today.</p>
<p>People would say, &#8220;but nobody will be funded to study arts subjects.&#8221; I think you&#8217;d find that Lit. Hum. undergrads at Oxford would manage <span class="caps">OK</span>.</p>
<p>The fundamental problem is that the educational establishment is extremely unwilling to accept that a university degree&#8217;s main value is due to its signalling ability, not the knowledge and skills imparted by 
dons. I don&#8217;t think anyone dares take on &#8220;The Blob&#8221; as Dominic Cummings so appositely called&nbsp;it.</p>
