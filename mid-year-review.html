<h2>Looking back over two&nbsp;quarters</h2>
<p><img alt="6M chart of ACWI" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/xAN5pjmf/"></p>
<p>World stockmarkets (here represented by the <span class="caps">ACWI</span> <span class="caps">ETF</span>, which tracks the global, market-cap weighted, equity level), have had a relentlessly bad six months.
The culprit is the tightening of monetary conditions.
This is probably going to go on. 
Personal Consumption Expenditure, the Fed&#8217;s preferred measure of inflation came in at 6.3%, YoY.
I think this was a shade above expectations, but it&#8217;s clearly too high.
The <span class="caps">PCE</span> excludes all sorts of stuff (food, energy, transport, etc.) that the Fed doesn&#8217;t like to think about as contributing to the cost of living.
(I jest, but only&nbsp;slightly.)</p>
<p><img alt="6M chart of 10Y yield (x10)" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/gWF92FcC/"></p>
<p><span class="caps">US</span> long-dated yields have risen. Tightening has pushed down the yield by 60bp over the last few weeks, 
which might indicate that the markets think that the Fed has won.
Or, it might just be that bond market weakening had just got ahead of itself, and needs to pull&nbsp;back.</p>
<p><img alt="6M Brent Crude (Last Day) futures" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/8Y5RWGpQ/"></p>
<p>Oil has behaved quite oddly. Basically, it was going up steadily, until 24 Feb, when Russia invaded Ukraine, then it shot up to $32/barrel in the first week of March, but since then it has has resolutely bounced around about $112, not really straying very far from that level, however bad the news about production stoppages or rampant&nbsp;demand.</p>
<p>Oil and inflation have to be closely intertwined. 
Oil is a direct or indirect input cost in almost everything we consume.
Either oil catches up with inflation, or inflation is crushed by weakening oil prices.
Of course Zero Carbon initiatives are complicating matters, and might force down demand, but <a href="https://www.gisreportsonline.com/r/peak-oil-demand/">it&#8217;s likely to be a couple of decades before
we see oil demand turning the corner</a>.</p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>Oil dropped as high inflation spooked markets into expecting more tightening.
Or portfolio managers dumped stock to kitchen sink their dire quarters in the hope of getting as low a mark as possible against which their Q3 
returns will be judged. Your guess is as good as&nbsp;mine.</p>
<p>The Yen strengthened, equities crashed, as did most commodities, bonds rallied.
This was a classic risk-off&nbsp;day.</p>

<p>This is a thread. It&#8217;s quite subtle. It suggests that &#8216;Project Zimbabwe&#8217; is some way off, even though it is on its&nbsp;way.</p>
