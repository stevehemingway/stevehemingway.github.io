## [Dieter Helm calls plans for net-zero by 2050 "hopelessly unrealistic"](https://gaspathways.com/-779?msclkid=c9412e93cd2011eca5b77f6689e7e5f6)

This probably isn't a surprise to anybody. 
If we, as a society, want to reduce the amount of CO2 we produce, we can take action to deliver this.
If we refuse to buy our electricity from suppliers who use fossil fuels to generate it, then the world will have less CO2 going 
into the air.
But this will come at a cost, which can be transferred to others, in theory, by the government.

I know the argument about externalities, that by using coal we impose costs on others, which are not born by either the consumer or the producer. But the government could address this by imposing a tax on consumption of carbon, rather than building lots of windmills and solar panels, which, by themselves, do not reduce consumption at all.

I know that each of us, individually, can't supply our energy needs by building a windmill in his garden, but I am far from convinced that the government somehow magically makes costs go away by taking away our individual choice about where we get our energy from. Especially when we are told that zero-carbon electricity will be so cheap.
