## Current Views

• We are still in the haze of the COVID policy response but when the smoke clears: no fiscal juice, high gas prices, and weaker housing markets will push the US economy off its current robust course.

• If we can get back to 2% Fed Funds and 5% 10-year rates and stay there for a bit, Mark would feel hopeful that some return to normalcy is possible. Positive yields are a fundamental feature of properly-functioning capitalism. Currently we are in a never-ending cycle where we bounce off, then return to the zero bound.
