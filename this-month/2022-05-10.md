Oil spike will be deflationary just like every other oil spike in the past as it weighs on discretionary spending.

## Musky Twitter

[Matt Levine writes even more about Musk and Twitter.](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-05-04/someone-hacked-a-merger)
Whatever you think about Levine's takes on the latest news, one has to admire his prolificacy (yes, it is a word, but I had to look it up). 
He comments on stuff which is baffling to everyone, which is why most commentators steer well clear of it.

is utterly wonderful, imho.

For what it's worth, I think Musk is a psychopath, but I have to agree that if anyone can make Twitter's stock price go to the moon, it's him.
