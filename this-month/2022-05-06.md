title: You can't short a cult

## Wrap

This was a risk-off day. Equity markets were pummelled. It was Europe's turn today.
Generally, FX and commodities were not too seriously affected.
The 10Y yield on USTs crept up to 3.09%.

## Hospital errors

I thought that [this](https://macroops.substack.com/p/winners-evolve?r=nmbt&s=r&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=email) was interesting. It's about how good management and a good team spirit encourages communication, and owning up to mistakes.
It references a study done in hospitals where the error rate in good team places appeared to be an order of magnitude higher than in ones with a bad esprit de corps.
The reality is that in the latter case, the mistakes were simply buried, in some cases literally.

I fear that the NHS must suffer from this.
Anecdotal evidence is that management there is execrable.
It suffers from being a monoposony employer of many types of professionals.
I am fortunate in having minimal contact with the service, but the stats seem terrible.
[This famous study](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jun/17/nhs-health?msclkid=e1ed52a0cd4411ecbabe8879b3ef9e94), with a completely straight face, as only the Guardian can muster, admits _The only serious black mark against the NHS was its poor record on keeping people alive._

Stats on healthcare are notoriously gamed, so I won't try to quote any, but it just seems clear that we have a service with dire productivity.

Yup, it's just a cult, and you can't short a cult.
