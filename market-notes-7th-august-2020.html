</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h2>Morning&nbsp;call</h2>
<p>The markets are mainly dead, with a couple of&nbsp;exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Silver has caught fire, overtaking gold in percentage increase&nbsp;terms,</li>
<li>The Turkish Lira seems in deep&nbsp;trouble. </li>
</ul>
<p>I see a lot of press coverage of gold (and a bit of silver) and the inevitable return to discussion of inflation.
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2895520f-5d23-4add-a431-7cc954fb78a4">This article</a> from the <span class="caps">FT</span> pointed out that the yield on TIPs is now negative, i.e. investors expect real yields to turn negative.
I don&#8217;t follow <span class="caps">TIPS</span> prices, but looking at <a href="https://koyfin.com/s/xdBKivOUvy">a likely looking <span class="caps">TIPS</span> <span class="caps">ETF</span> price series</a> it would seem that the markets expectation of inflation is endlessly rising.
It&#8217;s hard to take a market position on this: maybe an <span class="caps">ETF</span> is the best way, but it seems unnatural to buy something which costs money to own. 
I wish I had a crystal ball, but if press coverage is any measure of inflation being about to break out,
it is going to&nbsp;happen.</p>
<p>Equity indexes area  shade lower, but they don&#8217;t seem to stay down for long, which is not surprising given the tsunami of liquidity that is being unleashed by the central&nbsp;banks. </p>
<h2>What I&#8217;m&nbsp;reading</h2>
<p>The Greenlight Investors Letter, which can be found by googling or <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4364188-greenlight-capital-q2-2020-letter">here</a>, is worth a look.
Einhorn is keen on $<span class="caps">BHF</span>, Brighthouse Financial, which, as far as I can tell, 
is not related to the <span class="caps">UK</span> company of a similar name.
As widely reported, he&#8217;s convinced that inflation is coming and that $<span class="caps">TSLA</span> is a fraud.
I believe he&#8217;s right, but I also believe that it could be a very long time before it&#8217;s possible to make money out of these insights, if ever.
I don&#8217;t spend a lot of time on Yahoo Finance, but they have a lot of stuff. They have the earnings call transcript for Greenlight](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/edited-transcript-glre-oq-earnings-233910148.html), which is more than is available on the <span class="caps">FT</span> or Reuters (that I can find,&nbsp;free).</p>
<p><a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/06/end-of-qe-week-8-feds-assets-fall-by-4-billion-for-the-week-down-224-billion-since-june-10/">Wolf Richer has more to say about the Fed and inflation</a>.</p>
<h2>Closing&nbsp;Bell</h2>
<p><span class="caps">USD</span> seems to have sagged against everything.
Equities mixed. <span class="caps">VIX</span> down.
Commodities down (in spite of a weak dollar: what&#8217;s happening?).
Summary: no clear direction. 
Not sure what conclusion to draw. Things move&nbsp;forward?</p>
