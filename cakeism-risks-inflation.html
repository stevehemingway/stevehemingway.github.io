<h2>Recession or&nbsp;not?</h2>
<p>Will we have a recession? 
If inflation hits 10%, it seems almost impossible to avoid.
We&#8217;d have to increase nominal <span class="caps">GDP</span> by more than 10% to avoid real <span class="caps">GDP</span> going down, 
for two quarters.
The <span class="caps">BLS</span> (or some quango in the <span class="caps">USA</span>) is, maybe, going to redefine what a recession is,
so that although real <span class="caps">GDP</span> will go down for a couple of quarters,
Biden can say &#8220;No, I did not cause a recession.&#8221;
Really, who cares? 
If the economy holds steady, but edges down for six months, maybe it&#8217;s not the end of the world.
Especially if all your debts are lower by 5% in real terms, and your pay is going up by 10% a&nbsp;year.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve had anaemic growth since &#8230; 1980, everywhere in the west, but certainly in the <span class="caps">UK</span>.
This has been during a time of collapsing inflation.
Maybe transferring some real resources from creditors to debtors is exactly what the economy&nbsp;needs.</p>
<p>The 75bp hike by the Fed yesterday, in the teeth of collapsing consumer confidence suggests that the only thing the Fed cares about is inflation.
Well, supposedly, <span class="caps">CB</span>&#8217;s superpower is the ability to crush inflation. We&#8217;ll see whether J Poww is really just a new Wizard of&nbsp;Oz.</p>

<p>Powell blinked in 2018, when rates hit 2.5%. 
Headline inflation now makes it very difficult for him to do so again, in spite of the secret third mandate to keep the stock market elevated.
Maybe not so&nbsp;secret.</p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>Generally today was pretty uneventful.
The <span class="caps">US</span> economy contracted for a second quarter, by an annualized rate of 0.9%, which is pretty mild. Stocks went up moderately, yields down, commodities all over the place (Brent Crude going in the opposite direction to <span class="caps">WTI</span>). </p>
<p>Currencies didn&#8217;t move much. I guess it was a slightly risk-on day, but it&#8217;s a holiday weekend in the <span class="caps">USA</span> and probably most of the desks were&nbsp;deserted.</p>
<h2>Meta</h2>
<p><a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/faceblocked">Matt Stoller explains why the <span class="caps">FB</span> strategy of buying up the competition no longer implementable</a> Matt is a great guy, but is focussed on the injustices and bad general economic consequences of monopolistic practices in the <span class="caps">USA</span>.
I tend to read his stuff to understand why companies have most pricing power.
Warren Buffett&#8217;s strategy is only to buy monopolists, or at least those firms which face limited&nbsp;competition.</p>
<p>Although Stoller is not offering an actual analysis of the stock price, if <span class="caps">FB</span> no longer has the ability to knock out the competition it would seem logical that it should no longer deserve the same multiple.
I guess it&#8217;s trading on a P/E of 13, which isn&#8217;t too demanding, compared to a P/E of 19 for $<span class="caps">GOOG</span>.</p>
<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>Boris Johnson&#8217;s &#8216;cakeism&#8217; is no more than <span class="caps">MMT</span> in Eton tails.
It&#8217;s the idea that you can have tax cuts and more public spending.
It really is the idea that there is a magic money tree, at least if you are deemed to be deserving (bankers needing bailouts, <span class="caps">PPE</span> procurers, <span class="caps">PWC</span> writing a track and trace app, <span class="caps">HS2</span>).
It&#8217;s what people want. Liz Truss understands this, and offers it (but avoids the &#8216;C&#8217; word), 
Rishi says that cakeism leads to inflation, which must be stopped by more taxes, at least until just before the next&nbsp;election. </p>
<p>Truss is going to win. Interest rates are going to go up, just in time for the Boomers to get more income on their&nbsp;savings.</p>
