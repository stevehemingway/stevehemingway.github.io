<h2>The <span class="caps">US</span> Treasury curve&nbsp;inversion</h2>
<p>There are a lot of measures of yields and discount curves.
Looking at raw T-bill yields is not ideal, because they have cash flows at all sorts of dates.
However, there is clearly a material difference between the duration of the 10Y note and the 2Y one, and if you track that over time it does tend to signal trouble&nbsp;ahead.</p>
<p>We are now facing&nbsp;trouble.</p>
<p><img alt="10Y-2Y yield, USA" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/LoO14JGk/"></p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>Oil and other commodites slumped. Near month of <span class="caps">WTI</span> dropped 3.2%.
Coal and gas were up, but mostly commodities were down.
The further dated futures didn&#8217;t go down much.
It&#8217;s dangerous to read to much into this (I think the market makers just widen their spreads on the more illiquid contracts on a day like this, without having a settled view of how the forward curve is likely to change&nbsp;shape).</p>
<p>Equities were more or less uniformly bullish. Does this mean we&#8217;re in for a recession? Possibly: stocks actually can go up in a recession. After all, labour costs and debt service costs are likely to go down. Sales to but&nbsp;&#8230;</p>
<p>The 10Y yield went down 5bp. It is now around 2.8%. Supposedly, the long-term rate is the same as R-star (R*) beloved parameters of the Fed&nbsp;models.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The BoE published a great paper breaking down the drivers behind Global R*, the equilibrium real rate at which the global economy can deliver its potential growth<br><br>In short, the world needs negative (!) real yields to hold steady due to very bad demographics and poor productivity <a href="https://t.co/b2rK46E2kX">pic.twitter.com/b2rK46E2kX</a></p>&mdash; Alf (@MacroAlf) <a href="https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1558918633622974464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2022</a></blockquote>

<p>Michael Burry bought $<span class="caps">GEO</span>, a private prison stock, and sold everything else.

<p>I haven&#8217;t a clue where the stock market is going, but I feel that it&#8217;s due for a 
violent correction. Maybe it&#8217;s time to go long volatility with some one- or two-month tight strangles or straddles on <span class="caps">SPY</span> or similar. Implied vols on <span class="caps">US</span> equities seem very&nbsp;low.</p>
<h2>Personal&nbsp;Thoughts</h2>
<p>Unions have been purged from low-entry-barrier jobs the private sector. The resulting collapse in the share of income received by the working class (&#8216;middle class&#8217; in <span class="caps">US</span>-speak) has been&nbsp;huge.</p>
<p>Strangely, or not, unions have thrived in the public sector, and in some so-called professions.
Luigi and Bethany discuss this in <a href="https://www.capitalisnt.com/episodes/are-workers-benefiting-from-the-union-boom">their latest <em>Capitalismisn&#8217;t</em> podcast</a>.
Luigi is very eloquent in his contempt for the American Medical Association (the <span class="caps">US</span> equivalent of the <span class="caps">BMA</span>) in making reform of the dysfunction <span class="caps">US</span> healthcare system. (I am not an expert on <span class="caps">US</span> politics, but <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/barack-obama-was-a-successful-president">this take</a>) seems completely wrong. If Obama did a good job in reforming <span class="caps">US</span> healtcare, I hate to think what it would look like if had done a bad&nbsp;job. </p>
<p>Unions leaders are generally dinosaurs, from central casting. No wonder young people do not join them. 
They have a terrible reputation as employers themselves, and when they make gains for their members, it&#8217;s always at the expense of the public, whose self-interest is always too dilute to resist their efforts&nbsp;successfully.</p>
<p>It will be very interesting to see what happens if unions manage to make some inroads into Amazon and Starbucks&nbsp;facilities. </p>
<p>As I frequently say, a red-hot labour market is the best possible support for employees.
I desperately hope that stupid central bankers do not do what they always do when labour markets are strong and create a recession just to &#8216;cool&#8217; the labour market.
Somehow, central bankers never seem to think that asset markets need&nbsp;cooling.</p>
