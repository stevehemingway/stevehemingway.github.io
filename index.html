</footer><!-- /.post-info --><h1>Energy</h1>
<p>I&#8217;m quite bullish on energy. 
Commodities have been weak for a long time, and the biggest (&#8216;consumable&#8217;) commodity of oil is oil.
The relatively strong dollar has held down commodity prices, and it has weakened, but now it&#8217;s going back up again.
Short dollar is supposedly the most crowded trade in the universe, so it&#8217;s easy to imagine all those dollar shorts covering as the <span class="caps">USD</span> rises again, spiking the oil rally, and with it prices of downstream oil&nbsp;producers.</p>
<p>Added to all this is the massive capital injection into &#8216;green&#8217; energy. Even if wind power ends up costing ten times the price of energy from oil, this is not necessarily a reason that we don&#8217;t end up using it, because all governments agree that free markets are fine, as long as they are not used for important goods and&nbsp;services.</p>
<p>I remain convinced that $<span class="caps">XOM</span> is a better bet than $<span class="caps">TSLA</span>, but I am not sure that I&#8217;d want to go out very far on that particular limb, given the huge political and geopolitical risks which may affect both&nbsp;stocks.</p>
<h1>Bonds</h1>
<p><img alt="359e6f109b00f2ad2d655ca09411a573.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/359e6f109b00f2ad2d655ca09411a573.png"></p>
<p>Ten year yields are lagging developed markets <span class="caps">PMI</span> surveys. Both should be strongly correlated with future&nbsp;inflation.</p>
<h1>Grant is gloomy about&nbsp;bonds</h1>
<p>The problem is that the <span class="caps">US</span> Treasury has to raise a lot of money, but without spooking bond markets. Things could get interesting, but for sure the primary dealers are going to try to shake out the bond shorts before the&nbsp;auctions!!</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.grantspub.com/resources/commentary.cfm">Grant&#8217;s Almost Daily Commentary</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Buckle up: A potentially pivotal week is in store for fixed-income investors, as the Treasury department is set to auction a total of $120 billion across 3-, 10- and 30-year matures between Tuesday and Thursday. Recall that the disastrous Feb. 25 auction of $62 billion worth of seven-year notes, featuring a yield well above the when issued price along with the weakest bid-to-cover ratio on record, helped catalyze a sharp selloff in Treasurys. Currently the 10- and 30-year yields remain at their highest since the pandemic got&nbsp;underway. </p>
<p>Of course, signs of stirring inflation (including a 25% year-over-year bulge in M2 money supply), in tandem with a Federal Reserve actively striving for higher consumer prices, present a daunting backdrop for would-be Treasury holders in the context of a near 40-year bull market. “Until investors are comfortable knowing the Fed’s tolerance for higher rates, it is unlikely that most buyers will want to ‘catch a falling knife’ for higher yields,” Meghan Swiber, <span class="caps">U.S.</span> rates strategist at Bank of America, tells the Financial&nbsp;Times. </p>
<p>One fundamental gauge suggests Uncle Sam’s creditors may have reason for worry.  Bloomberg notes this afternoon that, with economist consensus calling for a 7.6% advance in nominal output this year, the 600 basis point gap between <span class="caps">GDP</span> expectations and the 10-year Treasury yield is at its widest since&nbsp;1966. </p>

<p>From Trading&nbsp;Economics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wall Street rallied on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones up more than 200 points after hitting another intraday record and the S&amp;P 500 rising 2% as investors focus on prospects of a strong economic recovery and further stimulus. The House is expected to pass the $1.9 trillion aid bill tomorrow. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq added more than 4% after sinking into correction territory the day before, as Treasury yields retreated ahead of sales in the coming days and tech shares recovered some ground. Tesla stocks outperformed and surged almost 20%, rebounding from a 5.8% drop on Monday as upbeat China car sales data offered some support. Since hitting an all-time high on January 26th, the firm has shed a third of its&nbsp;value.</p>
