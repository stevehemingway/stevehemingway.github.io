<h2>It&#8217;s a $<span class="caps">RIOT</span> &#8212; Riot&nbsp;Blockchain</h2>
<p>I am unconvinced about bitcoin.
It&#8217;s a great idea, but as a currency, it just doesn&#8217;t have the liquidity, convenience or cost advantage of existing money-like assets (like USTs or banknotes).
Anyway, I&#8217;m in a minority, and people want to invest in $<span class="caps">BTC</span>, which is fine.
Institutions are being pushed by their customers into doing so, and for this reason Greyscale Bitcoin Trust ($<span class="caps">GBTC</span>) has had a fantastic&nbsp;run.</p>
<p>If you like gold, you probably like gold miners even more. By analogy if you like <span class="caps">BTC</span> you&#8217;ll like $<span class="caps">RIOT</span> even&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>Bitcoin to me seems a bit like Amazon. A lot of people considered the company doomed in the late 90&#8217;s, because it would never make money. Guess what: they were actually 100% right. $<span class="caps">AMZN</span> does not make any profits from its retail operation, although its cloud computing division does mint&nbsp;money.</p>
<p>Maybe we&#8217;re here now with <span class="caps">BTC</span>. It will never work as a currency, but someone will discover something it does do well, and with companies like $<span class="caps">RIOT</span> getting free capital to run the infrastructure, it&#8217;ll eventually be in great&nbsp;demand.</p>
<p>Seriously, I would have dismissed this argument out of hand ten years ago, but now I&#8217;m not so&nbsp;sure.</p>
<h2>Comparisons with March&nbsp;2020</h2>
<p>Oil has been hammered recently. Robin Brooks points out that things can go horribly wrong when oil prices fall&nbsp;dramatically.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">March 2020 global sell-off<br>1. <span class="caps">OPEC</span> fails to cut production<br>2. Oil prices plummet as a result<br>3. That pulls down <span class="caps">EM</span> currencies<br>4. <span class="caps">EM</span> central banks sell <span class="caps">US</span> Treasuries<br>5. That blows up the basis &#8220;carry&#8221; trade<br>6. Fed has to do $1.5 tn in emergency <span class="caps">QE</span><br>7. It all started with oil prices <a href="https://t.co/e2pmcLB3zV">pic.twitter.com/e2pmcLB3zV</a></p>&mdash; Robin Brooks (@RobinBrooksIIF) <a href="https://twitter.com/RobinBrooksIIF/status/1464594888301895680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>Oil prices seem to have pulled back today, and maybe <span class="caps">OPEC</span>+ will quicker to react, but omicron has triggered a fairly violent reaction in commodities.
<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ftse-stock-markets-oil-price-dax-cac-sp-500-omicron-084455028.html">There is definitely evidence that <span class="caps">OPEC</span> is reacting to omicron</a>.
Most populations have a sort of resigned compliance with new lockdown edicts, but I wonder how many Christmases need to be cancelled before voters say &#8220;enough is&nbsp;enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Covid is becoming endemic now.
It seems unlikely we&#8217;ll ever distribute enough vaccines to developing countries to eliminate it.
It will probably out-evolve our ability to make it extinct, but omicron seems to obey the general pattern of parasites evolving so that they are less likely to kill their&nbsp;host.</p>
<h2>China</h2>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><span class="caps">FT</span>. Being rich in China is no funny business:<br><br>&#8220;Among the 72 billionaires, 15 were murdered, 17 committed suicide, seven died from accidents, 14 were executed according to the law and 19 died from&nbsp;diseases.&#8221;</p>&mdash; Daniel Lacalle (@dlacalle_IA) <a href="https://twitter.com/dlacalle_IA/status/1465946235509084160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>Deng changed China, in a way that would have been unimaginable to Mao.
He unleashed the forces of capitalism, but China remains very unlike any western capitalist&nbsp;country.</p>
<p>It is a country that is brutal in its treatment of any dissent within its claimed borders.
<span class="caps">US</span> plutocrats try to pretend that it&#8217;s warm and cuddly, but it&#8217;s simply not.
<a href="https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1465660719756681218?s=20">The idea that it&#8217;s just behaving like a strict parent</a> is laughable.
Dalio&#8217;s nervousness indicates that he doesn&#8217;t believe what he&#8217;s saying either, but cannot afford to tell the&nbsp;truth.</p>
<h2>Tesla &#8212; $<span class="caps">TSLA</span>:<span class="caps">NDQ</span></h2>
<p>I hate writing about this insane stock.
Today I&#8217;ll link to something about SpaceX: private, but supposedly evidence of Elon&#8217;s commercial genius.
Well <a href="https://twitter.com/TMFAssociates/status/1464595216279605256?s=20">it seems like SpaceX is not making money either</a>.</p>

<p>Worth&nbsp;following.</p>
<h2>Triton &#8212; $<span class="caps">TRTN</span>:<span class="caps">NDQ</span></h2>
<p>Unlike most shipping stocks, Triton International has not made much headway this year.
It seems to be growing its <span class="caps">EPS</span> at a steady clip, and always beating estimates.
Its margins are slim, but it has strong and steady revenues.
At P/E of ~9 and a div. yield of 4.5%, and a dividend coming up, it&#8217;s worth a&nbsp;look.</p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>More tightening/tapering talk from JPoww and the first <span class="caps">US</span> omicron variant case identified pushed down the markets.
The 10Y Treasury is down to 1.4189% in yield, but this is still above where it was through most of September.
$<span class="caps">DXY</span> barely moved.
Oil is down because &#8220;the market&#8221; doesn&#8217;t believe that <span class="caps">OPEC</span> will reduce supply. We will&nbsp;see.</p>
