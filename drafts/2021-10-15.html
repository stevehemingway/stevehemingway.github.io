<p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4435982-whitecap-resources-id-like-a-little-oil-with-my-carbon-capture-please">This article</a> makes the bull case for $<span class="caps">WCP</span>:<span class="caps">TOR</span>
It&#8217;s an oil company that&#8217;s carbon negative, because it can store <span class="caps">CO</span>~2~ in so-called carbon-capture underground storage (<span class="caps">CCUS</span>). 
I&#8217;m not sold on <span class="caps">CCUS</span>, but I think all these schemes to reduce <span class="caps">CO</span>~2~ emissions are wildly expensive. 
For $<span class="caps">WCP</span>, it doesn&#8217;t matter, presumably, because the income will come from taxpayers (or, the public, via wheezes like the &#8220;fossil fuel obligation&#8221;).
I have solar panels: they are a crazy way of generating electricity, but as long as I get my feed-in tariff, I&#8217;m&nbsp;happy.</p>
<h2>Expectations and&nbsp;inflation</h2>
<p>Jeremy Rudd doesn&#8217;t think that expectations matter, at least for determining the path of inflation.
<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2021062pap.pdf">His paper for Jackson Hole</a> causes quite a stir when it came out, more for the footnotes than the content, possibly.
But expectations matter a whole lot for equity prices. In particular analysts&#8217; expectations of income numbers, heavily adjusted and massaged although they nearly always are.
The problem is that they&#8217;ve been been way out of line recently. I always thought that these estimates were not really estimates but numbers whispered to the (favoured) analysts by CEOs and CFOs a short time before the print, just to make sure that vested shares could be sold into a rally. Maybe I overestimated the CEOs (or underestimated the analysts), because this big overshoot has been dramatic this&nbsp;time. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Data Trek asks the highly relevant question; how good Q3 <span class="caps">US</span> corporate earnings season have to be to get a large cap stock rally into the end of 2021? Data Trek answer: &#8220;In a typical quarter, companies beat Wall Street’s earnings estimates by 3-4 percent. In Q1 and Q2 2021, however, the beats were much higher: 23 and 17 percentage points above analysts’ estimates, respectively. It is that extraordinary level of operational outperformance that has given us a 17 percent <span class="caps">YTD</span> return on the S&amp;P 500. Our answer: the companies of the S&amp;P 500 need to beat by an aggregate 10 percentage points this quarter, or we’ve almost certainly seen the highs on <span class="caps">US</span> equity markets for the year&#8221;.&nbsp;|</p>
