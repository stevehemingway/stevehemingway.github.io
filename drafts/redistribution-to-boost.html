<p>I have recently read Keynes&#8217; <em>magnum opus</em>, the General Theory. In it he repeatedly mentions the importance of taking action&nbsp;to </p>
<p>I, like Hunt, am not a believer in the Phillips Curve, and I think this would be far better than
trying to find infrastructure projects, or build windmills over the&nbsp;country.</p>
<h2>Macron vs Le Pen: the plutocracy vs the&nbsp;precariat</h2>
<p>I think the best commentary on the French election that I read was by Yanis Varoufakis <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/macron-has-strengthened-french-far-right-by-yanis-varoufakis-2022-04">in <em>Project&nbsp;Syndicate</em></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the precariat expanded. Many voters saw their prospects diminish as a direct consequence of policies which seemed to them to constitute an outright class war waged against them personally: tax giveaways to the already ultra-rich, deregulation of layoffs, a regressive carbon tax, and a determination to raise the pension age significantly in a country where poor men’s life expectancy is 13 years lower than that of well-off men. This reality became the foundation of the mutually reinforcing feedback between Macron’s and Le Pen’s political oeuvre. While there is no whiff of collusion – they are clearly allergic to each other – the dynamic between them forms a political cul-de-sac that facilitates a new type of capital accumulation for a new ruling class. Macron ultimately serves that class, and its reign is strengthened when someone like Le Pen is the official&nbsp;opposition. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The plutocracy controls the mainstream media; social media is controlled by a handful of billionaires. It&#8217;s not surprising that commentary like Varoufakis&#8217;s does not make it to the mass&nbsp;media. </p>
<p>Maybe at some point, some genuine representative of the precariat, or at least a leader of one of the mainstream socialist parties will appear who actually cares about their lot. 
Until then, we&#8217;ll get technocrats or demagogues. 
How&nbsp;sad.</p>
