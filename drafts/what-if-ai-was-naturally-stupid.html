<h1>Wrap</h1>
<p>Generally risk on.  10Y yields starting to rise again. Some very positive stats on the economy emerging recently.<br>
Reflationary trade is on again, <span class="caps">NDX</span> down, <span class="caps">DJI</span> and Russell up. 
Dollar gains.
Commodities generally flat, pinned down by the rise in rates and the dollar. 
Fairly quiet day in the markets.
Ponzi SPACs all still in&nbsp;play.</p>

<h1>The&nbsp;week</h1>
<ul>
<li>inflation: it&#8217;s not here yet, but it&#8217;s increasingly&nbsp;expected,</li>
<li><span class="caps">US</span> yields: rising, and with them dollar vs the&nbsp;RoW,</li>
<li>highly speculative, high beta plays are being picked up by retail investors: Bitcoin, SPACs, housing, fallen angels, known Ponzi&nbsp;stocks,</li>
<li><span class="caps">UK</span> and other countries are seeing how the <span class="caps">US</span> administration to &#8220;go big&#8221; appears to be working, and has defused popular anger at rising inequality, un-affordable housing, loss of personal and economic freedoms (vaccine passports, anyone?) and even identity politics&nbsp;grievances,</li>
<li>huge government programmes ploughing money into &#8220;green jobs&#8221; are universally supported. More economically rational ways to reduce <span class="caps">CO</span>~2~ emissions are forgotten about. Carbon pricing, permits etc. are a thing of the past. Only the <span class="caps">EU</span> persists in large scale carbon trading, but even that is very&nbsp;incomplete,</li>
<li>scientists, often working outside their original field of study, are now driving policy, with economists&nbsp;sidelined,</li>
<li>many senior politicians have stopped even pretending to have gone into the field to serve the&nbsp;public.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sorry to ruin the start of your&nbsp;weekend.</p>
