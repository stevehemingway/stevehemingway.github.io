<h2>Oil&nbsp;forecast</h2>
<p><img alt="34dd9261586a1887747c4622ab75e572.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/34dd9261586a1887747c4622ab75e572.png"></p>
<p>Currently, oil is trending&nbsp;down.</p>
<h2>Commodities&nbsp;fading</h2>
<p><img alt="92e2b64a181cab4f1d6dfa51047983af.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/92e2b64a181cab4f1d6dfa51047983af.png"></p>
<p>Strong move down in commodities. Is this the consensus trade&nbsp;fading?</p>
<h2>Crazy Cathie lives up to her&nbsp;name</h2>
<p><a href="https://ark-funds.com/tag/liquidity">Just listen to her</a>, if you can bear to. Pick up the remarks at around 11m30s.  Insane: she breezily dismisses the risk that having a load of highly illiquid issues in her portfolio by explaining that she can meet redemptions by liquidating the more liquid names (like, presumably, $<span class="caps">TSLA</span>), that will be relatively unscathed by a market selloff. Well, we may find out how this pans&nbsp;out.</p>
<h2><span class="caps">UK</span> version of Sarbanes Oxley likely to be as rubbish as the&nbsp;original</h2>
<p><a href="https://thedig.substack.com/?r=2mq6s&amp;utm_campaign=pub&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=copy">That&#8217;s the verdict of Francine McKenna, who knows about these things</a>, and knowing the how recondite this topic is, and to what extent this is a wedge issue between the 1% and the rest, I think she&#8217;ll be&nbsp;right.</p>
<h2>Cameron, an &#8220;advisor&#8221; to Greensill, lobbied for the govt. to guarantee their&nbsp;loans</h2>
<p><a href="https://digital.olivesoftware.com/Olive/ODN/FTUK/Default.aspx">Well, he would, wouldn&#8217;t he?</a>.
In the comments in the <span class="caps">FT</span> online version, someone made the comment that it&#8217;s just as well he&#8217;s as hopeless as a lobbyist as he was as prime minister (he failed to deliver the support he lobbied&nbsp;for).</p>
<h2>Quad&nbsp;witching</h2>
<p>Expiry of futures, options, all sorts happening today. Also, the <span class="caps">SLR</span> is due to expire at the end of the month, and the dovish blandishments of Tuesday have already been forgotten, judging by equity&nbsp;markets.</p>
<h2>China and <span class="caps">USA</span> not so friendly any&nbsp;longer</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Senior diplomats from America and China held their first meeting since Joe Biden’s election to the White House. The talks, in Alaska, opened icily—served with lashings of fire. Anthony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, accused China of threatening “the rules-based order” and thus “global stability”. His counterpart, Wang Yi, called America a “struggling democracy” that “suppresses other&nbsp;countries”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>from The&nbsp;Economist.</p>
<h2>Elites baffled by popular distrust of experts, who are closely linked to those same&nbsp;elites</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/03/there-s-a-popular-backlash-against-experts-here-s-why-that-matters/">Yep, from the <span class="caps">WEF</span>, i.e. Davos&nbsp;Man</a></p>
<h2>The current <span class="caps">US</span> Monetary system is due to be&nbsp;&#8216;reset&#8217;</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/39c53b9f-f443-4dde-9cdb-07e8999ec783">Longview Economics expresses the view that the current system run by the Fed is existing on borrowed time</a>.  I think Chris Watling is onto something, but I think that the Fed is good for another few years, or even chairmen. The current system, and the bias towards debt deflation, suits the 1% very nicely, and they&#8217;ll do whatever it takes to keep the system&nbsp;functioning. </p>
<h2><span class="caps">UK</span> Government clueless about improving energy performance of <span class="caps">UK</span>&nbsp;homes</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bf38ee30-3aa3-433e-a557-dbef79df4c71">Chris Giles nails it</a>. The article is behind a paywall, so I&#8217;ve extracted the text and shared it <a href="https://termbin.com/6iii">here</a>. The copy will disappear in a few weeks, so if it&#8217;s gone, you&#8217;ll have to pay to get into the <span class="caps">FT</span> website. Basically, Giles points out that heating houses generates as much carbon as surface transport, but the government is doing essentially nothing to reduce these emissions. The reasons are many, but largely to do with the incentives facing&nbsp;ministers.</p>
<h1>Wrap</h1>
<p>Pretty dull day, in the end. Quad witching didn&#8217;t make a difference. Generally slightly inflationary/risk&nbsp;on:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="caps">US</span> equity indexes mixed, <span class="caps">NDX</span> up&nbsp;0.4%,</li>
<li>Commodities recovering, after a rough day&nbsp;yesterday,</li>
<li>most govt. yields&nbsp;up, </li>
<li>best performing equity sector comms, worst real&nbsp;estate,</li>
<li>small cap growth did best (+1.4%), large cap value worst&nbsp;(-0.5%),</li>
<li><span class="caps">BTC</span> up 1.2%,  <span class="caps">EUR</span>.<span class="caps">USD</span> practically&nbsp;flat.</li>
</ul>
<p>Main news was the Fed announcing it will the <span class="caps">SLR</span> (special liquidity ratio) that allows banks to count treasury bill holdings as cash.
The market seems to take a day or so to digest Fed announcements, so I am not sure that the relatively muted response to this is the last word from the&nbsp;market.</p>
<h1>Chart of the&nbsp;day</h1>
<p>The Philadelphia Fed General Diffusion Index is at practically an all-time high. The <span class="caps">US</span> is on the cusp of finally running its economy&nbsp;hot. </p>
