<p>Nearly everything up, a teeny bit. 
Dollar down, similarly. Dollar assets essentially flat.
Independence Day holiday coming up.
The short sellers have made a packet on Wirecard, but are probably not rushing back to short anything else.
$<span class="caps">TSLA</span> makes headlines by overtaking Toyota in terms of market cap, if not enterprise value (Toyota has more debt financing). 
Nobody can explain why $<span class="caps">TSLA</span> can be worth so much, but nobody is going to risk their capital by shorting it.
I guess that&#8217;s all the explanation you need. 
More detail in: 
<a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/01/double-wtf-chart-of-the-year-tesla-becomes-most-valuable-automaker-blows-by-toyota/">Double-<span class="caps">WTF</span> Chart of the Year Update: Tesla Becomes Most Valuable Automaker, Blows by Toyota </a> by Wolf.
Its hard to believe there are any bears left to squeeze.
My understanding is that at this point the stock will start trading at some kind of rational valuation.
It&#8217;d be exceedingly dangerous to put money on&nbsp;that!</p>
<p>I created a Google alert to look out for news items mentioning shorts by well known asset managers.
Unfortunately, by the time you read that (e.g.) Crispin Odey is shorting Stock $X, you sort of know he&#8217;s just written the press release to make it cheaper for him to cover. 
Not that I&#8217;m cynical like that, or&nbsp;anything.</p>
<p>This is definitely the time to be delta (equity) neutral, and probably pretty much theta neutral too. 
So you might as well go to the&nbsp;beach!</p>
<h2>Afternoon</h2>
<p>Jobs number and Presidential press conference gave an adrenaline shot to the stockmarket (although it left bonds unimpressed). 
$<span class="caps">TSLA</span> jumped some insane amount, on the usual&nbsp;hopium.</p>
<p>Ghislaine Maxwell got arrested! Hope her life insurance premiums are up to&nbsp;date.</p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>I discovered <a href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=7106">Interactive Brokers Options Strategy Lab</a>. 
What a wonderful piece of software!
I&#8217;ve been selling a bit of vol for a while,
but this is such a neat way of crafting a &#8216;combination&#8217;.
I&#8217;ll probably write some more when I&#8217;ve had more chance to do experiments in the&nbsp;lab.</p>
<p>The markets are stubbornly up on employment being down only 26% since the start of the year.
I can&#8217;t imagine the highs we&#8217;d get if it were down only&nbsp;20%.</p>
