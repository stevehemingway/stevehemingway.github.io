This is where my blog is hosted. To see the source, look at the 'content' branch.

## Pelican

My blog is just some static HTML, generated from some markdown documents. I use 
[pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) to generate the HTML. 
Markdown is a nice compromise between expressivity and complexity.
It's easier to create than using MS Word, but it's a bit more expressive than plain text.
Anyone who has used github or bitbucket will already know markdown. 
It's basically just the old-fashioned formatting one used to use for emails before HTML email bodies were a thing.
It means that I can write an entry in vi. Yes, _vi_, that olde worlde unix editor (which now also runs on everything, including your IoT webcam).

## Git

What can I say about git? It's a pig to learn, but it runs on everything and allows collaboration.
Well, the latter is slightly academic for me, although it does open up the possibility of someone else
creating content here. 
To be honest, I was attracted to github pages because of the ability to upload via git and keep the working files on different PCs (my desktop and my laptop(s)).
I am not a git guru. I'm barely passed the novice stage. Again, git works because every possible question it is possible to ask about how it works has been answered already on 
[stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). 

## Github pages

Github offers web hosting. Cool, eh? Free, as well. What's not to like? You can even use your own domain name.
