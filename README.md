This is my blog.

It's written in markdown, and converted to a static site using [Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/).

I've tweaked a few things over the years, and have got it in a nice state now. 
I can write my blog anywhere where I can use git, and I can generate the site easily as long as I have python.
I usually use Windows, but I was using this on Fedora linux. The software is pretty much platform independent.

I am currently using github pages to host because it's free, and doesn't insert advertising, and is quick and is likely to be Google-friendly.
I could host it anywhere though: it's just static HTML, generated locally.

Uploading to the server is done using git. I am not a git expert, and the idea of having one branch for the source and one branch for the generated
content was a bit new to me. Everything works via a makefile, _nearly_. A few manual git commands are needed to keep things in check.
For a git expert, these would probably be second nature.
