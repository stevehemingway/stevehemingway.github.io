<p>Markets ground higher. Dunno why, that&#8217;s just what they do. 
The writing expensive calls strategy seems to be working. 
Got nervous and put more trailing stops in place. 
I collected <a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5ee9e268769b5613837afb5c">a list of gold and silver miners</a>.
They probably are worth looking into a bit. Some are very small, so one would be mad to have more than a tiny flutter on those. 
There is some evidence that an old drug helps those who are on ventilators as a result of catching Covid-19. 
A slender pillar to support a&nbsp;rally.</p>
<h2>Today</h2>
<p>Some news of the <span class="caps">UK</span> govt. cutting some spending on pensions.
Powell gave some testimony to the Congress banking committee, didn&#8217;t say very much of note (as far as I can tell).
Stocks grind higher.
The appearance before the Senate banking panel seems not to have yet caused any excitement.
From the odd fevered comment on Twitter he&#8217;s doubling down. 
I saw something about him saying that he did not see any shrinking of the balance sheet,
which is scarcely&nbsp;controversial. </p>
<h2>Interesting&nbsp;reads</h2>
<p><a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/06/01/rents-in-the-most-expensive-cities-drop-oil-patch-gets-hit-too-but-massive-gains-in-other-cities/">This article on apartment rent levels in the <span class="caps">USA</span></a> came out a while ago. Wolf Richer produces some amazing research. 
I&#8217;m not really interested in the <span class="caps">US</span> rental market, but it might shed some light on the <span class="caps">UK</span> one,
which I am interested&nbsp;in.</p>
