<h1>14 Oct&nbsp;2021</h1>
<h2>Market cycle&nbsp;psychology</h2>
<p>I used to subscribe to Bill Fleckenstein&#8217;s daily post. 
It was interesting, but Bill suffers from being a perpetual bear, waiting for the Japan panic of 1992 to occur again in equity markets.
To be fair, Bill says that you can&#8217;t prosper as a bear in a bull market, and we&#8217;ve had a bull market in everything since 1981 when Volker persuaded us that the Fed could save the&nbsp;world.</p>
<p>Jamie Dimon said again the other day that he believes that bitcoin is worthless. 
He also said that he wasn&#8217;t going to pass up the chance of making a profit by selling it to clients of <span class="caps">JPM</span>, which you might think was a tad cynical if you had never heard of Jamie&nbsp;before. </p>
<p>Bitcoin trades in a choppy directionless way, or at least has done for the last six months, as this chart from Trading View&nbsp;shows:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/8VBejiH5/" width=750></p>
<p>For me, Bitcoin is the ultimate indicator of sentiment: a worthless asset with good price discovery, the price of which is (<em>I think</em>) hard to manipulate in a coordinated&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>Downloads of Robinhood, the app, have cratered. Chamath and Cathie are yesterday&#8217;s men (and women). Investors have learned that SPACs are the road to riches, but only for the sponsors. Central banks around the world have started tightening. Labour has started to flex its muscles, relative to capital. Maybe this is a point of inflection. Maybe this is just my fevered imagination and bias confirmation surfacing again. Time will&nbsp;tell.</p>
<h2>Dorel&nbsp;Industries</h2>
<p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4459604-dorel-industries-stock-sports-business-sale">This post</a> gives an overview of Dorel Industries. It&#8217;s a boring company in a boring segment that survived a private equity bid earlier this year.
I don&#8217;t know much about it, but it seems to have a plan to sell of its bicycle selling business and use the cash to reduce leverage.
It seems to have a significant level of family ownership (with A and B shares, presumably giving the family more&nbsp;control).</p>
<p>It has had a bit of visibility lately, which is probably good for the stock price. 
It&#8217;s hard to say if it truly is a buy, but I&#8217;d certainly prefer it to $<span class="caps">ARKK</span>. 
Maybe a pair strategy would work, but it&#8217;d be hard to execute. 
Your call. I don&#8217;t own any, but I am tempted to buy a few&nbsp;shares.</p>

<h2>1987 all over&nbsp;again?</h2>
<p>I was working for the <span class="caps">UK</span> Stock Exchange in October 1987. 
On the working day before the 1987 crash, the systems went down, because there had been very high winds, which had wreaked havoc with the telephone system (remember when this was important?). &#8220;Telegraphic Transfers&#8221; (as they were still called, although I think that Telex had replaced telegrams) failed, causing house sales to fail to settle (or &#8220;complete&#8221; in the jargon). 
The weird thing is that nobody seems very clear what caused the crash, or why the real economy wasn&#8217;t really impacted at all. 
<a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-culprits-of-the-1987-market-crash-remain-a-mystery-what-lessons-can-we-draw-from-it-now-51634112900">This article</a> is about what we can learn from Black Monday of 1987, which as I have said, isn&#8217;t very much.
The favoured explanation of the time was that &#8220;portfolio insurance&#8221; was to blame. 
This seemed to be accepted, but in retrospect, this seems very unlikely. It&#8217;s not as though investors do not hedge themselves against a crash, and it&#8217;s not as though gamma squeezes never happen.
I think what we can learn is that market crashes can come out of the&nbsp;blue.</p>

<h2>1973 all over&nbsp;again?</h2>
<p>There are stories of strikes hitting the news again. John Deere is the latest employer to be hit. 
There are stories of shortages of fuel and … well everything, but today zinc and over the last few months oil and gas.
There is a flattening yield curve, as central banks move to tighten at the short end of the curve.
Mini skirts and flared trousers are suddenly back in fashion. Well, I made that last one up, but it could&nbsp;happen!</p>
<h2><span class="caps">SOS</span> Starship&nbsp;Enterprise!</h2>
<p>From <a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/thats-what-this-starship-is-all-about/">Alex Manzara&#8217;s post today</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Obviously, the CBs are not being particularly vigilant, inflation expectations seem to be coming unmoored, and the market is close to taking matters into its own hands.  The Fed appears to be boxed in.  Crude oil this morning near a new high with <span class="caps">CLX1</span> trading up 95 cents at 81.39.  China’s Factory gate inflation “rose to a record on soaring commodity prices, but weak demand capped consumer inflation…” (<span class="caps">RTRS</span>).  China <span class="caps">PPI</span> was +10.7%.  <span class="caps">US</span> <span class="caps">PPI</span> on tap for today expected +8.7% with Core&nbsp;+7.1%.</p>
