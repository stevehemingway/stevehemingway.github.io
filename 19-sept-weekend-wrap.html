</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h1><span class="caps">RBG</span></h1>
<p>Ruth Bader Ginsberg died this week. She was 87.
The liberals in the <span class="caps">US</span> are outraged that Trump may get to choose her replacement. 
I don&#8217;t know why she didn&#8217;t she didn&#8217;t step down while Obama could have chosen a 40-year old to replace her.
I guess I&#8217;ll never understand <span class="caps">US</span>&nbsp;politics.</p>
<h1>$<span class="caps">NKLA</span></h1>
<p>The mainstream media seem to be waking up to the fact that Nikola is a fraud, after @nikloatrevor admitted that a video of their prototype had no engine but was just rolling down a hill like a physics experiment involving a frictionless block on an inclined plane.
The <span class="caps">TESLAQ</span>  crowd have known that $<span class="caps">NKLA</span> was a fraud stock for years, but nobody ever paid attention to them.
$<span class="caps">NKLA</span> worth more than $F&nbsp;(Ford).</p>
<h1>Tik&nbsp;Tok</h1>
<p>There is a huge fuss over who will pick up the carcass of this short video app. Trump probably spends more time on it than on bringing peace to the Middle East (on the other hand, maybe that&#8217;s an already solved problem).
I installed the app and understand that it delivers a quick thrill to the users, and can be a cheap way for &#8216;models&#8217; to promote their Only Fans pages, but really, does it have any meaningful competitive edge over (e.g.) Facebook bringing out a clone&nbsp;app?</p>
<h1>The&nbsp;Week</h1>
<p>Europe sectors for the week: winners were retail, health and mining. Losers were banks, autos and oil and&nbsp;gas.</p>
<p><span class="caps">US</span> sectors for the week: winners were  energy, industrials, materials and health care; losers were the rest, especially consumer discretionary and communications services. Oddly, real estate was about flat.
Energy has had an <em>annus horribilis</em>: the <span class="caps">GSCI</span> Energy Index is down&nbsp;55%.</p>
<h1><span class="caps">UK</span> Rental&nbsp;Demand</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/sep/20/private-rents-plunge-covid-19-decimates-lettings-market-workplace-space-gardens">Looks weak</a>.
This has to be pretty negative for Lloyds and&nbsp;Natwest.</p>
<h1>Is <span class="caps">AUD</span> the new <span class="caps">CHF</span>?</h1>
<p>Monetary easing is probably going to continue, which logically is negative for the dollar.
But all the other countries are easing like maniacs too.
My bet is that <span class="caps">AUD</span> is a better bet than <span class="caps">CHF</span>. It has gold, not in vaults, but in yet to be exploited gold reserves.
It has a much lower debt than most countries, and it is a fully functioning democracy which doesn&#8217;t spend huge sums on defence.
It even has a relatively young population.
I&#8217;m guessing about the factors, so do your own&nbsp;research.</p>
<h1>Commodities and&nbsp;inflation</h1>
<p>I think commodities are cheap relative to <span class="caps">GBP</span>. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-09-15/fed-wants-inflation-japan-points-to-easy-money-limits?sref=uN6cur8D">So does John Authers</a>. 
I&#8217;m a bit worried about this: whenever Authers says something I agree with, the market takes the opposing view.
It is particularly interesting to see <span class="caps">UK</span> inflation looking as though it&#8217;s about to take off.
The traditional method of profiting from this would be to sell gilts, but maybe buying a commodity index (future) and selling <span class="caps">GBP</span>.<span class="caps">USD</span> to hedge the dollar exposure would be more reliable given that the Bank of England is likely to be rigging the gilts market for some decades to&nbsp;come.</p>

<p>Long gold, short <span class="caps">TRY</span> sounds a good bet&nbsp;too.</p>
