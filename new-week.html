</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h1>Market&nbsp;Open</h1>
<p>Nothing much happens on a Monday morning, normally. Today saw some movement in commodities, mainly, with other assets largely quiet. Precious metals were up (except Platinum), agricultural commodities too, and <span class="caps">NG</span>. Oil was down.
The <span class="caps">FT</span> had a chart for this year so far showing oil price (pretty flat) vs the <span class="caps">US</span> energy sector ($<span class="caps">XLE</span>).</p>
<h1>Stock markets even less representative of the real economy than in the&nbsp;past</h1>
<p>Hardly a surprise, as I am sure I&#8217;ve noted before, but <a href="https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1315611971090296832">endorsed by Paul Krugman</a>. Unsurprisingly, with the economy now dominated by services, which generally don&#8217;t require a lot of capital investment, the capital markets (including the equity market) is less necessary.
It&#8217;s been a long time since firms raised money to invest in physical capital on the stock market.
<span class="caps">IPO</span>&#8217;s are much more likely to be about allowing early investors (<span class="caps">VC</span>) to cash out (and, in the view of some, hand the paper to the&nbsp;bagholders).</p>
<h1>Wrap</h1>
<p>Somehow commodities are all weak today. This note made at 2:<span class="caps">33GMT</span>. Maybe things will reverse later. 
Canada is shut, and it&#8217;s Columbus Day in the <span class="caps">US</span>, so markets may not be operating normally.
Equity markets seem reasonably bouncy, so this should be risk on.
Bonds, as usual, are not really giving any indication of&nbsp;risk.</p>
<p>The big move today was driven by a rapid drop in the oil price. 
A lot of production seems to be coming online. 
I think Libya production has restarted. 
Nobody on Twitter can work out what is happening. It looks increasingly as though Biden will win the election, and suddenly this is as positive for stocks as Trump winning the&nbsp;election. </p>
<h1>Stock to look&nbsp;at</h1>
<p>$<span class="caps">TEV</span>.<span class="caps">CA</span> was down a huge amount today (&gt;10%). I saw some tweets to say that this has very postive free cashflow and a large part of the free float held by insiders, which would create the possibility of a short squeeze.
I know precisely nothing about this stock, so <em>do your research</em>!</p>
<p>A lot of <span class="caps">FANG</span> stocks were up a huge amount today: $<span class="caps">AAPL</span> over 6%. 
Most energy stocks were&nbsp;hammered.</p>
