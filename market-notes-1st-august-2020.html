<h2>My&nbsp;thoughts</h2>
<p>Turkey seems to be heading in the direction of hyperinflation. 
A country on the borders of Europe being in such a terrible place is not going to play out well.
The <span class="caps">EU</span> has paid Turkey to keep a lot of refugees within its borders, to save us giving them asylum,
I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s going to be sustainable.
In&nbsp;real </p>
