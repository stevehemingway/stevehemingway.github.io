<h2>Expectations</h2>
<p>The market really doesn&#8217;t see inflation yet.&nbsp;This </p>
<iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=OAzu&width=670&height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden; width:670px; height:525px;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"></iframe>

<h2>Agricultural&nbsp;products</h2>
<p>Oil is yesterday&#8217;s fuel. Nobody wants to use it, and nobody wants to be in the business of drilling for it.
Everyone wants to drive around in a solar-powered car. 
But this is not easy or cheap to do, so a second-best solution is to use oil, but to make it &#8216;renewable,&#8217; i.e. from 
plant materials.
The problem is that the plant materials you might use a corn and soya, which happen to be important foodstuffs, 
the demand for which is not likely to drop as the world becomes more populous and richer.
Given that the cost of inputs to producing plants like soya and corn are going up&nbsp;rapidly.</p>
<p>I always felt that corn was the commodity to buy, but I have read a piece by Doomberg which makes the case that soybeans 
might be a better bet.
His point is that diesel is in very short supply, and the only renewable option for replacing its use is &#8220;the beans.&#8221;
He makes the case forcefully, <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/diesel-for-dinner?r=nmbt&amp;s=r&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">here</a>.
Of course, it may already be too late. 
In case you somehow missed it, this is not advice, and you should assume that those trading the commodity are better informed than you are and that its current price fully incorporates all information about the likely course of present and future supply and demand&nbsp;evolution.</p>
<h2>Elon and&nbsp;China</h2>
<p><a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/elon-musk-china-and-the-biden-collapse?r=nmbt&amp;s=r&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">This</a> is the best piece I&#8217;ve read on the extent to which Elon Musk is beholden to the Chinese Communist&nbsp;Party.</p>
