<h2>title: Day of Remembrance (Veterans Day)
category: markets
date: 11 november 2020&nbsp;tags:</h2>
<h1>It&#8217;s a holiday in the <span class="caps">US</span></h1>
<p>Some markets are closed.
It&#8217;s best not to trade on such a day.
The tone seems to be moderately risk-on, but we&#8217;ll have to wait until tomorrow for something definite.
The only notable thing that&#8217;s come onto my radar is the spike up in the Turkish Lira.
It seems likely to reverse, but central banks talk to one another and can squeeze a bear market ruthlessly if the decide that they want to.
Emerging markets are generally having a great time because everyone is convinced that an effective vaccine is around the&nbsp;corner.</p>
<p>Today appears to be a retrace.
Gold is still weak, but the growth stocks are now going up again.
There is some cynicism about the vaccine, not least because the <span class="caps">CEO</span> of Pfizer unloaded a large chunk of his stock a very short time after the announcement, and more or less at the point of maximum profit.
I guess the actual announcement was not inside information, but if there any reasons that the trial might be suspect which are known to him these, surely, would&nbsp;be.</p>
<h1>Wrap</h1>
<p>Basically a huge rotation back into the &#8220;defensive&#8221; <span class="caps">FAANG</span> mega-caps with a collapse in value stocks generally.
Most global equity markets up, not much action in currencies.
Treasuries shut for Veterans&#8217; Day.
Commodities were mixed, with most food down (except live cattle),
Most energy commodities up, with a couple of fractions down,
gold approx.&nbsp;flat.</p>
<h1>Economics&nbsp;focus</h1>
<p>Leaving aside the normal caveats about interpreting unemployment rates, it seems quite clear that the <span class="caps">US</span> has a much more flexible labour market than the <span class="caps">UK</span>.
This is going to cause some pain in the <span class="caps">UK</span> in the months and years&nbsp;ahead.</p>
