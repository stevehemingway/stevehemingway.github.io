<h2><span class="caps">GBP</span>.<span class="caps">USD</span></h2>
<p>The pound has been cratering lately.
The current account is terrible (?<span class="caps">GBP</span> 110 B, ~ 5% of <span class="caps">GDP</span>), the budget deficit is worse (14% of <span class="caps">GDP</span>). The <span class="caps">UK</span> is not the <span class="caps">US</span>: it&#8217;s currency is not a reserve currency, it doesn&#8217;t export any oil, or have significant reserves relative to its own consumption.
It looks pretty weak. These things haven&#8217;t mattered for a while, but things can often be ignored by the markets until they&nbsp;aren&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The added complication is that both the Bank of England and the Treasury seem hell bent on making things worse. The Bank is reluctant to keep buying gilts, the Treasury is looking at tightening fiscal policy, because … &#8220;sound&nbsp;money&#8221;.</p>
<p>The economy has a terrible supply problem at the moment, which has caused inflation to spike, which has no doubt spurred the Bank into action, but it&#8217;s likely that the general hangover from post-pandemic spending, plus the Treasury cutting spending and increasing taxes (some already announced, like increased taxes on dividends and increases in National Insurance (a payroll tax by any other name) is going to tip the country over the edge, in my&nbsp;view.</p>
<p>There are lots of factors affecting exchange rates, and a monetary tightening might be expected to strengthen <span class="caps">GBP</span>, but only if it is greater than in the <span class="caps">US</span> (for the rates against <span class="caps">USD</span>). This doesn&#8217;t much matter in the short run, anyway.
The main problem is that safe assets, for the whole planet, are denominated in <span class="caps">USD</span>, so demand for this currency will be strong, which will exacerbate the&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>Having said all that, I acknowledge that forecasting currency movements is a mug&#8217;s game, you would probably best avoiding any kind of speculation on this currency pair; not that this should be taken as advice of any&nbsp;sort.</p>
<p>I took Brent Donnelly&#8217;s Spectra Market&#8217;s daily newsletter as a starting point for this&nbsp;rant. </p>
<h2><span class="caps">IBM</span></h2>
<p>Josh Young has written a piece on Seeking Alpha arguing that <span class="caps">IBM</span> will never be able to make the sorts of investments that might allow it to challenge the <span class="caps">FAANG</span>.
The argument is that it&#8217;s commitment to dividends is depleting its free cash flow so much that it will eventually run out of&nbsp;money.</p>
<p>Read the full thesis <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4457656-ibm-is-a-melting-ice-cube">here</a>. </p>
<h2>Let them heat their homes with carbon&nbsp;offsets</h2>
<p><a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2021/09/29/will-esg-create-the-next-lehman-moment/">Kuppy tells it like it is.</a>
He is all in on fossil fuels.
The thesis is strong, but the world&#8217;s massed central bankers may be stronger.
It&#8217;s an interesting battle to watch. There will be collateral&nbsp;damage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ever since I can remember, billionaires have been taking private jets to conclaves where they strategized on how to reduce other people’s carbon emissions. At the time, I thought little of it—billionaires need hobbies and all. Besides, true billionaire credentials are gained when a squadron of luxury jets arrives to lecture some impoverished country on why they don’t deserve electricity. It is as cringeworthy as Marie Antoinette advising starving Parisians to eat cake since they couldn’t afford bread. Then again, part of being a billionaire is proving how tone-deaf you can be, while getting away with it. Boys will be&nbsp;boys…</p>
