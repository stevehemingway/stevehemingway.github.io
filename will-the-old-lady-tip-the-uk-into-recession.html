<h2><span class="caps">GBP</span>.<span class="caps">USD</span></h2>
<p>The pound has been cratering lately.
The current account is terrible (?<span class="caps">GBP</span> 110 B, ~ 5% of <span class="caps">GDP</span>), the budget deficit is worse (14% of <span class="caps">GDP</span>). The <span class="caps">UK</span> is not the <span class="caps">US</span>: it&#8217;s currency is not a reserve currency, it doesn&#8217;t export any oil, or have significant reserves relative to its own consumption.
It looks pretty weak. These things haven&#8217;t mattered for a while, but things can often be ignored by the markets until they&nbsp;aren&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The added complication is that both the Bank of England and the Treasury seem hell bent on making things worse. The Bank is reluctant to keep buying gilts, the Treasury is looking at tightening fiscal policy, because … &#8220;sound&nbsp;money&#8221;.</p>
<p>The economy has a terrible supply problem at the moment, which has caused inflation to spike, which has no doubt spurred the Bank into action, but it&#8217;s likely that the general hangover from post-pandemic spending, plus the Treasury cutting spending and increasing taxes (some already announced, like increased taxes on dividends and increases in National Insurance (a payroll tax by any other name) is going to tip the country over the edge, in my&nbsp;view.</p>
<p>There are lots of factors affecting exchange rates, and a monetary tightening might be expected to strengthen <span class="caps">GBP</span>, but only if it is greater than in the <span class="caps">US</span> (for the rates against <span class="caps">USD</span>). This doesn&#8217;t much matter in the short run, anyway.
The main problem is that safe assets, for the whole planet, are denominated in <span class="caps">USD</span>, so demand for this currency will be strong, which will exacerbate the&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>Having said all that, I acknowledge that forecasting currency movements is a mug&#8217;s game, you would probably best avoiding any kind of speculation on this currency pair; not that this should be taken as advice of any&nbsp;sort.</p>
<p>I took Brent Donnelly&#8217;s Spectra Market&#8217;s daily newsletter as a starting point for this&nbsp;rant. </p>
<h2><span class="caps">IBM</span></h2>
<p>Josh Young has written a piece on Seeking Alpha arguing that <span class="caps">IBM</span> will never be able to make the sorts of investments that might allow it to challenge the <span class="caps">FAANG</span>.
The argument is that it&#8217;s commitment to dividends is depleting its free cash flow so much that it will eventually run out of&nbsp;money.</p>
<p>Read the full thesis <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4457656-ibm-is-a-melting-ice-cube">here</a>. </p>
<h2>Let them heat their homes with carbon&nbsp;offsets</h2>
<p><a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2021/09/29/will-esg-create-the-next-lehman-moment/">Kuppy tells it like it is.</a>
He is all in on fossil fuels.
The thesis is strong, but the world&#8217;s massed central bankers may be stronger.
It&#8217;s an interesting battle to watch. There will be collateral&nbsp;damage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ever since I can remember, billionaires have been taking private jets to conclaves where they strategized on how to reduce other people’s carbon emissions. At the time, I thought little of it—billionaires need hobbies and all. Besides, true billionaire credentials are gained when a squadron of luxury jets arrives to lecture some impoverished country on why they don’t deserve electricity. It is as cringeworthy as Marie Antoinette advising starving Parisians to eat cake since they couldn’t afford bread. Then again, part of being a billionaire is proving how tone-deaf you can be, while getting away with it. Boys will be&nbsp;boys…</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Tether goes full&nbsp;Ponzi&#8221;</h2>
<p><a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/tether-goes-full-ponzi">This</a> is a <em>great</em> read. It reminds us that Tether is a Ponzi, but, well, nobody wants to sell while they are making good money out of it. 
The story of the original Ponzi is fascinating, and is summarized in the article.
The guy just looked the part too:
<img alt="Wouldn't you want this guy to invest your savings for you?" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d4fd017-a525-47b3-963d-112011ecb89a_546x705.jpeg"></p>
<p>Anyway, Doomberg is worth a follow, so&nbsp;enjoy!</p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>Today is the quarter-end. To add to the usual noise, there will be some realizing of profits and crystallizing of losses.
The brinkmanship over the debt ceiling is going on: it seems inconceivable to me that it&#8217;s anything more than certain representatives holding out so they can sell their vote for the highest possible price. The <span class="caps">US</span> economy is not going to collapse because a bunch of politicians are playing hard to get, over a act of political theatre which is not even a feature of any other democracy. Supposedly, Congress will pass a bill to delay the day of reckoning until 3&nbsp;Dec.</p>
<p>Commodities ground higher, in spite of the dollar remaining at elevated levels (<span class="caps">DXY</span>=94.2, down 13bp from yesterday though). Energy commodities of all stripes were up. Russian energy stocks, like $<span class="caps">SNGS</span>, $<span class="caps">ROSN</span>, $<span class="caps">GAZP</span> have had a stunning run. $<span class="caps">LKOH</span> was down 1%. If the dollar strengthens, emerging market oil stocks should have a double-strength tailwind, as long as they are bought on the local exchange. <em>Not investment&nbsp;advice.</em></p>
<p>Emerging markets were under strain: <span class="caps">USD</span>.<span class="caps">MXY</span> was up 57bp.
Bonds were down, but only 1.2bp on the 10Y&nbsp;yield.</p>
<p><span class="caps">NDX</span> was up, 29bp, the other <span class="caps">US</span> indices down. No great vote of confidence from the bulls, but presumably the <span class="caps">FAANG</span> continue to be seen as safe haven stocks, in spite of&nbsp;valuation.</p>
<p>$<span class="caps">APRN</span>, Blue Apron bounced, up 15%, after being beaten down for a long&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>$<span class="caps">THG</span>:<span class="caps">LSE</span> is looking very, very sick. To me it looks like a pyramid scheme, but do your own research because I sure haven&#8217;t done&nbsp;mine.</p>
