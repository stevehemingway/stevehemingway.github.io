<h2>What does Larry want companies to&nbsp;do?</h2>
<p>I am a huge fan of Matt Levine.
His analysis is top class.
He is great at questioning everyone and everything.
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-18/blackrock-still-likes-capitalism">Today</a> he looks
at what the point of Larry Fink&#8217;s letter to CEOs is.
In some sense, it&#8217;s a defence of the Friedmanite position that a <span class="caps">CEO</span> should focus on maximizing returns to shareholders, 
and let those shareholders decide on what non-financial objectives they wish to pursue.
It&#8217;s impossible to summarize: I recommend that you just read it.
His newsletter is free, except for the opportunity cost of having to read it every&nbsp;day.</p>
<h2>Dash for (losing)&nbsp;cash</h2>
<p>I have never used a food delivery app. (Boomer here!) 
I have ordered plenty of takeaways in my time, of which I&#8217;ve collected on 99.5% of occasions.
The odd time I&#8217;ve had food delivered, it has taken ages, and it has been cold and unappetizing by the time it reached me.
Nowadays I&#8217;m good enough at basic cooking that I can rustle up something edible in less time than it would take me to order and collect a&nbsp;takeaway.</p>
<p>So, all the apps make no sense to me. But they are highly priced by the market, since they have shown frenzied growth over the lockdown,
and sales and sales growth are the only metrics that matter to today&#8217;s investors.
But the tide is turning, and investors are becoming sceptical.
<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4480216-doordash-pandemic-peak-will-come-down-to-earth">This hatchet job on Door Dash is worth a look</a>.
The author points out the quite severe headwinds facing $<span class="caps">DASH</span>, and the venal behaviour of its <span class="caps">CEO</span>.
It&#8217;s on my long-list, but it looks as though the shareprice plunge that is taking place now might spell the end.
Of course, Apple might come up with a bid for it at a premium of four times the market price, so be careful out there!
Seriously, the sector looks ripe for consolidation, which will create dangerous obstacles for any short&nbsp;sellers.</p>
<h2><span class="caps">UK</span>&nbsp;Inflation</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s looking&nbsp;bad.</p>
