<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>Generally, equities were up, modestly, bonds were flat (10Y yield precisely so, safely back under 3%), <span class="caps">FX</span> pretty quiet, <span class="caps">DXY</span> falling back from 103.
Most big stocks seem to be up, including Tesla, <span class="caps">XOM</span> and <span class="caps">JPM</span>. </p>
<p>The bond bulls, such as @macroalf, and Andreas Steno-Larsen, think that the Fed has overreached itself, and that it will have to backpedal by the end of the year. I sort of agree that things might start to break (like the housing market), which traditionally spooks the Fed, and that JPoww is no Volker, 
but I think there is simply too much volatility to get&nbsp;involved.</p>
<p>There were some Twitter rumours of the Fed hiking by 75bp tomorrow, but from what I can tell, the market&#8217;s not buying that&nbsp;rumour.</p>
<p>There are an increasing number of sceptics who think that Musk&#8217;s <span class="caps">NGMI</span> (&#8216;not going to make it&#8217;) in his bid for Twitter. He will fail, eventually, but 
Morgan Stanley will want to get those juicy&nbsp;fees.</p>
<p>Weirdly, the Russian ruble is back where it started, before the war with Ukraine. Not sure it&#8217;s not being manipulated, but it&#8217;s&nbsp;interesting.</p>

<p>I understand what a doctor does. I am not entirely sure what &#8220;having a career in public health&#8221; involves, but if this young woman can get elected, more power to her. She has to be a lot more representative of the electorate than most of&nbsp;Congress.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t really know what was behind this, but it feels like there is no depth to these markets.
Longer-dated oil derivatives, which were perfectly liquid six months ago never trade, and get marked to fantasy.
There is a lot of bad news, and a lot of smaller stocks have been hammered, but the mega cap names have remained relatively unscathed.
People talk about the pandemic as though it was a war.
Maybe it was in some respects, but one that left all physical infrastructure untouched.
Maybe soaring oil prices, and container backlogs have spiked prices, but this is not really inflation. 
Credit isn&#8217;t flowing into the real, private economy, because there are no capital projects which 
can give clear the hurdle rate.
Money just sits in <span class="caps">USD</span> collateral, like 3M T-bills, reverse repos and the&nbsp;like.</p>
