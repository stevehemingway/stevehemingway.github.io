<p>Well, it&#8217;s a new day, a new quarter and a new half year. 
Fairly incredibly, the <span class="caps">SPX</span> had the best quarter performance since 1998. 
Well, we know what happened in 2000.
Asian equities up, European ones down.
Odd, given that the police in Hong Kong are arresting people under the new security law, 
and using water cannon on protesters.
Dollar is flat, (nearly) all commodities up (including gold). 
Bonds all seem to be down (i.e. yields up).
Andrew Bailey, BoE Governor, says that inflation may be coming.
John Plender says <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2c4655ac-e740-495b-a3cf-6df278f129b9">the same thing, but more elegantly</a>.
One third of advertisers say they won&#8217;t advertise on social media.
This is a budget cut disguised as a signal of virtue (the problem is that <span class="caps">FB</span> refused to take on the role of deciding which of Donald Trumps statements/tweets they would allow voters to&nbsp;see).</p>
<h2>Updates</h2>
<p>H/T to Credit Bubble&nbsp;Bulletin:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-economy-deficit/brazils-debt-and-deficit-hit-record-highs-in-may-outlook-darkens-idUSKBN24124U">Brazil&#8217;s economy in tatters</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-30/quarterly-hedge-fund-liquidations-surge-to-highest-since-2015?srnd=markets-vp&amp;sref=eo0IIyEe">Hedge funds looking sick</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>House&nbsp;Prices</h2>
<p><a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/06/30/there-sures-a-lot-of-brain-dead-misreporting-about-the-case-shiller-home-price-index-this-morning/"><span class="caps">WR</span></a> has another great article, this time on house prices.
He kind of points out the obvious: that nobody has a clue what will happen to them.
He couches this specifically in respect of reporting of the latest Case-Shiller figures, 
but all news everywhere will suffer from the same problem.
My guess is that house prices are going to take quite a dive.
Interest rates for high-grade borrowers are probably as low as they can go,
without the banks losing money on every mortgage,
so finance is going to dry up,
even though the banks have been pumped full of stimulus.
You can force banks to build up their reserves but nothing in the world can make them lend them,
no matter how much money creation the BoE does.
Wolf has <a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/01/waiting-for-pent-up-demand-uk-house-prices-in-june-fall-for-first-time-since-2012-mortgage-approvals-slump-to-record-low-despite-partial-reopening/">written a parallel piece on the <span class="caps">UK</span> housing market</a>.
Mortgage approvals have fallen by a factor of seven. If that doesn&#8217;t flush out some desperate sellers, I don&#8217;t know what will. I would not like to be an estate agent in this climate, but <span class="caps">EA</span>&#8217;s have a remarkable ability to survive a fee drought. Sadly, no options traded on Foxtons, (<span class="caps">AFAIK</span>) the only listed <span class="caps">UK</span> <span class="caps">EA</span>.</p>
<h2>Trading</h2>
<p>Trading&nbsp;ideas: </p>
<ul>
<li>short bonds (pity there are no gilt futures&nbsp;options),</li>
<li>short $<span class="caps">FB</span>,</li>
<li>short $<span class="caps">HSI</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, this is not investment advice, and now is almost certainly not the right time.
As Trader Vic says, execute only when the technicals agree with the fundamentals.
Don&#8217;t ask me about&nbsp;technicals.</p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>Commodities were all over the place, bonds weaker, stocks generally stronger on a reaction (supposedly) to Trump caving in on banning Huawei, and generally signalling that he&#8217;s not going to do anything to damage trade with China (any more than it&#8217;s already been&nbsp;damaged).</p>
<p>Stats are all over the place with massive percentage gains in things like <span class="caps">ADP</span> payroll numbers, because of artifically depressed levels last&nbsp;month. </p>
<p>Generally, my feeling is that things are going to slump again, but I have no real evidence for&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>The tanker trade is coming back to life. The short calls on Robin Hood faves is doing <span class="caps">OK</span>, but uses a lot of&nbsp;capital.</p>
<h2>A bit of politics and&nbsp;economics</h2>
<p>It seems that a big sticking point in the <span class="caps">UK</span>&#8217;s negotiation with the <span class="caps">EU</span> is the fact that the <span class="caps">UK</span> wants to stop being bound by <span class="caps">EU</span> rules on state aid.
I just can&#8217;t imagine why we&#8217;d want to die in a ditch for the right to load deadweight costs on ourselves by subsidizing producers.
It&#8217;s as if nobody in government has come across the fact that unsubsidized competitive markets maximize the sum of consumer and producer surplus.
Or, maybe they have, but they want to make sure their party gets enough donations to win the next&nbsp;election.</p>
