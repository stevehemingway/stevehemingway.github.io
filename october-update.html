</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h1><span class="caps">NHDC</span> Draft Local&nbsp;Plan</h1>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Last month I wrote about the development sites
allocated to Knebworth in the Local Plan. This month I will look at the
broader context. Development sites are allocated very rarely. The last
time this happened in North Herts was in 1992. <strong>Once the current Draft
Local Plan is approved the pattern of development in North Herts will be
set for a&nbsp;generation.</strong></p>
<p>Much of the draft plan is available on the <span class="caps">NHDC</span> website, but minor
changes are still being made, so it is not possible to give any links
here. Please check the website itself, and social media for the latest&nbsp;updates.</p>
<p><strong>Implications of Local Plan for Knebworth:</strong> There are several sites
proposed for Knebworth, see map, one in the centre of the village and
the rest for removal from the Green Belt, with dwelling estimates (area
based rule of thumb, not developer proposal) totalling 791, as&nbsp;follows:</p>

<h2>Why is this consultation&nbsp;different:</h2>
<p>Some of you are probably suffering from &#8216;consultation fatigue&#8217;. <span class="caps">NHDC</span> have consulted repeatedly on aspects of the local plan, which is not surprising since it was supposed to be ready by 2011. The most recent consultation, on the so-called <em>Preferred Options</em> was in December 2014 and generated about eight and a half thousand responses from around the District, including a several hundred from&nbsp;Knebworth.</p>
<p>This consultation is different because the responses will be examined by
the Planning Inspector and will feed into the public enquiry where the
Local Plan will finally be adopted (or not). <span class="caps">NHDC</span> will simply collate
the responses and pass them to the Inspector. Responses may be
electronic or on paper, but not by telephone or in&nbsp;person.</p>
<p>Note that, if you submitted comments in response to previous
consultations on the plan and believe that the updated plan does not
fully address your concerns, you should submit your comments so that
they will be received by the Planning&nbsp;Inspector.</p>
<h2>Soundness of Local&nbsp;Plan:</h2>
<p>The Planning Inspector will examine the Draft Local Plan to determine whether it is ‘sound’. A plan is sound if it is ‘<em>Positively prepared</em>, <em>Justified</em>, <em>Effective</em> and <em>Consistent with national policy</em>.’</p>
<h2>Positive&nbsp;Preparation</h2>
<p>This requires that the plan provides for enough
houses, business premises, infrastructure and community facilities. It
also requires that the plan is <em>sustainable</em>, in the sense that it does
not cause irreversible damage to the environment or the well-being of
future generations. Although developers are expected, in principle, to
pay for infrastructure, there is a requirement that the plan defines
what infrastructure is needed. <span class="caps">NHDC</span> take the view that no account may be
taken of &#8216;Brexit&#8217; because it is too early to estimate its effects on
housing&nbsp;numbers.</p>
<h2>Justified</h2>
<p>The plan is <strong>justified</strong> only if it is based on compelling evidence and
that evidence is presented alongside the plan itself. The submitted
draft must be the best of all possible choices. Other choices for the
plan, such as the suggestion that has been made for a &#8216;New Garden City&#8217;,
must be demonstrated to be inferior to the choices in the&nbsp;plan.</p>
<h2>Effective</h2>
<p>The plan is <strong>effective</strong> if it can be implemented within the available
timescale (before 2031). If the plan does not mesh with those of
neighbouring authorities, or the infrastructure required to support it
cannot be built, the plan will fail the effectiveness test. The draft
submission plan calls for around 1,100 house completions a year to be
delivered for the latter of the plan period. This is considerably more
than North Herts has previously&nbsp;achieved.</p>
<h2>Consistent with national&nbsp;policy</h2>
<p>The plan must be <strong>consistent with national policy</strong>. A policy that many
local residents have commented on is the need to avoid changing Green
Belt boundaries, except under exceptional circumstances. Available
sustainable brownfield sites in the District are limited and the vast
bulk of land allocated for proposed housing is on sites which are
currently in the Green Belt. There are many polices in the <span class="caps">NPPF</span> (and the
associated Planning Practice Guidance website): I suggest that residents
consider whether or not the Plan is consistent with the whole of the
<span class="caps">NPPF</span>, and not just the paragraph relating to the Green&nbsp;Belt.</p>
<h2>Timings:</h2>
<p>The <span class="caps">NHDC</span> Cabinet is scheduled to meet on 26th September to approve the current version of the plan to go forward to consultation. It will then become the &#8216;draft submission plan&#8217;. If it is approved, the officers will prepare the material for consultation, and set up the consultation software on the <span class="caps">NHDC</span> website. Readers will be pleased to hear that new, improved software is being used this time, so the frustrations which the experienced trying to make representations on the Preferred Options draft <em>should</em> be a thing of the&nbsp;past.</p>
<p>If all goes according to plan the <strong>consultation period will run from the 19th October to the 30th November</strong>. Again, this period will run over the Christmas holidays, and potentially means that some residents will have a very short window in which to read the documents and make their&nbsp;submissions.</p>
<p>Following the end of the consultation period, the submissions will be categorised by <span class="caps">NHDC</span> and submitted together with the Draft Plan and all other supporting material to the Planning Inspector in the first part of&nbsp;2017.</p>
