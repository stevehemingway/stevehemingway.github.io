</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h2>Inflation is on the rise. What can I use to&nbsp;hedge?</h2>
<p>There is quite a&nbsp;choice:</p>
<ul>
<li>$<span class="caps">PFIX</span> (more about interest rate&nbsp;risk),</li>
<li>$<span class="caps">IVOL</span> (more about being long credit but with crash&nbsp;protection),</li>
<li>$<span class="caps">INFL</span> (mix of commodities, real assets <span class="amp">&amp;</span> equities with pricing&nbsp;power).</li>
</ul>
<p>Talking about inflation, inflation hedges like $<span class="caps">BTU</span>, $<span class="caps">EQR</span>, $<span class="caps">SD</span>, $<span class="caps">SU</span> even $<span class="caps">CL1</span> have all been whacked today.
One party of me wants to think that this is part of a coordinated reverse pump, coordinated by Klaus Schwab, but I just can&#8217;t see them coordinating action in so many&nbsp;markets.</p>
<p>Some very popular (in a pejorative sense) newsletters are now getting very fired up about inflation. 
The latest from HedgeEye is full of doom and gloom. 
I know that the establishment cannot even bear to think about thinking of the consequences of inflation on the (budget) deficit, but are they really playing big markets, like oil? It just seems&nbsp;unlikely.</p>
<h2>Forward indicator suggests <span class="caps">GDP</span> is heading&nbsp;down</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/weekly-economic-index#/interactive">It&#8217;s probably all noise, but that&#8217;s what the <span class="caps">NY</span> Fed&nbsp;says.</a></p>
<h2><span class="caps">DKNG</span> &#8212; not entirely&nbsp;legit?</h2>
<p><a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/draftkings/">Unbeknownst to investors, DraftKings’ merger with SBTech also brings exposure to extensive dealings in black-market gaming, money laundering and organized&nbsp;crime.</a></p>
<p>Bulgaria is a hotbed of criminal activity. This sounds&nbsp;plausible.</p>
<h2>Central bank balance sheets then and&nbsp;now</h2>
<p><a href="https://moneyinsideout.exantedata.com/p/the-remarkable-expansion-of-global?utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=copy">Chris Marsh with a historic and international overview of <span class="caps">CB</span> balance&nbsp;sheets.</a></p>
<p>I am not sure I understand all of this, but I understand some, and that part seems right and is extremely&nbsp;interesting.</p>
<p>It points out that the <span class="caps">ECB</span> cannot start to tighten, ever, because of Target 2&nbsp;balances. </p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/michaelxpettis/status/1405539470741364745?s=20">This thread</a> argues that debt (not just debt purchased by the central bank) was growing unsustainably in China and that this will cause huge problems for the regime there.
I don&#8217;t know enough about China to have an opinion, but clearly China has been addicted to debt-funded creation of vast quantities of physical capital, which it has combined with its seemingly bottomless supply of labour to produce annual growth of 6% for the last couple of decades. 
I guess it makes sense that this won&#8217;t go on for ever, especially with the demographic challenges that China&nbsp;faces.</p>
<h2>Not all that is golden&nbsp;glisters</h2>
<p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4433962-golden-matrix-group-reboot-of-a-toxic-penny-stock-disaster">Golden Matrix is a carbon copy of management&#8217;s former penny stock, Elray Resources, which ran into issues with the <span class="caps">SEC</span>.     While the company only has two actual employees, there is a catalog of <span class="caps">SEC</span> sanctioned individuals and firms that have been involved at Golden Matrix and Elray.     The company&#8217;s operations are a complicated web of related party transactions which obfuscate an otherwise trivial&nbsp;business. </a></p>

<h2>Safe Bulkers: a safe&nbsp;investment?</h2>
<p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4434716-despite-rallying-234-percent-ytd-safe-bulkers-remains-investable">Nearly 8% yield in a growth&nbsp;industry.</a></p>
<p>Not investment&nbsp;advice.</p>
<h2>Banks and&nbsp;billionaires</h2>
<p><a href="https://wallstreetonparade.com/2021/06/propublicas-release-of-leaked-tax-return-data-for-billionaires-why-wall-streets-mega-banks-are-freaking-out/">Maybe banks make a lot of profit from stock trades made by billionaires like Bezos.</a>
It&#8217;s interesting that banks are offering prime brokerage services to entities other than hedge funds.
One thinks that people like Elon Musk would be the ideal customer for a bank like Credit&nbsp;Suisse.</p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>Commodities were massacred today.
<span class="caps">SPX</span> was flat. <span class="caps">NDX</span> up 1%.
Generally a deflationary day, presumably triggered by weak initial claims figures (i.e. higher than expected numbers filing for&nbsp;unemployment).</p>
<h2>Finally</h2>
<p>A big welcome to Michael, who has just signed up to this newsletter. You are number three of millions, my&nbsp;friend!</p>
