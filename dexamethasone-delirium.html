</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h1>Tweeting&nbsp;Trouble</h1>
<p>Trump is trying to row back his threat to abandon talks on stimulus measures with the Dem-controlled Congress.
Markets went up. As&nbsp;always.</p>
<p>Kamala Harris <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Mike Pence had a dull debate.
The polls seem to think that Trump is doomed. 
I wouldn&#8217;t write off the brute yet, but I hope he is beaten although if he wins it would be the best ever argument for quadratic&nbsp;voting.</p>
<p>A huge congressional report which concluded that <span class="caps">FAANG</span> stocks were abusing market power provoked a wide yawn from the stock market. It obviously thinks that the Dems need the donations too much to actually enact legislation with&nbsp;teeth.</p>
<p>Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna  finally got their Nobel Prize for their work on <span class="caps">CRISPR</span>-Cas9.</p>
<h1>Market&nbsp;update</h1>
<p>Equities up globally.
Dollar down.
Commodities mixed: agricultural ones, down, metals up (except steel).
Yields up. 30-year (<span class="caps">US</span>) Treasuries are looking as though they might just have a sniff of inflation.
Gilts are still up, as is the pound. I think at some point the day of reckoning will&nbsp;arrive.</p>
<p>The problem with shorting stocks is that you&#8217;re always vulnerable to a short squeeze.
Some absolute crap has seen strong growth lately, e.g. $<span class="caps">BYND</span>, up 150% <span class="caps">YTD</span>. 
The problem with shorting this stuff is that there&#8217;s probably a tiny free float and it will always go parabolic as soon as you sell. 
$<span class="caps">IRM</span> &#8212; Iron Mountain, a firm which makes money by collecting boxes of documents from big offices and storing it in big warehouses is up 3.6% today. Makes complete sense when nobody is working from home and all documents are sent and stored electronically for the last decade or&nbsp;so. </p>
<p>China Evergrande Group, $<span class="caps">EGRNY</span> (a big China real estate group, which makes electric vehicles as a sideline, which is almost certainly going bankrupt, went up 17% today, on news that it had managed to get some deal with one of its creditors. It&#8217;s probably not shortable, which is a great&nbsp;relief. </p>
<p>The options will have volatilities well north of 60%.
As Fleck says, you can&#8217;t short individual stocks in a rising&nbsp;market.</p>
<p>At some point in the future, it might be worth looking at <a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5e861759a5a3e4585269154a">this list</a> of potential shorts. 
By &#8220;the future,&#8221; I could be talking ten years from now, so whatever you do, don&#8217;t download RobinHood and start destroying&nbsp;wealth.</p>
<h1>Trigger Warning:&nbsp;Politics</h1>
<p><a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/10/07/now-everything-depends-on-us-stimulus-from-billionaires-to-chinas-manufacturers-as-us-national-debt-blows-out/">This semi-rant by Wolf Richer</a> tells you everything you want to know about how <span class="caps">US</span> (and no doubt <span class="caps">UK</span>) citizens are shamelessly abusing their stimulus money by paying down expensive&nbsp;debt.</p>
