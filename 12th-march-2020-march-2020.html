<p>I was pretty busy today. I had to have my French conversation class at Maggie&#8217;s house and I also went to the Club to listen to Partho Shome talk about taxation and&nbsp;India.</p>
<p>Looking at the opening and closing trades, it&#8217;s not at all what I was trying to do. About half the trades were auto close outs. I seem to have taken on more risk, drunk on large profits largely generated from my high gamma <span class="caps">RUT</span> puts. Although I was up a lot, I did not remotely look like a disciplined trader. A number of the single name puts were based on a gut instinct that stock which had not yet fallen very much were doomed to go down. <span class="caps">VZ</span>, <span class="caps">CPB</span> fall into this category. I really know nothing about these names, and I may regret taking the&nbsp;position.</p>
<p>Trump came on <span class="caps">TV</span> to reassure the population. Flights from Schengen were banned. The Fed said it would launch a $1.5B repo facility (bigger than the annual <span class="caps">US</span> defence budget!!). There seems to be a building consensus that the authorities are going to close the&nbsp;markets.</p>
<p>Trading ideas: short <span class="caps">CBOE</span>/<span class="caps">LSE</span>.</p>
