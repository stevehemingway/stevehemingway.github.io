<h2>Lacey calls the&nbsp;crash</h2>
<p>Lacy Hunt, the doyen of commentators on the bond market, and chief economist at Hoisington Investment Management<br>
<a href="https://hoisington.com/pdf/HIM2022Q1NP.pdf">has spoken</a>. His bulletin is titled &#8220;Disaster.&#8221; I am more liberal with exclamation marks. 
Hunt has been a bond bull longer than most people on the planet have been alive, but now he thinks that the Fed is perilously close to losing control of inflation.
It may now be too late to get the toothpaste back in the tube.
He looks at various historical parallels, including the 1972/73 period, and concludes that the monetary easing to get us through the pandemic, 
just like the one needed to finance the Vietnam War, is going to kindle inflation&nbsp;expectations.</p>
<p>He also points out that the inflation which is already being experienced is causing economic harm to a very large part of the <span class="caps">US</span> population. 
He doesn&#8217;t say it, but I will. These people will not be kind to the Democrats in the mid term elections, nor are they likely to be kind in the 2024 presidential election. 
We are going back to Trump, presumably, who will definitely lean on Powell to keep rate&nbsp;low.</p>
<p>Hunt is always worth reading. He points out that the &#8220;dual mandate&#8221; (which is actually three goals: full employment, stable prices and stable bond prices) is undeliverable in practice.
I am not sure that I&#8217;d describe Hunt as a bond bear, but he&#8217;s certainly not very bullish at the moment.
There have been many false dawns for bond bears, and this may be another. Even if we are not at the end of the great bond bull market, 
the end must be within our lifetimes&nbsp;now.</p>
