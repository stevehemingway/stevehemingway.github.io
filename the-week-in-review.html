<h2>The&nbsp;week</h2>
<p>The resignation of Suga, the Japanese <span class="caps">PM</span>, seems to have had a galvanizing effect on the Japanese stock market. 
I don&#8217;t know anything about the politics over there.
My understanding was that he was just a caretaker <span class="caps">PM</span>, brought in because Abe became too ill to carry on.
I assume that there will be no change in ruling party, which presumably means more of the same stagnation.
Anyway, the <span class="caps">TOPIX</span> was&nbsp;up.</p>
<p><span class="caps">US</span> equity markets ground higher. <span class="caps">US</span> stocks (Russell 3000) are up 18% <span class="caps">YTD</span>.
It&#8217;s amazing what the Fed can achieve.
Further gains this week were presumably a reaction to the payrolls print. 
Weak employment growth would imply delayed tapering, and so the band plays&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>The big beneficiary of this monetary policy is real assets, specifically real estate. 
REITs are up 40% YoY. 
This is great news for Blackrock, not so great for ordinary voters who see a house as a place to live, not a financial investment.
The <span class="caps">UK</span> has had a similar boost in house prices, with the result that a number of institutions (most visibly, Lloyds Bank) have decided to invest.
Nothing goes on forever, but even if nominal rates go up, it seems likely that real estate will keep going. 
Supply of real estate responds very slowly to demand, in the <span class="caps">UK</span> hardly at all because of the centrally planned economy in land development rights.
I think a basket of <span class="caps">UK</span> REITs would be worth looking at&nbsp;closely.</p>
<p>As real assets go up, nominal ones tend to lose momentum.
<span class="caps">US</span> bonds ($<span class="caps">IEF</span> and $<span class="caps">LQD</span>) were down. 
I think credit instruments are the canary in the coal mine, but it&#8217;s too early to call an end to the bull&nbsp;run.</p>
<h2>Eat my shorts (© Bart&nbsp;Simpson)</h2>
<p><img alt="e4c23f90d11e7a5eacece44daebe27f1.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/e4c23f90d11e7a5eacece44daebe27f1.png"></p>

Short interest has never been lower. 
But just as a short squeeze can result in a rapid rise in the market, when all the shorts have capitulated, there is nobody left to sell but the passive&nbsp;funds.</p>
<p>This may be nothing, but unlike interest rates, short interest cannot fall below&nbsp;zero.</p>
<h2>The age of&nbsp;oligopoly</h2>
<p>The 19th Century was the age of steam power, the 20th Century was the age of the automobile, the 21st Century could well be shaping up as the age of oligopoly. 
<img alt="44332002c9900fe2687ec077d2243e7b.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/44332002c9900fe2687ec077d2243e7b.png">
It doesn&#8217;t have quite the same ring, and of course everyone thinks that we are living in the Internet Age. 
But the real power of the internet is to allow industries like brewing beer to organize on a global scale.
The way forward was shown by Coca Cola, which expanded globally on the back of the <span class="caps">US</span> Army&#8217;s global deployment in <span class="caps">WWII</span>. 
Technologies like the humble container, fax, the telex, etc. all supported this global expansion.
The advertising industry, which includes companies like Google and Facebook, is suddenly global,
although many advertising agencies had led the way in an earlier&nbsp;generation.</p>
<p>As industries became more concentrated, their lobbying power increased, and they were able to de-fang anti-trust legislation that would otherwise have impeded their progress.
Maybe the <span class="caps">EU</span> will prove resistant to this sort of corporatism, but I wouldn&#8217;t hold my breath.
One suspects that the reason the <span class="caps">EU</span> has opposed the expansion of some global industries is that there are no national champions in these sectors based in the <span class="caps">EU</span>.
Once there are, world markets will continue to be carved up into a small number of pieces, I&nbsp;predict.</p>

This is mad, but suppressing it will just recruit&nbsp;believers.</p>
