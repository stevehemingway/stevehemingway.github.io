<h2>Reflexivity</h2>
<p>I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/FabiusMercurius/status/1387540429520793600">this great thread</a> on reflexivity, George Soros&#8217;s contribution to investing lore.
I have read his book on it a couple of times, and at the end of it I&#8217;ve always&nbsp;thought:</p>
<ul>
<li>wow, is that all there is to&nbsp;it?</li>
<li>so, demand for a security might even go up as the price increases. I can get that, but it won&#8217;t go on forever, right, because otherwise the stock market would just be all $<span class="caps">AAPL</span>, </li>
<li><span class="caps">OK</span>, so regular demand supply curves aren&#8217;t exactly quantitative, but the only thing that matters for trading is when a trend reverses, and Soros doesn&#8217;t really say anything about how to stop&nbsp;this,</li>
<li>umm, technical analysts, chartists and astrologers have chanted mystical incantations over lines on price history plots, and asserted that certain trends would continue/reverse/other for a long time, and yet there are no billionaire chartists that I am aware&nbsp;of,</li>
<li>there is probably something in this, but it&#8217;s not clear how to profit from it other than to be aware of the possibility that trends can continue for a long&nbsp;time.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="2af8e0f704a8677398bc11902940f75b.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/2af8e0f704a8677398bc11902940f75b.png"></p>
<p>One example of the operation of reflexivity is as&nbsp;follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/FabiusMercurius/status/1387545537595863042?s=20">3rd example: Asimovians dream of electric sheep&#8212;er, cars&#8212; <span class="caps">TSLA</span> goes up; enters S&amp;P 500, gets added into index funds and robo advisors; robot buyers hike the stonk; millions of <span class="caps">US</span>-fawning Chinese parvenus adopt it as their new status symbol; stonk go&nbsp;up</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, I&#8217;m still not totally won over, but I sort of see the point better now than after reading a whole book, so I thought I&#8217;d share&nbsp;this.</p>
<h2>The administrative&nbsp;state</h2>
<p><a href="https://wallstreetonparade.com/2021/04/secs-gary-gensler-picks-a-20-year-wall-street-bank-defender-for-his-crime-chief/">Yes, Alex Young K. Oh was a former federal prosecutor, but one of numerous assistant <span class="caps">U.S.</span> Attorneys working in the Southern District of New York more than two decades ago. What Oh has been doing for the past two decades is working as an attorney for Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Garrison, the law firm that major Wall Street banks repeatedly choose [to fight their serial fraud charges](https://bettermarkets.com/sites/default/files/Better%20Markets%20-%20Wall%20Street%27s%20Six%20Biggest%20Bailed-Out%20Banks%<span class="caps">20FINAL</span>.pdf).</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wallstreetonparade.com/2021/04/alex-oh-the-strange-case-of-the-sec-enforcement-chief-who-beat-a-hasty-exit-after-six-days-on-the-job/">And another one</a>.</p>
<p>I really don&#8217;t know much about the <span class="caps">SEC</span>, but I assume if what the Martens write was factually wrong, they&#8217;d be sued to Kingdom Come, given that they regularly attack lawyers and very well connected individuals. I never see this stuff in the mainstream media. Either they think it&#8217;s not worth reporting, or that it&#8217;s better than ordinary people do not learn about these goings&nbsp;on.</p>
<h2>Bill Gates defends <span class="caps">IPR</span></h2>
<p>This is a sort of &#8220;dog bites man&#8221; story. As Mandy Rice-Davies would say &#8220;He would say that, wouldn&#8217;t he?&#8221;
The brilliant newsletter The Ink has a good take on this, <a href="https://the.ink/p/megantompkinsstange">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Pyrogenesis will ignite your returns if you buy&nbsp;puts!</h2>
<p>Basically, a wildly optimistic company in the crowded space of 3-D printing, which may be booking sales to a related&nbsp;entity.</p>
<p><a href="https://marinerresearchgroup.com/2021/04/28/pyr-a-family-affair-rife-with-conflicts-roundtrip-revenues-and-plenty-of-unfulfilled-promises-pt-0-74/">Details&nbsp;here</a></p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p><span class="caps">US</span> yields grind higher as evidence of a rapid bounce piles&nbsp;up. </p>
<ul>
<li><span class="caps">US</span> 10Y at&nbsp;1.638%,</li>
<li><span class="caps">WTI</span> crude at ~$65, up&nbsp;1.7%,</li>
<li><span class="caps">GSCI</span> basket down 0.75%, by poor performance of metals, including precious&nbsp;metals,</li>
<li>equities grind higher in the <span class="caps">US</span>: <span class="caps">SPX</span> up 0.67% to 4211; in Europe drifting&nbsp;lower,</li>
<li><span class="caps">DXY</span> down to 90.56 on a steep&nbsp;downtrend. </li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, fairly reflationary and slightly risk on. No strong&nbsp;trends. </p>
<h2>The end of&nbsp;neo-liberalism?</h2>
<p>It seems that with the election of Biden the small government ideas of Hayek, Friedman, Reagan and Thatcher might be falling out of favour, after four decades in the ascendant.
The religion of neoliberalism is more worshiped in the breach than the observance, but it had set the tone of governments promising fiscal continence even if they failed to deliver it in practice.
With the huge stimulus spending to combat Covid-19, the idea that government spending was a terrible thing has quietly faded away, just as it did in the years after <span class="caps">WWII</span>. 
Unfortunately, when the pendulum swings, it usually goes too far, and we are likely to see the return of wage inflation and price inflation and, maybe even, at some point, defaults on government debt either explicit or via financial&nbsp;repression. </p>
<p>In 1981, this was done by ideologues. In 2021 this will be done by pragmatists who realize that returns to capital have got out of line with returns to other factors of production. 
I am not sure whether this means that the right wing parties will lose out, or they will just steal the clothing of the left wing. 
I think it&#8217;s more likely to be the latter, since the Right  would rather lose their principles than their elections.
This is idle speculation on my part, and is not in any respect a comment on <span class="caps">UK</span>&nbsp;politics.</p>                </article>
