<h2>5-30&nbsp;Steepener</h2>
<p>Lending money to someone for thirty years is a lot riskier than lending to them for one year, or even for five years.
The market&#8217;s price of risk is an interest rate premium. Lending to me is a lot riskier than lending to <span class="caps">HM</span> Treasury, so I pay a higher rate of interest. 
You would have thought that even with the <span class="caps">US</span> Treasury lenders would demand a higher rate to lend for 30 years than for five, but in fact that is not always the case, as the chart shows.
When lending long-term, the biggest risk for the lender is inflation, which will kill real returns.
With inflation at 10%, a yield of 4.5% means that every year one&#8217;s asset is wasting away by 5.5%.
In fact, since April 2021 the premium has evaporated to the point that today it&#8217;s zero. 
In recent years, this spread has almost never got lower than -60bp. 
With inflation getting entrenched, it seems logical that the 30-year rate will start to outpace the 5-year one, but these are odd times, and if the Fed starts buying long-dated Treasuries again, all bets are&nbsp;off.</p>

<h2>The Economist&#8217;s verdict on Sunak:&nbsp;miss</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/10/25/rishi-sunaks-first-job-clearing-up-his-own-mess">Sunak was behind many of the policies which have landed the <span class="caps">UK</span> in the mess that it is in.</a>
This is the verdict of the Economist.
The <span class="caps">UK</span> is in a sorry state, and it&#8217;s verdict is that Sunak is not the guy to lead us out of it. 
I am sure he&#8217;s very clever, but all the evidence of recent elections is that academic intelligence can be a handicap in politics, as it alienates the candidate from the mass of voters, especially when it is coupled with a lack of empathy, which may be another of Sunak&#8217;s&nbsp;attributes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worrying that Sunak has been so keen on stupid ideas, such as freeports, Brexit and &#8216;Eat Out to Help Out&#8217; as well as supporting Boris Johnson in his challenge to Theresa May in&nbsp;2017.</p><p>There are <a href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/the-plot-thickens-the-curve-steepens.html#disqus_thread">comments</a>.</p>                </article>
