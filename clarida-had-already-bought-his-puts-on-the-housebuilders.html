<h2>Fed&nbsp;analysis</h2>
<p>For my money, Alex Manzara is the best commentator on fixed income, &#8220;period&#8221; (as the Americans say).
Macro Alf is pretty good, and there are a lot which are worth reading, but Manzara always leaves me feeling&nbsp;smarter.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/the-end-of-accommodation/">Manzara&#8217;s latest post</a> hits the nail on the head.
He points out the danger of using unemployment as a measure of slack in the economy (not exactly an original idea).
For me, the possibly profit opportunity is the fact that the Fed has signalled that it&#8217;s going to taper <span class="caps">MBS</span> purchases.
It never made sense to me for the Fed to buy securities not issued by the <span class="caps">US</span> Treasury (and fairly short-dated ones at that),
but it did, and this juiced credit and equity&nbsp;markets.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s all going into reverse, officially.
Of course, the Fed has plenty of form for leading the market up the garden path.
Mark Carney was the &#8220;unreliable boyfriend.&#8221; Powell is the serial bigamist. 
However, maaaaybe this time is different and tightening will not be reversed as soon as the equity market mumbles the safe&nbsp;word.</p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>Equity markets continue to be weak.
<span class="caps">US</span> rates at the short end continue to rise. 
The 7-10 year section of the curve seems to be on the point of inverting.
The dollar is very strong: $<span class="caps">DXY</span> now at over 97.
Meme stocks and many profitless tech stocks are down heavily.
$<span class="caps">ARKK</span> is down 40bp, but is down 33% year to date. 
The <span class="caps">NDX</span> is down by 1.4%. $<span class="caps">AAPL</span>, which reports today, might rescue it, but in a bearish market all news is bad news.
Commodities continue to be strong,
with nat. gas up an insane&nbsp;40%.</p>
<p>The market really seems to be settling into a sustained trend. 
The Fed will have a huge battle on its hands to avoid&nbsp;backtracking.</p>
