<h2>Taper&nbsp;Trouble</h2>
<p>Jackson Hole has had a case of Covid, with the result that, for the second year, it will be held over video.
I&#8217;m sure the world&#8217;s central bankers were awfully disappointed, but the planet will thank them for the kilotonnes of <span class="caps">CO</span>~2~ production&nbsp;avoided.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s hard to beat Alex Manzara&#8217;s commentary on Fed matters. 
<a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/taper-groundwork-is-set/">His recent piece</a> is no exception.
He is saying that the Fed won&#8217;t risk another Repo Madness (2019) episode again, at least in the bond markets.
He has said that the Fed will do everything in its power to pin short-term rates to the floor, which should naturally lead to a bit of steepening.
I&#8217;ve been waiting for this for a while. 
We&#8217;ve seen a few basis points increase in the 10Y recently, to approaching 1.4%, but I can&#8217;t see that long-duration rates are going to exactly shoot&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>Manzara reckons that the slowing in the growth of <span class="caps">QE</span> might hit the equities market.
This seems more plausible to me, but remember that Manzara is a Fixed Income guy, not an equity guy, so he is a tourist as far as this asset class is concerned.
Sentiment still holds that <span class="caps">FAANG</span> stocks can only go up in price.
It&#8217;s rational to think that this must be true, but irrationality can last a long time in the&nbsp;markets.</p>
