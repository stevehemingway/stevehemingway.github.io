<h2>The housing&nbsp;market</h2>
<p>Desired saving.
Distrust of securities markets.
<span class="caps">QE</span> and zero interest rate policy driving down returns on money-like assets.
Literal visibility of asset class.
Obsessive coverage of house price indexes by mass media.
High fees and offputting tone of financial advisors.
High visibility and faded memory of house prices falling.
Diverts savings from productive uses.
Calculation that politicians will always step in to prop up a falling housing market in a way that 
they would not for other asset classes.
Broken planning system throttling&nbsp;supply.</p>
<h2>Kashkari</h2>
<p><a href="https://rudy.substack.com/p/pimco-is-a-literal-vampire-potbelly">Rudy does a good takedown of Neel&nbsp;here.</a></p>
<h2>Kwateng</h2>
<p>Kwasi Kwateng, the new Chancellor in the <span class="caps">UK</span> wrote an op-ed in the <span class="caps">FT</span> a few days ago saying that Truss&#8217;s government would be pro-growth. 
He talked about cutting taxes, as if taxes collected do not get spent into the economy.
He talked about the <span class="caps">UK</span> having basically negligible labour productivity growth for at least fifteen years (coincidentally, since the Conservatives have been part or all of government, but he didn&#8217;t mention that), and that some <span class="caps">OECD</span> report had said that financial conditions in the <span class="caps">UK</span> were tightening, not&nbsp;loosening.</p>
<p>He seemed to think that loose financial conditions, and growth in the economy were the same as improved labour productivity. Of course, this is nonsense. Often loose financial conditions lead to slack growth, since the pressure on business to produce more with less is relieved by the cushion of cheap debt. Indeed, debt now for many borrowers must carry an interest rate which is negative in real terms. Maybe crashing equity markets account for a notional tightening, but to spike the punchbowl with vodka at this stage in the party seems like a bad mistake to me. Especially if the BoE is frantically trying to take said punchbowl away. Well, we are overdue for a a bit of civil unrest. I await the outcome with&nbsp;interest.</p>
<h2>Tweet of the&nbsp;day</h2>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I own 17 stocks.<br><br>Here&#39;s why don&#39;t I own each one. ðŸ¤¡<br>(<span class="caps">COMEDY</span>) <a href="https://t.co/MBcYDfCPCc">pic.twitter.com/MBcYDfCPCc</a></p>&mdash; Olivier Marz ðŸ’™ðŸ’› (@ReturnsJourney) <a href="https://twitter.com/ReturnsJourney/status/1567428770277081090?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 7, 2022</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Basically, trashing a bunch of <span class="caps">ARKK</span>-type stocks. Easy to do, but in this case done&nbsp;well. </p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>Oil prices crashed horribly as inventory in the <span class="caps">US</span> went up substantially. Oilprice.com&nbsp;reports:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The American Petroleum Institute (<span class="caps">API</span>) reported aÂ build thisÂ week for crude oil of 3.645 millionÂ barrels, whileÂ <a href="https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/api-weekly-crude-stock-656">analysts predicted</a>Â aÂ draw of 733,000&nbsp;barrels.</p>
<p>The build comes as the Department of Energy released 7.5 millionÂ barrels from theÂ <a href="https://www.spr.doe.gov/dir/dir.html">Strategic Petroleum Reserves</a>Â in the week ending September 2, leaving the <span class="caps">SPR</span> with justÂ 442.5 million&nbsp;barrels.</p>
<p>In the week prior, the <span class="caps">API</span> reported a build in crude oil inventories ofÂ <a href="https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Oil-Prices-Rise-On-Major-Crude-Inventory-Draw.html">593,000 barrels</a>Â after analysts had predicted a draw of 633,000&nbsp;barrels.</p>
<p><span class="caps">WTI</span> fell on Wednesday prior to the data release as the threat of a global recession weighed on the market, adding to fears that additional and expanded Covid-inspired lockdowns in China could dent demand for oil.Â  At 2:30 p.m. <span class="caps">ET</span>, <span class="caps">WTI</span> was trading down 5.44% on the day at $82.18 per barrelâ€”a roughly $10 per barrel dip on the week.Â <a href="https://oilprice.com/oil-price-charts/">Brent crude</a>Â was trading down 4.96% on the day at $88.23â€”an $11 dip on the&nbsp;week.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was all taken to imply that we&#8217;re moving towards a recession, and so bonds firmed, <span class="caps">DX</span> went into retreat, most commodity prices fell. Stock prices generally rose, presumably on the basis that the increased prospect of a collapse in demand will force the Fed to&nbsp;pivot.</p>
