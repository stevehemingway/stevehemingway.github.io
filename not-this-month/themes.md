• The US is operating under something close to an MMT policy framework and this wil continue. That means rates cannot rise above nominal GDP for long. Mark strongly believes the Fed anchors the entire curve and there is a reason 10s never go much more than 300bps over Fed Funds. As such, he thinks Fed Funds are capped wherever you think nominal GDP is (1% population growth + 2% inflation = 2.50%/3.00% max approx..) Productivity factor is hard to quantify.

• US society is not wiling to accept pain. This drives al forms of policy.

• Oil spike will be deflationary just like every other oil spike in the past as it weighs on discretionary spending.

• Commodity prices will stay high but inflation wil dissipate as there is not the characteristic bringing forward of purchases that one would expect in a truly persistent inflation dynamic. Wages are rising and the price level is rising but there is no classic inflationary psychology (panic buying/hoarding).

• Unfortunate that while cheap energy is indisputably the single largest factor that has lifted people out of global poverty, there is no intellectual freedom to debate the merits of ESG policies in developed countries. The debate is settled and contrary opinions are not welcome.

• US demographics are bad but still way better than China, Germany or Japan.

• Active to passive is a fundamental regime change in equity markets. If you’re not long AMZN (for example) you are syntheticaly short AMZN vs. your benchmark and your peers.

• AI and trend following models are solving for slope in equities, not the endpoint. Therefore, valuation is irrelevant to a huge cohort of participants. Problem is, vol-adjusted momentum is reflexive. Models tune to each other and become alike. Syncopation and herding have occurred to an unprecedented degree and this has created one or more interrelated tech bubbles (megacaps and disruptors).

• Zero chance the dolar loses its reserve status in our lifetime. His Dad was in the CIA and always said: The first three things people in war-torn areas want is food, water, and petrol. Fourth thing: US dollars.

## Current Views

• We are still in the haze of the COVID policy response but when the smoke clears: no fiscal juice, high gas prices, and weaker housing markets wil push the US economy off its current robust course.

• If we can get back to 2% Fed Funds and 5% 10-year rates and stay there for a bit, Mark would feel hopeful that some return to normalcy is possible. Positive yields are a fundamental feature of properly-functioning capitalism. Currently we are in a never-ending cycle where we bounce off, then return to the zero bound.
