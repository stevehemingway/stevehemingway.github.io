## It's a long way down from here

## Musky Twitter

[Matt Levine writes even more about Musk and Twitter.](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-05-04/someone-hacked-a-merger)
Whatever you think about Levine's takes on the latest news, one has to admire his prolificacy (yes, it is a word, but I had to look it up). 
He comments on stuff which is baffling to everyone, which is why most commentators steer well clear of it.
This: 

> _Will a re-IPO’ed Musk Twitter just be sort of Musky enough, with Musk-fan retail shareholders and a Musk-aligned board of directors, that it can withstand any pressures on free speech?[2] “This is the town square, an important venue for public communication, so the richest man in the world must take it private” always struck me as a very weird argument, but “… and then take it public again almost immediately” adds some new complications._

is utterly wonderful, imho.

For what it's worth, I think Musk is a psychopath, but I have to agree that if anyone can make Twitter's stock price go to the moon, it's him.

## Wrap

Commodities sagged, bonds rallied, the USD was up a bit. Equities were subdued.
Generally, a risk-neutral day.
