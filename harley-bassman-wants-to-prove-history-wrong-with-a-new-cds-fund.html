</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>By Katie Greifeld  (Bloomberg) &#8212; Making cash in the world of credit insurance<br>
typically involves a special license and strategies that cost<br>
millions of dollars to run. Rates expert Harley Bassman wants to<br>
do it in a low-cost exchange-traded fund.<br>
Bassman, who created the <span class="caps">MOVE</span> Index to track Treasury<br>
volatility, is co-manager for the Simplify Credit Hedge <span class="caps">ETF</span><br>
(ticker <span class="caps">CDX</span>), a proposed new fund that will invest up to 50% of<br>
its assets in credit-default swap index payer options, according<br>
to a filing Tuesday. Those are derivatives that allow investors<br>
to either hedge their position in a company’s bonds or to make a<br>
directional wager.<br>
The <span class="caps">ETF</span> is designed to pay off when turmoil hits credit<br>
markets. Options held by the fund can guard against widening<br>
spreads by offering the right to buy protection against default<br>
on over 100 North American and emerging-market companies.<br>
If that sounds complicated, it is. Previous products tied<br>
to default swaps have struggled to gather assets or shuttered.<br>
<span class="caps">CDS</span> trading is normally the province of hedge funds and other<br>
institutional players, requiring a hard-to-get license known as<br>
an <span class="caps">ISDA</span> Master Agreement and a large pools of assets.<br>
Still, the timing may be fortuitous, with credit markets<br>
looking frothy and S&amp;P Global Ratings warning of rising default<br>
risk amid unprecedented global debt issuance.<br>
“There’s really not many ways available in tradeable format<br>
to protect against the credit markets freezing,” said David<br>
Schawel, chief investment officer at Family Management Corp.<br>
“This seems to be a viable one.”<br>
The recent spike in Treasury yields amid rising concerns<br>
about inflation sparked a selloff in <span class="caps">U.S.</span> investment-grade<br>
credit, the worst-performing fixed income asset class this year.<br>
Corporate bonds with the highest credit ratings tend to have the<br>
most duration, making them vulnerable to rates moves. The market<br>
is also under pressure from excess supply.<br>
In addition to swap index options, the Simplify fund will<br>
invest in Treasuries, inflation-protected securities, money-<br>
market funds and investment-grade corporate debt via ETFs,<br>
according to the filing. It’s expected to cost 0.5% a year.<br>
Bassman is a famous industry figure, having specialized in<br>
fixed-income derivatives and structured products during his 26-<br>
year career at Merrill Lynch, according to his personal website.<br>
He later worked at Credit Suisse Group <span class="caps">AG</span> and Pimco before<br>
joining&nbsp;Simplify.  </p>
<p>Troubled&nbsp;History  </p>
<p>The fund is the latest in a list of <span class="caps">CDS</span> products, most of<br>
which have faltered.<br>
The ProShares <span class="caps">CDS</span> North American High Yield Credit <span class="caps">ETF</span><br>
launched in 2014, but liquidated a few years later after<br>
struggling to attract assets. In Europe, the Tabula North<br>
American <span class="caps">CDX</span> High Yield Credit Short fund (ticker <span class="caps">TABS</span>) holds<br>
less than $1 million after launching in July. <span class="caps">DWS</span> Investments<br>
recently reduced the number of credit derivative ETFs it offers<br>
through its XTrackers label to three from a peak of 15 in 2012.<br>
“This <span class="caps">ETF</span> will have its work cut out for it competing with<br>
the massively liquid options on <span class="caps">HYG</span>, which many currently use as<br>
way to hedge credit risk or bet against it,” said Eric Balchunas<br>
of Bloomberg Intelligence, referring to the $22 billion iShares<br>
iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond <span class="caps">ETF</span>.<br>
Even though the <span class="caps">CDS</span> market is largely inaccessible to<br>
individual investors right now, it’s unclear if retail traders<br>
would even want exposure to default swaps, he added.<br>
While more tactical investors may trade in and out of the<br>
product, there are long stretches of middling performance<br>
associated with such instruments, which are designed to pay out<br>
only in a crisis.<br>
“Shorting credit is easier said than done,” said Peter<br>
Tchir, head of macro strategy at Academy Securities. “It will be<br>
interesting to see if this mix of tools available to the<br>
managers can be harnessed to deliver returns.”<br>
The end result may be that the fund occupies a niche<br>
similar to its underlying strategy, despite the easy access of<br>
an <span class="caps">ETF</span> wrapper.<br>
“While likely more complicated initially for retail<br>
investors, this fund could appeal to institutions,” said Todd<br>
Rosenbluth, <span class="caps">CFRA</span>’s director of <span class="caps">ETF</span>&nbsp;research.  </p>
