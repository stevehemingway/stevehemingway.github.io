</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h1>April&nbsp;Overview</h1>
<h2>Current state of&nbsp;play</h2>
<p>Oil is very weak on a combination of demand and supply. Donald J Pump made it go up 5% on 3rd April, but surely it&#8217;s trend will not be reversed. The &#8220;Incredible Hulks&#8221; trade should survive, but <span class="caps">DJP</span> has badly injured&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><span class="caps">US</span> Equities, certainly large cap, must be still too expensive. Idea: find the biggest buyback stocks. Without buybacks, these may be&nbsp;vulnerable.</p>
<p>The big risk is that <span class="caps">QE</span> infinity will lift all boats. I am not sure what to do about this. Maybe buy corp. credit and short stocks. But if bond issuers can raise capital at (likely) negative rates, won&#8217;t that support their share&nbsp;prices?</p>
<p>The biggest beneficiary of <span class="caps">QE</span> inf. will be govt. bonds. I find it very hard to buy a ten-year at 0.6% but I guess if the yield goes negative I&#8217;ll make money. As always, knowing what will happen to inflation is the key to profits, and as usual I don&#8217;t have a clue about what will&nbsp;happen.</p>
<p>Another tack is to buy low quality stuff, like <span class="caps">MBS</span> ETFs and companies suspected of fraud. Although the authorities never unveil the fraud, sometimes funding stress does. Obviously, your shorting of <span class="caps">TSLA</span>, which is a prime example of a fraud, has not gone so well even&nbsp;lately.</p>
<h2>Insurance</h2>
<p>Insurance companies rely on returns on their float to cover the cost of their claims. Deaths will be up a bit (maybe overall down though, because of less pollution and less general infection). Negative risk-free yields and defaults on corporate debt will increase liabilities, and reduce assets: not a good combo. The other problem is companies who liabilities which are defined benefit pensions. This will mainly be municipals, but also some paternalistic&nbsp;employers.</p>
<h2>When Markets are due for a&nbsp;correction</h2>
<p>No matter how over valued or insane valuations are, even that arbitrage opportunities exist, it&#8217;s still foolish to trade on the basis that the market will suddenly wake up to your view before drifting a long way further along the path that it had previously been&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>Markets are self-fulfilling&nbsp;prophesies.</p>
<h2>Perma Bear or Perma&nbsp;Bull?</h2>
<p><a href="https://valuestockgeek.com/2020/04/12/what-the-perma-bulls-and-perma-bears-get-wrong/">This</a> is a fantastically balanced piece by Value Stock Geek. He says&nbsp;that:</p>
<ul>
<li>being ideological is a barrier to being a successful&nbsp;investor,</li>
<li>the Fed is not the author of all our misfortune, nor is it the omnipotent wizard that can stop all&nbsp;recessions,</li>
<li>the markets are not as rational as Eugene Fama would like them to be but they are also not as irrational as the ideologues&nbsp;think,</li>
<li>that, actually, it is best to avoid overreacting to any market&nbsp;moves.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some good links to videos from Peter Lynch and Milton Friedman. There is quite a good link to an old Onion piece making fun of the money&nbsp;illusion.</p>
<h2>The worst stocks will likely have the biggest&nbsp;recoveries</h2>
<p>This is a very important principle. Often, a big turnover company with poor margins will be pushed into loss by a bad economy. When the economy bounces back, even a bit, the eps can roar back (even though earnings yield is still pretty crap). You also have a momentum thing, and a liquidity thing. Basically, something illiquid and high beta should not be shorted, no matter how much a basket case it seems. Except in tiny&nbsp;size.</p>
<h2>Gold&nbsp;nervousness</h2>
<p>Sold a few <span class="caps">MU</span>. Noticed that <span class="caps">GC</span> was damaging my bottom line and decided to reduce my exposure by writing some calls. It&#8217;s complicated because I have a stop at the strike price. Prob. better cancel the&nbsp;stop.</p>
<h1>Nobody Knows&nbsp;Anything</h1>
<p>Sound words of advice Josh Brown on <span class="caps">CNBC</span> said as he and Brad Gerstner of Altimeter Capital discussed the markets, (and I&nbsp;paraphrase):</p>
<p>The person you want to run away from now is the person who <span class="caps">KNOWS</span> what will&nbsp;happen.</p>
<p>Just before that Adam and I were chatting and shared these simple&nbsp;thoughts:</p>
<p>Sound words of advice The fact is we are grasping at straws and hoping. In fact, the first words I typed today&nbsp;were:</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">GBP</span> is the strongest and the <span class="caps">USD</span> is the weakest as <span class="caps">NA</span> traders enter for the day as stocks (and yields) move back higher on hope. Hope for a stimulus package passage, hope that the Fed&#8217;s stimulus helps the economy, hope that the virus does not get too outta hand, and hope that the deficits being built will one day ease. Yes&#8230; &#8220;Hope&#8221; is part of trading. No one &#8220;knows&#8221; for sure, or even close to &#8220;knows&#8221;, what will happen - especially now. We will, and should have a &#8220;hard time&nbsp;believing&#8221;.</p>
<p>Now when the dust settles, there will be those that &#8220;knew all along&#8221;. Fine. Have your day on twitter or in a comment. However, if you did not include a level of risk&#8230;you are just flipping a coin in my&nbsp;eyes.</p>
<p>For me, I would rather remain humble and listen to those that are humble who understand where they are&nbsp;wrong.</p>
<p>I will also base my thoughts on what I see in the charts, because it tells a story to me. That story has included in it, a lot of &#8220;IFs&#8221;. In fact, in a post earlier today titled &#8220;The <span class="caps">USDJPY</span> remains in the middle of the 3 day range. Buyers keep more of the bias&#8221;, I&nbsp;wrote:</p>
<p>Intraday, the price action is up and down today. The lows have stalled along a trend line. The price is trading around the 50% of the move down from yesterday&#8217;s highs at 110.828. The price is above the 100 and 200 bar MAs at 110.543 and 110.63 currently. The price has been able to stay above the 200 bar <span class="caps">MA</span> since breaking about an hour or so ago. If the price can stay above the 200 bar <span class="caps">MA</span> (green line), that keeps the buyers in control intraday. Move below the 200 and 100 bar <span class="caps">MA</span> (blue line) and the intraday sellers are back in firm control. The last two sentences are my way of saying &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221; or &#8220;I hope&#8221;. However, the &#8220;<span class="caps">IF</span>&#8221; is my way of also saying &#8220;That is my stop area. Things are good as long as that condition remains&nbsp;true.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some people don&#8217;t like that. Some people are not like that. They feel that you have to have a &#8220;conviction&#8221;. &#8220;Buy&#8230;. it is going up&#8221; or &#8220;Stop with all the&nbsp;&#8220;IFs.&#8221;.</p>
<p>My response is &#8220;What makes me know more than &#8220;the market&#8221;? What makes my crystal ball so much clearer than all the others out there?&#8221; Don&#8217;t be&nbsp;silly.</p>
<p>What I know is what I see. If I see it in the chart, my feeling is others from all around the world can see it too. In fact I try to make it simple to all (or those that read my posts). I post what I see (post the chart(s)). I comment on what I see with arrows and words, but do &#8220;I know for sure?&#8221; <span class="caps">NOPE</span>! It is contingent on the &#8220;<span class="caps">IF</span> the price stays above the&#8230;..blah, blah,&nbsp;blah&#8221;.</p>
<p>The point is traders, if you <span class="caps">KNOW</span> what will happen, run away from yourself. Instead, find where the &#8220;IFs&#8221; are that will tell you where you are wrong, and you will have the right mindset for&nbsp;trading.</p>
<p>When Stanley Druckenmiller complains, you know it&#8217;s tough. He&#8217;s a billionaire and undoubtedly one of the greatest traders of all&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>He laments how algos and quants have changed the&nbsp;game.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I made 30 percent a year for 30 years. Now, we aren&#8217;t even in the same zip code, much less the same state,&#8221; he&nbsp;said.</p>
<p>It might be easy to dismiss him as a has-been but he&#8217;s not just complaining, he outlines how markets have&nbsp;changed.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>You&#8217;re getting noise that used to mean something, and now it doesn&#8217;t mean anything,&#8221; he&nbsp;says.</p>
<p>Volatility used to be something that traders and active fund managers loved. It was seen as an opportunity but not any&nbsp;longer.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Volatility is only good if it&#8217;s part of the trend and it&#8217;s giving you entry points within a trend,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When you&#8217;re going up and down, but there&#8217;s no real trend, that&#8217;s a nightmare. You might think that a volatility move is the beginning of a trend and get yourself&nbsp;whipsawed.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the end of the day, that&#8217;s the lay of the land now. People will always find ways to make money and today is no&nbsp;different.</p>
<p>Druckenmiller highlights the things that will always be key, including curiosity, open-mindedness and&nbsp;courage.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I&#8217;ve never made a buy at a low that I didn&#8217;t just feel terrible and scared to death making it,&#8221; he&nbsp;said.</p>
