<h2>25 - 4 ==&nbsp;9?</h2>
<p>A lot of the financial world is concerned with valuation.
It would seem that we can know what the <span class="caps">SPX</span> is valued at.
I write a (mostly) daily paragraph about how valuations of a small range of liquid assets has moved.
It might be hard to predict how these assets will move in the future, but it surely isn&#8217;t hard to know where they are now.&nbsp;Surely!</p>
<p>Well, Doomberg points out that it can be, and the more private a market it is, the more difficult it is.
We are seeing very low volatility. Many contracts that were quite liquid a few months ago never trade.
The exchange comes up with a price, but given the importance to some individuals to have the <em>right</em> price, it&#8217;s not surprising that there is a lot of&nbsp;manipulation.</p>
<p>To me, at least, it seems clear that the price of Tesla ($<span class="caps">TSLA</span>) is constantly manipulated. 
The same goes for $<span class="caps">AMC</span>, $<span class="caps">GME</span>, most private equity funds. You name it, it&#8217;s&nbsp;manipulated.</p>
<p>Doomberg explains how this is sometimes done, and goes into quite a bit of detail on the valuation of <span class="caps">OYO</span> Rooms, a Softbank-backed Indian startup. Parallels with WeWork abound. Will things work out like WeWork (i.e. not very well)?
I have no idea, but it&#8217;s tempting to think that Doomberg is onto&nbsp;something.</p>
<p>This whole problem is amplified by cheap borrowing costs. If money is free, borrowing it to buy your own stock makes sense. 
Virtually every company in the <span class="caps">SP500</span> is doing it. Executive compensation is going through the roof. 
The <span class="caps">US</span> gets floods of foreign capital to counterbalance its chronic current account deficit.
The <span class="caps">US</span> President gets to brag about what a fantastic job he&#8217;s doing, citing as evidence the level of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. This arrangement has run and run. How could it possibly go&nbsp;wrong?</p>
<p>The bears have given lots of ways, but none has come to pass. With the force of the <span class="caps">US</span> Treasury and the Fed behind the <em>status quo ante</em> it only the very brave would bet against it. But still, if something cannot go on forever, it will stop. Isn&#8217;t that what Herb Stein&nbsp;said?</p>
<p>The heading is based on a presentation from Masa San, the boss of Softbank.
He gave a presentation arguing that you should not count liabilities when valuing assets in his fund. The missing $12 (billion) is accounted for by&nbsp;them.</p>
