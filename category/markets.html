<h2>Who can we&nbsp;believe?</h2>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>The first casualty of war is the truth.&#8221; 
&#8220;They are not even pretending anymore. &#8212; Ben&nbsp;Hunt&#8221;</p>
<p>Control of the narrative is very important. 
We all learn that to get our own way, we have to persuade others of the correctness of our thinking.
The easiest way to do this is to present one side of the story.
Presenting one side of the story is a core competence of a politician. 
That&#8217;s why barristers (advocates) do so well as politicians.
Their day job is convince a jury of the correctness of their&nbsp;argument.</p>

<h2>Will the Ukraine war affect <span class="caps">UK</span> property&nbsp;prices?</h2>
<p>I don&#8217;t know. Nobody does. I&#8217;ll have a&nbsp;stab:</p>
<ul>
<li>sanctions on their own will not make much difference to <span class="caps">UK</span> house prices.  Some top-end properties will have been purchased by oligarchs, but this is a market that is quite distinct from any rental property either of us is likely to&nbsp;own,</li>
<li>energy price rises will feed into inflation, which ultimately will feed into salaries, which will in turn feed into house prices. In the long term, houses are the ultimate real asset. Interest rates may go up in the short term, though, which might make mortgages less available, which might push house prices&nbsp;down,</li>
<li>the desire to &#8220;re-shore&#8221; production to the west will be a positive for the <span class="caps">UK</span>, which will support house prices (we don&#8217;t import much other than oil from Russia, but generally the exposure to overseas suppliers will be seen as something we want to reduce). Unemployment is already low, compared to the Eurozone, so if we avoid panicking over inflation we should see some wage&nbsp;growth,</li>
<li>the pound will probably go down. Our current account deficit is 3.5%, which puts us between Venezuela and Columbia in the rankings. (And Columbia probably has more exports than are recorded in official statistics!). We&#8217;ve sustained this because we get a lot of foreign direct investment, but that&#8217;s largely stopped because we are now out of the <span class="caps">EU</span>. If the pound goes down, we will see even more&nbsp;inflation.</li>
<li>ordinary people in the <span class="caps">UK</span> have seen stocks (<span class="caps">FTSE</span>) go nowhere in a decade. They do not trust fund managers. They get a modest yield on a house, and this is something the value of which goes to zero because some stock exchange is subject to&nbsp;sanctions,</li>
<li>banks continue to be happy to lend to finance residential property. In fact, I think that over 80% of all bank lending is linked to&nbsp;this.</li>
</ul>
<p>​Having said all this, nothing is certain, and you should do your own research.&nbsp;​</p>                </article>
