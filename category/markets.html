<p>I stole this chart from the excellent chartpoint.com. <a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/archegos-capital-credit-suisse-nomura-goldman-sachs-morgan-stanley-092127768.html">The forced liquidation of Archegos Capital</a> over the weekend seems to have made remarkably little impression on the wider market. The leverage of that thing seems amazing, but I am prepared to put serious money (well, <span class="caps">GBP</span> 5) on a bet that there are plenty more where Archegos comes&nbsp;from.</p>
<p><img alt="2666d8050ec106adb6f99ffd8c0e64f2.png" src="2666d8050ec106adb6f99ffd8c0e64f2.png"></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>equities pretty flat, <span class="caps">DJI</span> hits <span class="caps">ATH</span>,&nbsp;again,</li>
<li>bonds slightly inflationary: 10Y Treas. now at&nbsp;1.71%,</li>
<li>commodities up a few pc: <span class="caps">GSCI</span> up&nbsp;2.53%,</li>
<li><span class="caps">DXY</span> continues to grind higher: nearly 93&nbsp;now.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Chart</h1>
<p>I&#8217;m always posting charts from <span class="caps">FRED</span>, but just to show there are no hard feelings, here is a chart from Trading Economics, which is about the <span class="caps">UK</span>.
The explosion of debt is not so much, but (i) the measure is highly understated because of the large unfunded pension liabilities the <span class="caps">UK</span> has, (ii) the steady rise of <span class="caps">GDP</span> makes it seem … not so bad. 100% of <span class="caps">GDP</span> is well above the 60% maximum permitted under the &#8216;Growth and Stability Pact&#8217; that no longer applies now we are out of the <span class="caps">EU</span>. It&#8217;s funny how when push comes to shove, these good intentions pave the road to&nbsp;hell.</p>

<h1>Soapbox</h1>
<p>The current state of care work in the <span class="caps">UK</span> is chaotic. It is the health service before 1945. A patchwork of badly paid carers offer substandard care to poor people who still can&#8217;t afford it. Much personal care to individuals who have age-related conditions which, should they be experienced by younger individuals, would be counted as medical conditions (and thus due medical care). Labelling doesn&#8217;t matter, except it makes a big difference to who picks up the tab. Care for people with a medical condition is free. The support for this policy in the <span class="caps">UK</span> is practically a national religion. Care for the elderly, frail and infirm is very expensive&nbsp;indeed.</p>
<p>Rather than spend time having sterile debates about whether or not people have to give up their house to pay for this care (as against give up their portfolio of income generating securities they bought with the proceeds of the sale of their house), we should just put the two systems on the same basis. Of course, this will mean bureaucracy, inefficiency, and explosion of a management class, slow decision making. But we have that already in the <span class="caps">NHS</span>, and we seem, collectively, to think that these things are a price worth&nbsp;paying.</p>                </article>
