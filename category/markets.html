<h2>Consumer&nbsp;credit</h2>
<p>The pandemic saw a collapse in borrowing, because people could not go out and spend. The best they could do was order electronic devices from Amazon and takeaway meals from Uber Eats. Now things are very&nbsp;different.</p>
<p><img alt="Consumer credit is soaring" src="https://thedailyshot.com/wp-content/uploads/US-CC-Balances2204080437.png"></p>
<p>These people have incomes, but they are feeling the impact of inflation.
They will look to strike or find a new, better-paying,&nbsp;job.</p>
<h2>Truth</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Gregory House : There&#8217;s a reason that everybody lies. It works. It what allows society to function, it&#8217;s what separates man from&nbsp;beast.</p>
<p>Dr. James Wilson : Oh, I thought that was our&nbsp;thumbs.</p>
<p>Dr. Gregory House : You wanna know every place your mom&#8217;s thumb has&nbsp;been?</p>
<p>Dr. James Wilson : I&#8217;m sorry I missed rehearsal. Am I taking the &#8220;truth is good&#8221; side? Don&#8217;t you usually take that&nbsp;part?</p>
<p>Dr. Gregory House : Lies are a tool, they can be used either for good&#8230; No wait, I got a better one. Lies are like children. Hard work, but they&#8217;re worth it. Because the future depends on&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Dr. James Wilson : You are so full of love&#8230; or&nbsp;something.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are good reasons to lie. Mankind cannot stand too much honesty. But there are also bad reasons to lie. Market commentary is frequently tainted with the bad reason. 
When some random substack newsletter author tells his subscribers that such and such a stock is a steal, he probably believes it.
He has also probably already purchased some (or done the equivalent, such as selling puts or buying calls). 
It&#8217;s understandable: he&#8217;s sharing the benefits of the research he did, in exchange for what will probably be a very modest uplift in the price of the stock.
Unless he&#8217;s Jim Cramer or Elon&nbsp;Musk.</p>
<p>People lie to kids. They tell them that anything is possible, that the American Dream is still alive and well. 
It&#8217;s rational to tell kids that they world is their oyster, and that they should follow their passion. 
This is kind, but it can be cruel. Most kids will never make it to be an opera singer, or a pop star, or a premiership footballer.
Even the most talented kids will wilt in the heat of the sort of competition that exists at the&nbsp;top.</p>
<p>Very many kids go to university, study for masters and doctoral degrees. Orders of magnitude more young people obtain advanced degrees, but the idea
that they will all better off as a new cohort is simply wrong, unless jobs that will increase in productivity as a result. 
The reality is that professional job openings in accountancy and law will  decline because  artificial intelligence will eventually be more widely introduced. Speaking as someone who has endured more than his fair share of the paper-bound and glacial process of buying and selling houses, it&#8217;s cle,It is taking longer than expected, but just imagine how many counter staff banks employed forty years ago, relative to now.
Universities do not, as far as I can tell, attempt to match what they teach to demand for jobs. They might argue that nobody knows what the pattern of demand might be in a generation&#8217;s time, so they can&#8217;t be expected to design courses with it in mind.
But in practice they teach vast numbers of students &#8220;Business studies&#8221;, which is just about the opposite of a training someone to think and be&nbsp;analytical. </p>
<p>The worst sort of lie, though, is the one that shirks our duty to give honest evaluation and feedback.
When we want to know, we want to know. 
To praise someone for average achievement is not a kindness. It is a dereliction of&nbsp;duty.</p>
