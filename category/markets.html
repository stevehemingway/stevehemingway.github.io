<h2>Markets&nbsp;position</h2>
<p>The <span class="caps">US</span> equity markets are mostly at or near all time highs. The <span class="caps">SPX</span> P/E ratio is around 31, according to something I read, although measuring this is probably tricky as headline earnings are almost never <span class="caps">GAAP</span> now, but &#8220;adjusted.&#8221; It seems hard to believe that monetary conditions will get any looser, with inflation running at double target, even with the opaque &#8220;average inflation targetting&#8221; that the Fed endlessly uses to justify delay in tightening. Although we are near all-time highs, with <span class="caps">NDX</span> dropping 2.5% on the odd day recently, momentum is faltering.
We&#8217;ve probably been here before, but it feels different this time (as it always&nbsp;does).</p>
<p>Consensus forecasts by analysts have been breaking records. But, for me, analyst forecasts are really backward looking. A sell-side guy never wants to spook the buy-side clients of his employer, so is always looking at the world through rose-coloured glasses. It&#8217;s easy to beat estimates by 20% when your company has been in hibernation for a year. Continuing to do so when all your costs, from labour to raw materials, are&nbsp;rocketing.</p>
<p>Labour is a particular problem. There is a big churn in the labour market. Many people are quitting (or not coming back from furlough), and others have discovered that when they change jobs they get a much better salary uplift than when they soldier on. As <span class="caps">GDP</span> slows, but labour costs continue to rise, this will squeeze margins and depress&nbsp;stocks.</p>
<h2>No new oil&nbsp;projects</h2>
<p><a href="https://carbontracker.org/reports/adapt-to-survive/?mc_cid=328d1d532b">This report</a> says that if govts. are serious about controlling rising temperatures, a lot of oil and gas reserves will be &#8220;stranded.&#8221; 
The chart shows most of the major oil producers. 
It&#8217;s interesting that Pioneer and Aramco have almost all their reserves still developable under the 
<span class="caps">IEA</span> Sustainable Development Scenario (<span class="caps">SDS</span>) but the vast bulk of Ecopetrols reserves could not be developed ever, under this scenario.
(Ecopetrol? me neither.) 
Anyway, it&#8217;s an interesting angle on these development companies. 
Devon, Petrobas, Hess, <span class="caps">CNRL</span> all look well positioned from this&nbsp;perspective.</p>
<h2>Debt&nbsp;Ceiling</h2>
<p>The <span class="caps">US</span> is a foreign country. 
They do things differently there.
The idea of having a ceiling on the total amount of debt outstanding is a familiar one.
The laughably named &#8220;Growth and Stability Pact&#8221; that throttled growth and created instability is a case in point.
But at least the debt limit in it didn&#8217;t create a sudden death date, and scenes of civil servants being sent home on unpaid leave.
It&#8217;s insane, but yet another political cudgel, this time used by the Republicans to bash Biden.
Politics really is the ugly game, played by ugly&nbsp;players.</p>
<h2>Electric&nbsp;machines</h2>
<p>$F, Ford is doing well. 
It&#8217;s making lots of electric vehicles now. 
I would have thought that a short $<span class="caps">TSLA</span>/ long $F pairs trade might be&nbsp;interesting.</p>
<h2>What ever happened to&nbsp;ideology?</h2>
<p>One of my favourite podcasts is <a href="https://www.capitalisnt.com">Capitalisnt</a>. I&#8217;ve been a fan of Luigi Zingales for a long time, but his co-host Bethany McLean is the perfect foil.
They are not ideological, but they are analytical. 
They had <a href="https://www.capitalisnt.com/episodes/why-capitalism-isnt-without-democracy">a repeat episode</a> this week, which you might even be able to listen to embedded in this&nbsp;page:</p>
<iframe height="200px" width="100%" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless src="https://player.simplecast.com/bf3fe997-c135-43ea-902c-0fcfdd6995bf?dark=false"></iframe>

<p>The format for this particular episode is unusual, in that there is no guest invited on to advocate for a particular point of view. The two hosts discuss how important democracy to allow capitalism to function. Zingales&#8217; position is that it is absolutely critical because, as he says, it puts the whole citizenry in the position of the referee, so that attempts to bribe the referee (what happens in almost every society, autocratic or not) leave the public better off. Of course, &#8216;the public&#8217; here might be just a &#8216;winning coalition&#8217; in the jargon of selectorate theory, but that&#8217;s a lot better than just a few&nbsp;oligarchs.</p>
<p>Although Zingales is far from being an ideologue, he suggests that the capture of the Democrats and Republicans in the <span class="caps">US</span> by the plutocrats is partly the result of the end of ideology following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Interestingly, he pointed out that in his native country, Italy, when communists were elected to government they tended to be squeaky clean, because of the distaste for venality that their ideology gave&nbsp;them.</p>
<h2>Headhunter&nbsp;Group</h2>
<p>I don&#8217;t really associate Russia with <span class="caps">IT</span> excellence, but actually it has a few pretty strong firms. Yandex, Mail.Ru, and (I know realize) Headhunter Group (<span class="caps">HHR</span>:<span class="caps">NAQ</span>). The price action of $<span class="caps">HHR</span> has been nothing short of spectacular.
There is very good <a href="https://macro-ops.com/headhunter-hhr-one-of-the-best-network-effect-businesses-ive-ever-seen/">write up by Brandon at Macro Ops</a>.
Russia is a kleptocracy, but kleptocrats need stonks to go up too, so I think that this one might be worth&nbsp;tracking.</p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>This was an odd sort of day. Quite a few equity markets recovered from yesterday&#8217;s weakness, but Far Eastern exchanges were weak.
The <span class="caps">AUD</span> was weak, and the <span class="caps">US</span> dollar was strong, indicating a macro-level risk off sentiment.
Nat gas crashed 7%, but most other hydrocarbon energy commodities were up.
Bonds seem unfazed, although this might be an illusion, with inflation fears exactly offsetting the flight to fixed income that would normally be seen with a 0.7% jump in <span class="caps">DXY</span>. <span class="caps">GBP</span> was down 0.9% vs <span class="caps">USD</span>. 
Gilts will struggle in this kind of environment. The <span class="caps">UK</span> is running a trade deficit of <span class="caps">GBP</span> 60 B per year. That is going to weigh heavily on the currency, and a weak pound is incompatible with low gilt yields. The forecast for the current account is for it to get much worse: <span class="caps">GBP</span> 22.6 B quarterly. Somehow the forecasts are for Sterling to remain fairly&nbsp;flat. </p>
<p>Precious metals were weak. The momentum is endlessly down. At some point gold will catch a bid, but for the moment everyone is dumping it for bitcoins. 
Oh, well <span class="caps">BTC</span> was down 0.3% vs <span class="caps">USD</span>, but still up 40% on the&nbsp;year.</p>
