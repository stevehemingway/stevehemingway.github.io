&lt;h2&gt;The&amp;nbsp;future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanley Druckenmiller, possibly the best trader of all time, said something one time about a high proportion (40%) of his calls being wrong.

&lt;h2&gt;The&amp;nbsp;future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanley Druckenmiller, possibly the best trader of all time, said something one time about a high proportion (40%) of his calls being wrong. 
The market is basically valuing stuff right, most of the time. 
Of course, trends go on too far and valuations become untethered from reality, but mostly the valuation is right, 
in the sense that the price today is an good guide to the price tomorrow (give or take some carry&amp;nbsp;adjustment).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, things are looking as though they are looking iffy now, and it seems to me that we may be close to a turning point&amp;nbsp;in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;money-burning early stage tech (I don&amp;#8217;t have a favourite example, but Atomera ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATOM&lt;/span&gt;) looks as though it might be an&amp;nbsp;example),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;house builders. Interest rates are going up, central banks are tightening. They do that by killing interest-rate sensitive bits of the real economy such as&amp;nbsp;housebuilders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yield curve flattening. This can be done by (e.g. going long shorter dated treasuries, and short longer-dated ones, in such a way that a parallel shift of the discount curve causes no&amp;nbsp;pain),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial metals, such as copper. This has had a good run, but if capital spending is going to get killed off, demand will fall quicker than&amp;nbsp;supply,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China. I hate China, but it&amp;#8217;s hated by everyone right now (especially as Pooh Bear is such a fan of Putin), but when the last bull has capitulated, it might be time to buy. I am cautious about this, because it feels like the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; might start rising to its natural level, which will be a big headwind for China&amp;nbsp;equities,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil and Latam. These produce food commodities and energy. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, Chile produces copper, which I said I&amp;#8217;m bearish on, but mostly it&amp;#8217;s food. In an inflationary environment, it&amp;#8217;s good to hold real&amp;nbsp;assets,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European equities which are exposed to Russia. Whatever the attractions of Russian energy assets are, it&amp;#8217;s going to be decades before Russia is welcomed back into the fold. Currencies prices are hard to manipulate, and it&amp;#8217;s interesting that the Rouble has been strengthening lately. Maybe Russia is coming back already, but I would expect it to take&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Inversion&amp;nbsp;Alert&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my mind, on of the finest free resources on the web is Alex Manzara&amp;#8217;s blog, Chartpoint. 
&lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/inversion-leads-to-submersion/"&gt;Today&amp;#8217;s entry&lt;/a&gt; is all about how the Fed yesterday spooked markets into inverting the 5Y-10Y curve, and generally bending the curve down over out over a couple of years.
The Fed&amp;#8217;s most powerful weapon is signalling. The market&amp;#8217;s is money. 
Not just the &amp;#8220;smart money,&amp;#8221; &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manzara argues that we&amp;#8217;re entering a Dec 2018 scenario. 
It&amp;#8217;s not exactly the same, and the 10Y T-bill future ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZN&lt;/span&gt; on globex) doesn&amp;#8217;t show any indication of rallying yet, but if the recession that is being predicted by the curve inversion comes to pass, surely it&amp;nbsp;will. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not hard to see a few possible triggers. China has rescued its stock market, but western politicians will increasingly be unhappy about the west importing manufactures which are made from cheap Russian primary and intermediate goods (minerals, oil, lumber etc.) when their domestic industries are suffering. The war in Ukraine may go on much longer than anyone expected, and the longer it goes on the more western powers will be drawn in as suppliers of military hardware, food etc. The demands to make Ukraine a no-fly zone are getting shriller by the day. Although nobody wants to start &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WW3&lt;/span&gt;, surely Biden must fancy his chances of victory given all the evidence that Russia is a paper tiger and is on the brink of being defeated by a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; comedian and a rag-tag&amp;nbsp;army. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dictatorships usually have terrible armies. Citizens of Russia are probably happy enough to take what they can get without rocking the boat, because they have no easy alternative. 
When it comes to dying for a corrupt kleptocratic regime, they have other ideas. 
Russia has always suffered from the brightest and the best defecting to the west. 
This, surely, will have increased since the start of the&amp;nbsp;war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I am not a geopolitical commentator, and the event or factor which pushes us in the west into a recession might be anything, or even nothing. Markets are driven by irrational and volatile responses to unimportant events. Keynes&amp;nbsp;wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game of professional investment is intolerably boring and over-exacting to anyone who is entirely exempt from the gambling instinct; whilst he who has it must pay to this propensity the appropriate toll. Furthermore, an investor who proposes to ignore near-term market fluctuations needs greater resources for safety and must not operate on so large a scale, if at all, with borrowed money — a further reason for the higher return from the pastime to a given stock of intelligence and resources. Finally it is the long-term investor, he who most promotes the public interest, who will in practice come in for most criticism, wherever investment funds are managed by committees or boards or banks. For it is in the essence of his behaviour that he should be eccentric, unconventional and rash in the eyes of average opinion. If he is successful, that will only confirm the general belief in his rashness; and if in theshort run he is unsuccessful, which is very likely, he will not receive much&amp;nbsp;mercy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Keynes, John Maynard. The  General Theory  of  Employment, Interest, and Money (p. 96). Kindle&amp;nbsp;Edition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil has swung around 30% in price over the course of a month. It looks as though it&amp;#8217;s going higher again, but this sort of market it seems crazy to try to predict anything, other than that there will be&amp;nbsp;fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Oil volatility" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/NwNq1uPZ/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>The space race</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/the-space-race.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-03-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-03-16T22:05:27+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2022-03-16:/the-space-race.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Wed 16&amp;nbsp;March&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fed Decision&amp;nbsp;Day!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed raised the Federal Funds Rate (which, I think, is also the interest rate on excess reserves) to 50bp.

&lt;h2&gt;Fed Decision&amp;nbsp;Day!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed raised the Federal Funds Rate (which, I think, is also the interest rate on excess reserves) to 50bp. 
This was exactly what the market was expecting. 
The decision was well telegraphed by Powell and others, so no major reaction in the market was&amp;nbsp;triggered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities responded positively. Oil slumped. Gold went up. 
The Dec 22 eurodollar future is trading at 97.74, which implies a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FF&lt;/span&gt; rate of 2.25 by the end of the year, which is not entirely consistent with the Fed median forecast of  1.9% at end 2022, and 2.8% end 2023, according to my limited understanding of these&amp;nbsp;matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AUD&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;  is up about 1%, but this is probably down to reassuring noises coming out of&amp;nbsp;China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Apollo&amp;nbsp;Programme&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was six months old, in 1957, Sputnik 1 was successfully launched into orbit.
This tremendous technological achievement galvanized the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; military industrial complex into action. Three and a half years later, President Kennedy of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; gave a speech to Congress in which he undertook to put a man on the moon and bring him back safely.
Privately, he was not convinced that this was a good idea, but it was what the military wanted, and then as now what the military wants it&amp;nbsp;gets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t know any of this. I do recall the saturation coverage of the Apollo program when I was a kid, and I do recall wondering why we were doing it. Although I was interested in science, I was not interested in science fiction. I wanted to read stuff that was actual science, not fantasy. It seemed to me that we knew a great deal about space from observations from earth, and from unmanned space exploration, and that putting actual men in the very hostile environment of the moon was a huge cost for no obvious differential&amp;nbsp;benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I didn&amp;#8217;t know the figures at the time, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; programme was, at its peak, costing something of the order of 5% of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;. It was obviously costing a lot of money. I think I already had some latent interest in economics, and I felt in my bones that the money could be deployed to better use. In my youth, I was against war, and I had a nagging suspicion that spending more money on arms was simply increasing the likelihood of&amp;nbsp;conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I was not that impressed, I did watch James Burke and Patrick Moore enthusing endlessly about the space missions. 
There was some genuine science coverage in these programmes, and they probably had some influence on me and my contemporaries to study science at a higher level than we would have otherwise. Thinking back, I am pretty sure that the real reason for the existence of the Apollo programme, to get ahead of the Russians in missile technology, was never revealed or discussed. 
The Russians did send up their own rockets, and got to the moon, but using unmanned craft (if I am not mistaken) which were perfectly capable of collecting some moon rock and taking a few photos. As every scientist had predicted, the moon was a dead and deadly dull lump of rock. No commercial benefit was ever likely as a result of travelling there. 
Laughably, it was claimed that the space programme had spinoff benefits outside of military technology, but the only ones people mentioned were Teflon (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PTFE&lt;/span&gt;) for non-stick frying pans (a great innovation in the 60&amp;#8217;s) and ball-point pens that could write upside&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After many years of studying science in university, I ended up working on nuclear power. After I started, I discovered that generating electricity from nuclear power stations like the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; Magnox design was a complete afterthought. The reactors were designed to produce plutonium, a fissile material for bombs. The idea of using them to drive turbines and generate electricity was just a ruse to sell the construction of these things to the general public. Although this is now well known, I still haven&amp;#8217;t seen anything in the mainstream press which explicitly acknowledges this official&amp;nbsp;deceit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big question is whether the space program or the nuclear power program could be sold to the public now as it was when I was growing up. One part of me thinks that reduced control of the mainstream press by the government would make it impossible. I am not so sure. The general population is uncurious about these matters, or maybe you could say that it is rationally ignorant. The common attitude is that whoever is notionally in power, it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter because those who pull the strings (e.g. Klaus Schwab or Rupert Murdoch) remain in control of the levers of power. I don&amp;#8217;t believe this, but I acknowledge that I am less convinced now than I&amp;nbsp;was.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>We’ll miss globalization when it’s gone</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/well-miss-globalization-when-its-gone.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-03-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-03-15T20:55:15+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2022-03-15:/well-miss-globalization-when-its-gone.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Tuesday 15, March&amp;nbsp;2022&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; ran a piece yesterday saying that removing Russia from Most Favoured Nation status in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTO&lt;/span&gt; was not a great idea.

&lt;h2&gt;Globalization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; ran a piece yesterday saying that removing Russia from Most Favoured Nation status in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTO&lt;/span&gt; was not a great idea.
It&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/985915ed-0d0b-4f4b-a7a3-6fcaa95c5d03?desktop=true&amp;amp;segmentId=d8d3e364-5197-20eb-17cf-2437841d178a"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; but it might be behind a paywall.&amp;nbsp;Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article makes (at least) two arguments. One is that Russia mainly exports oil and minerals, which are almost never subject to import tariffs anyway (because developed countries don&amp;#8217;t generally produce much, and because manufacturing can lobby to keep down the cost of its raw materials). It exports some wheat, which is subject to tariffs in developed countries, but it seems mainly to export to poorer ones. The other is that we shouldn&amp;#8217;t use the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTO&lt;/span&gt; as political football, we should fund it properly, and let it do its thing.
We (in the west) should comply with its rules and not try to bypass them by doing stupid stuff like claiming that the manufacturing of biscuits and yoghourts must be protected on grounds of national&amp;nbsp;defence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know about that stuff. I do know that globalization, the shifting of manufacturing jobs to China and other developing nations has had a devastating impact on the working class in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; and the rest of the west.
I know that China has raised many hundreds of millions out of abject rural poverty, but I also know that Brits generally don&amp;#8217;t give a damn, and would like their well-paying, reliable factory jobs back, please, at least in those places far from Westminster where those jobs used to&amp;nbsp;exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; is not very unionized. I&amp;#8217;d guess that it&amp;#8217;s really only the public sector which has a high union membership.
I wouldn&amp;#8217;t be surprised that a quarter of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; workforce was employed in the public sector, and that a similar proportion are unionized. Union power has been fairly muted, apart from a few groups which seem to get special treatment (police, general practitioners, judges, Tube drivers). With employment quite strong now, the &amp;#8216;great resignation (and retirement)&amp;#8217; we may be moving to the stage where the marginal worker is unionized and successful in pushing up his wage. This may leak out into the private sector, especially as the &amp;#8216;living wage&amp;#8217; legislation has, in effect, shrunk the size of the labour force. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NI&lt;/span&gt; rises, of 2.5%, will make it harder for ordinary workers to pay their heating bills, which should make them more&amp;nbsp;militant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, the key will be if the unions in the public sector, especially the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt;, start to push for real-terms pay increases for their members. This will start to establish a benchmark for the rest of the public sector (the teachers, for example, but also the firefighters, police, council workers) which will then raise prices in the less organized private sector. Once a few strikes succeed, and that success is amplified by press coverage, we can see a norm&amp;nbsp;established. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other factor, which is frequently cited, is the fact that the government is in a bind. Through &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt;, it is financing its deficit at the Bank of England discount rate. The fact that 10Y gilts pay 1.5% is irrelevant if the BoE owns them all, and remits the coupon, net of carry, back to the Treasury (which has had to pay the coupon in the first place!). The 2Y gilt yield is around 1.4%. This indicates that the market is very sanguine about&amp;nbsp;inflation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Illumina&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t much comment on individual stocks. There are so many factors which go into pricing equities that it&amp;#8217;s a mugs game to make predictions (&amp;#8220;especially about the future!&amp;#8221;). However, Illumina seem to have some neat, and really new, technology. 
From today&amp;#8217;s Refinitiv morning news&amp;nbsp;call: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genome sequencing group Illumina launched a cancer test in Europe that checks for a wide range of tumour genes in one tissue sample, potentially helping patients with rare diseases to be matched up with treatment options. The test, which Illumina says scans for more mutations than any available kits, comes amid drug industry efforts to develop precision oncology drugs for ever smaller patient groups defined by a genetic profile. This has created pent-up demand for more sophisticated diagnostic tools. Illumina&amp;#8217;s TruSight Oncology Comprehensive test kit scans for 517 cancer-relevant genes across nearly 30 solid tumour types, it said in a statement. Illumina said it was preparing to file for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; regulatory approval for the test kit later this&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I think this is probably a breakthrough, cancer treatment, diagnosis, prevention, and screening are all incredibly difficult, and this may yet fail to prove beneficial in&amp;nbsp;practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nickel and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;ETNs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LME&lt;/span&gt; has retrospectively cancelled nickel futures trades to protect a Chinese billionaire, Xiang Guangda. Doomberg has a good piece on this &lt;a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/nickel-in-front-of-a-steamroller?r=nmbt&amp;amp;s=r&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=web"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. For a futures exchange to retrospectively cancel trades is amazingly serious. Another indication of how bad things are is that Barclays have stopped issuing new units of a volatility &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETN&lt;/span&gt; they used to have as well as a short-term crude futures &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETN&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex Manzara believes this is a big deal (&lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/unpaid-debts-and-turning-points/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).
The point about ETFs and ETNs is that they do financial magic: turning illiquid assets and liabilities into liquid instruments that trade like $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt;. While markets are steady, and not under stress, this works fine. 
But when everyone decides to sell $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPY&lt;/span&gt; at the same time, &lt;em&gt;it will crash the market&lt;/em&gt; There is no other&amp;nbsp;outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fragility comes from everyone investing the same way. Everyone putting their life savings into a tracker, sounds like a good idea, but when the last family office has closed, and nobody trades the underlying stocks, where is the price discovery&amp;nbsp;then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8230;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today stocks bounced, but oil continued to fall.
Most commodities were down, apart from corn and wheat.
The major stories still seem to be the war, and rumours of some sort of talks between Ukraine and Russia about ending the war, and the Covid-induced paralysis in China as it keeps trying its lockdown strategy to contain Omicron.
There is a lot of comment about the Fed interest rate decision which will be announced tomorrow. 
There seems more or less universal consensus that it&amp;#8217;ll be a 25bp rise to 0.5%: the first &amp;#8216;hike&amp;#8217; since 2018. 
Eurodollar futures (near month) moved about 2 bp, the 10Y yield about the&amp;nbsp;same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities have been crazier than usual over the last week.
Heating oil dropped in price by nearly 9% today, a teeny bit more than crude, which dropped 7.8%.
Copper, at $4.48/lb, is just 10% up on a year ago (compared to, e.g. 300% for coal, and 500% for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; gas) and barely changed today (down 0.6%).
The theory that commodities give a unique insight into the real economy seems just wrong.
Prices of oil seem as distorted by short-term speculative money flows as any&amp;nbsp;asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weirdly, the Nasdaq, which has seen such violent moves over the last month, is up a modest 2.3% YoY, about the same as the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DJIA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>War goes on, oil continues to crash</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/war-goes-on-oil-continues-to-crash.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-03-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-03-14T22:01:57+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2022-03-14:/war-goes-on-oil-continues-to-crash.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Monday 14, March&amp;nbsp;2022&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oil and&amp;nbsp;Ukraine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China has been hit by many Omicron outbreaks.

&lt;h2&gt;Oil and&amp;nbsp;Ukraine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China has been hit by many Omicron outbreaks.
It&amp;#8217;s lockdown strategy is failing, but the market is assuming that it will shut down its economy again, 
refusing to consider changing tactics.
The war grinds on. Evidence seems to be mounting that the Russians have bitten off more than they can chew.
The morale and equipment levels of the Russian armed forces seems to be lower than expected, with widespread problems of troop retention 
and ability.
Tactics seem to have changed, with attempts being made to bed in and bomb and besiege Kyiv into a surrender. 
Although Zelenskyy is a puppet of a sort, he&amp;#8217;s risen in his standing to the point when he could become a genuinely popular leader.
Putin seems more and more bunkered, although the picture we are getting now is heavily distorted by the need to support the forces opposed to&amp;nbsp;Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of the market, the slowdown in China is supposedly responsible for another 6% fall in the price of oil.
This will provide some relief from stories about runaway inflation, which is now a headline topic in almost the whole&amp;nbsp;planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity markets fell, alongside bond markets. The narrative is that nominal rates are rising, in a bid to cure inflation.
This doesn&amp;#8217;t make a lot of sense to me, because real rates are still a long way below where they were a year ago.
Oil and many other commodities slumped: coal ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTU&lt;/span&gt;, down 13.5%). Even precious metals are falling, indicating that 
the Fed&amp;#8217;s jawboning and the resurgency of Covid in China will be sufficient to head off&amp;nbsp;inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASDAQ&lt;/span&gt; 100 is now in bear market territory: down 20% from its high. 
The consensus seems to be that stocks are going down and I guess it makes sense to go along with it.
The Russell 2000 still has a P/E of 60, which gives it a long way to fall, in my view. 
The stated P/E is itself misleading, because in computing the index&amp;#8217;s P/E losses are simply ignored.
This, I am assured is in the design of the index, but presumably from a time when it was unusual for stocks
in major indices to make losses year after year.
The big cloud computing names, lockdown winners and meme stocks must be overdue a correction. 
Of course, many stocks are down more than 50%, but the big stocks, particularly the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; have yet to suffer big falls.
Amazon doing a stock split might be the psychological catalyst that tips the index down, rather than the stock up, 
as presumably hoped for by Jeff&amp;nbsp;Bezos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese equities are finally coming down to earth. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MCHI&lt;/span&gt; is down a lot. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHIR&lt;/span&gt; (Chinese real estate) is down a huge amount.
It will be very interesting to find out to what extent China bails out Russia. If it does so, it will face a lost of hostility and potential loss of trade with the west. If it does not do so, Russia will be severely destabilized. If it does do so, it will face a lot of hostility and possible sanctions itself from the West. For my money, China has been a Ponzi scheme for several decades, but 
nobody every made money by betting against a Ponzi until it enters its death&amp;nbsp;throes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big puzzle I have for today is how energy prices are reverting right back to trend, as if inflation has evaporated.
I guess the long-dated Treasury market knew that all&amp;nbsp;along.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Disinformation</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/disinformation.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-03-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-03-11T21:18:55+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2022-03-11:/disinformation.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Friday 11, March&amp;nbsp;2022&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The first casualty of war is the truth.&amp;#8221; 
&amp;#8220;They are not even pretending anymore. &amp;#8212; Ben&amp;nbsp;Hunt&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control of the narrative is very important. 
We all learn that to get our own way, we have to persuade others of the correctness of our thinking.
The easiest way to do this is to present one side of the story.
Presenting one side of the story is a core competence of a politician. 
That&amp;#8217;s why barristers (advocates) do so well as politicians.
Their day job is convince a jury of the correctness of their&amp;nbsp;argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theethicalskeptic.com/?p=63633"&gt;Disinformation vs Misinformation – Neither Has Anything To Do with ‘Intent’ &amp;#8212; &lt;em&gt;The Ethical&amp;nbsp;Skeptic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Will the Ukraine war affect &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; property&amp;nbsp;prices?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know. Nobody does. I&amp;#8217;ll have a&amp;nbsp;stab:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sanctions on their own will not make much difference to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; house prices.  Some top-end properties will have been purchased by oligarchs, but this is a market that is quite distinct from any rental property either of us is likely to&amp;nbsp;own,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;energy price rises will feed into inflation, which ultimately will feed into salaries, which will in turn feed into house prices. In the long term, houses are the ultimate real asset. Interest rates may go up in the short term, though, which might make mortgages less available, which might push house prices&amp;nbsp;down,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the desire to &amp;#8220;re-shore&amp;#8221; production to the west will be a positive for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, which will support house prices (we don&amp;#8217;t import much other than oil from Russia, but generally the exposure to overseas suppliers will be seen as something we want to reduce). Unemployment is already low, compared to the Eurozone, so if we avoid panicking over inflation we should see some wage&amp;nbsp;growth,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the pound will probably go down. Our current account deficit is 3.5%, which puts us between Venezuela and Columbia in the rankings. (And Columbia probably has more exports than are recorded in official statistics!). We&amp;#8217;ve sustained this because we get a lot of foreign direct investment, but that&amp;#8217;s largely stopped because we are now out of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;. If the pound goes down, we will see even more&amp;nbsp;inflation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ordinary people in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; have seen stocks (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTSE&lt;/span&gt;) go nowhere in a decade. They do not trust fund managers. They get a modest yield on a house, and this is something the value of which cannot go to zero just because some stock exchange is subject to sanctions. All ownership is contingent on the government not seizing the asset, but a democratic government would have difficulty seizing houses. Crypto currencies (held on an exchange, which is where the vast bulk of them are), on the other hand, are really quite vulnerable: see &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/fintech/russia-crypto-sanctions"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;banks continue to be happy to lend to finance residential property. In fact, I think that over 80% of all bank lending is linked to&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​Having said all this, nothing is certain, and you should do your own research.&amp;nbsp;​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Monopoly and&amp;nbsp;monopsony&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that a market where there is a lot of competitive suppliers and consumers is the best way to allocate resources to maximize overall consumer welfare. In the jargon of economists, a free market leads to Pareto Efficiency. That&amp;#8217;s why I am against price fixing, whether it&amp;#8217;s in the price of milk, money (i.e. interest rates), pencils or labour. To prove the Pareto Efficiency, there are a number of other assumptions, including neglible transaction costs. I am not an economist: look it&amp;nbsp;up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But many markets lack many of the attributes which characterize a truly free market. 
Read any book on business strategy (my favourite is &lt;em&gt;Competition Demystified: A Radically Simplified Approach to Business Strategy&lt;/em&gt; by Bruce C. Greenwald and Judd Kahn) and you will find that businesses are tireless in striving to keep out of markets which are truly competitive. 
When business arrange themselves to stifle competition, the remedy is supposed to be the law.
Developed economies have laws which are supposed to protect consumers from exploitation by businesses which 
combine in such a way to eliminate competition.
Unfortunately, politics today depends heavily on campaign contributions from those very firms that should be regulated. 
The result is a steady weakening of competition law, especially in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;, but (I suspect) throughout the developed world. 
Matt Stoller has written extensively on this. 
He has just written a new piece which focusses on employers combining to reduce competition for workers.
Historically, &amp;#8220;company towns&amp;#8221; saw factory workers exploited during the Industrial Revolution.
Unfortunately, for certain types of jobs, this is still a problem&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always instinctively been against minimum wage laws. For a start, they are mis-named. 
If truly every worker was guaranteed the minimum wage, assuming this did not drive employers out of business, this would not be too bad.
But for the marginal worker, the last guy who can be added to the workforce such that he allows the value of total output to go up (his marginal product) in excess of the wage that he is paid, when a minimum wage is increased, or introduced, and it is above his marginal product, his employer will terminate his employment,
in the classical&amp;nbsp;analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if the employer is a monopsonist, this will not be the case. 
There seems to be evidence that this is what is happening in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;.
I am still sceptical that this will apply everywhere, and a minimum wage will really have no impact on employment, but I accept that the effect is quite small, in practice, for the current &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; minimum wage&amp;nbsp;level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, clearly the better approach would be to be more vigorous in busting the cartels.

&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; forecast to rise 10% YoY. 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; 10Y gilts yield now at ~1.5%, up 67bp YoY. Not exactly Venezuela, but probably worrying for the BoE, given that Germany&amp;#8217;s equivalent yield is only 24bp.
Generally, today was risk off. Equities were down, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; bond yields were up (fractionally), dollar was up (against almost everything). Commodities were generally down, apart from oil and wheat, which had&amp;nbsp;overshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WFH&lt;/span&gt; winners were fading strongly. Docusign was down 20% on weak results. Zoom, Peleton, Meta are all looking pretty sick. 
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPAC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPAK&lt;/span&gt;, is not available to short.

&lt;p&gt;Biden, his advisors, Kamala, the Twitter amanuensis, whoever it is that writes Biden&amp;#8217;s tweets is clueless about energy. 
He uses the usual argument that it&amp;#8217;s cheaper to use renewable energy, and so not using oil will save us money and benefit us in other ways. 
But this simply isn&amp;#8217;t true. The market has a fabulous track record in delivering the goods in the cheapest possible way, and for the moment fossil fuels is that way. 
We cannot wish away that&amp;nbsp;fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Loosening environmental regulations won’t lower prices. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But transforming our economy to run on electric vehicles, powered by clean energy, will mean that no one will have to worry about gas prices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It will mean tyrants like Putin won’t be able to use fossil fuels as a&amp;nbsp;weapon.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; President Biden (@&lt;span class="caps"&gt;POTUS&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1501365906227793922?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 9, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world divides into Fotherington-Tomases and Nigels. 
The former treat climate change as a quasi-religious matter, the latter as a scientific one.
Because religion is a much better rallying cry for politicians than science, the political class is in the
Fotherington-Tomas camp.
It is very unclear how this will play out, but my guess is that it will not pan out&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil continued to sink, stocks too, which is a reversal. Commodities were very mixed, with food up along with precious metals, but energy down, apart from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt;.
The dollar is up again, following 10Y yields, which again are in touching distance of&amp;nbsp;2%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putin seems to have said that he&amp;#8217;ll continue supplying oil (why wouldn&amp;#8217;t he??), the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UAE&lt;/span&gt; is still trying to talk up &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OPEC&lt;/span&gt; output, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; initial jobless claims were a bit above expectation (227K vs 217K). Maybe it was this that pushed stocks back down vs&amp;nbsp;yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess is that something has to give. Russia&amp;#8217;s interest rates are now 20%.

A few things happened: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UAE&lt;/span&gt; suggested that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OPEC&lt;/span&gt; would sell more oil, Zelenskyy said he&amp;#8217;d talk to the Russians,
people seem to have decided that the Fed and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt; will hike less, or later than they were thinking earlier, and Sweden said that it would definitely not apply to join &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NATO&lt;/span&gt;. These did not seem like game changers, even in aggregate. 
But oil fell $15 a barrel! Oil dragged virtually every other commodity down with it (e.g. heating oil fell 22%).
Stocks exploded. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, 20% for Moscow wasn&amp;#8217;t that much, in the context of recent falls. But nearly 8% for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DAX&lt;/span&gt; seems&amp;nbsp;excessive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess is that the most probable move tomorrow will reverse all this, but with a nearly equal probability of the move continuing. Volatility is so high nothing would surprise me, including everything remaining totally&amp;nbsp;unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the markets were risk on, the dollar ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt;) dropped back, to under 98, and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EUR&lt;/span&gt; shot up,&amp;nbsp;$1.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Ukraine itself, people continue to die, but it seems as though the world has moved on, has assumed that Russia will win, and Ukraine will become like Crimea before it: a Russian client&amp;nbsp;oblast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a longer view, I suspect that fears of inflation are overdone.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury ten-year yield is still below 2%, which represents a huge numbers of portfolio managers betting with their bonuses that inflation is not going to get out of hand.
A week&amp;#8217;s spike in some commodities that are traded with huge leverage is not a sustained bull market.
However, with headline prints heading for 9 or 10%, central banks could still screw things up and throw us into a recession. 
That will definitely cut inflation off at the&amp;nbsp;knees.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Equities start to hurt</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/equities-start-to-hurt.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-03-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-03-08T09:36:40+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2022-03-07:/equities-start-to-hurt.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Monday  7, March&amp;nbsp;2022&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine is going on too long.
The west has badly miscalculated Putin&amp;#8217;s intentions, and it&amp;#8217;s not clear what credible threats now will deter him from driving on until he&amp;#8217;s conquered Ukraine.
Economically, having Ukraine once more fall within Russia&amp;#8217;s orbit would not greatly harm the west.
The place is a cesspit of corruption, and has historic and linguistic as well as criminal links to Russia.
However, popular feeling now is that plucky little Vlododymyr Zelenskyy can&amp;#8217;t end up in a Siberian gulag, tortured for the rest of his (shortened)&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other problem is that the war is exploding commodity prices, especially energy, which makes up so much of the consumer basket of prices, which means that central banks cannot easily step back from promised rate hikes without losing credibility. Most central bankers have been bleeding credibility for some while (remember Carney, the &amp;#8220;unreliable boyfriend&amp;#8221;?). If they blink now and do not tighten, they will totally lose their main weapon, which is the ability to talk the market down or up. One wonders why Powell went for a second term, but hubris always comes before&amp;nbsp;nemesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, the consequence is that yield curves are flattening all around, in other words, markets are pricing in a recession.
Well, I guess that&amp;#8217;ll fix&amp;nbsp;inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s anyone&amp;#8217;s guess what will end up happening. My instinct is that, fundamentally, central banks are not independent, and that they are subject to political control, and so we will not see much more tightening, and we&amp;#8217;ll get stagflation rather than a short sharp&amp;nbsp;shock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of market action, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; is sharply down, by 3%, with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; down 3.8%. 
Bonds are up slightly, but not much.
The dollar (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt;) is up a lot: over 99.
Commodities continue skywards: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTI&lt;/span&gt; near month is now kissing $120/barrel. 
Gold is finally starting to get bid. It&amp;#8217;s now at $1997, up 1.5%. Unlike &amp;#8220;digital gold,&amp;#8221; aka Bitcoin, which 
has turned out to be just proxy for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>SWIFTian prose</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/swiftian-prose.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-03-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-03-04T16:28:38+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2022-03-04:/swiftian-prose.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Friday  4, March&amp;nbsp;2022&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Moving money&amp;nbsp;internationally&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bam.kalzumeus.com/archive/moving-money-internationally/"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is an insanely good essay on what it means to move money internationally, 
by someone who really understands what money is.
You need to read it (H/T to Matt Levine who mentioned it in &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-03-03/uninvestable-markets-are-hard-to-trade"&gt;today&amp;#8217;s column&lt;/a&gt;). 
What Patrick McKenzie points out is that your money is just a record of what someone (your debtor) owes you: an asset on your balance sheet, a credit on the balance sheet of your debtor.
That someone has to be pretty credit-worthy, which is why it&amp;#8217;s a bank. Or maybe the central bank (in effect, when you have a ten pound note). 
It doesn&amp;#8217;t work as money unless more or less anyone is willing to accept the credit.
So, most Brits trust &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; banks, and so a current account works great as money, for a transferee who is in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;.
But to pay someone overseas, somehow, that debt has to be safely converted to an obligation that your payee&amp;nbsp;trusts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currencies are just obligations of central banks. There are as many currencies as there are central banks.
Peripheral banks bank with the central bank, just like you bank with the peripheral bank.
But, they also bank with overseas banks &amp;#8220;correspondent banks,&amp;#8221; to allow international funds&amp;nbsp;transfer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, McKenzie&amp;#8217;s essay is wonderful, because it explains how &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SWIFT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s role is nothing to do with its technology, 
and all to do with established custom, &amp;#8220;consensual fictions&amp;#8221; as he calls it. 
He points out that political policy ends up being implemented, rigorously but arbitrarily, in an environment where nobody actually is accountable.
In Russia, and in China, people are denied access to services that would normally taken for granted, without any recourse or protection.
The consensual fiction that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SWIFT&lt;/span&gt; is a Belgian co-operative allows the targetting of bad people. 
The problem is that it can end up targetting good people, without those people having any&amp;nbsp;redress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In society, we know that there are some bad actors who we just can&amp;#8217;t prosecute because we don&amp;#8217;t have the evidence.
If we just say &amp;#8220;Oh, everyone knows that guy is a bad actor, let&amp;#8217;s put him in prison where he can&amp;#8217;t do any more harm,&amp;#8221; we could well end up like Russia.
In places like Singapore, one can be bankrupted by the state using libel laws, if you speak out against the People&amp;#8217;s Action Party.
The population mainly don&amp;#8217;t protest. But a lot of them want to move to a democratic country. People value&amp;nbsp;freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTW&lt;/span&gt;, Matt Levine is an amazing writer. It&amp;#8217;s insane that his newsletter is free. I guess his cost is written down as a marketing cost for Bloomberg; 
his value to Bloomberg must be many times his cost. If only the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; could have such great&amp;nbsp;content!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Moscow-on-Thames&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian emigrés are a feature of London life, and have been for over a century.
Many, I am sure, are utterly honest and law-abiding people.
But a certain percentage are mafia bosses. 
One can know this from various sources, and certainly the odd op-ed in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; discusses 
the implications of this situation.
Magazines like The Economist acknowledge the problem too, as in 
&lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/03/05/the-rise-and-fall-of-londongrad"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;.
My suspicion, though, is that the proletariat is blissfully unaware of what&amp;#8217;s going on 
in Belgravia, and that the political class would prefer to keep it that way.
Clearly, the Conservative Party receives quite a bit of its funding from these people,
but I would not be surprised if this applied to the other parties too, 
and that Russia (and China) couldn&amp;#8217;t care less about the ideology of the party they are funneling funds to,
as long as that party (i) wields political influence and (ii) understands that if policies are enacted to harm
the interest of the donors that the consequence will be diversion of this support to the opposition&amp;nbsp;party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that oligarchs care deeply about is cloaking of ultimate beneficial ownership. 
As Private Eye regularly reports, the various &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; Companies Houses makes it very easy to conceal this,
as do the various crown dominions, such as the Channel Islands and the Caymann Islands.
Every so often, one glimpses the scale of this sort of activity.
One recent example is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suisse_secrets"&gt;Suisse Secrets&lt;/a&gt;, where 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHF&lt;/span&gt; 100bn of funds were identified as belonging to kleptocrats and similar compromised individuals.
Somehow, governments never seem very motivated to act to return this money to 
those whose money this rightfully is. I wonder if it has anything to do with the sorts of people who make use of these
facilities, such as Tony Blair who was revealed to have bought a London property from a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UAE&lt;/span&gt; sheik in the Pandora Papers.
To be fair, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-58780559"&gt;the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt; did report this one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Banks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are a mystery to most people.
They read a lot about them, and about central banks, they are told they are very important, and they know that they are subject to a lot of regulation,
but they are hazy on the hows and whys of the&amp;nbsp;institution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is that the jargon used to describe the components of a bank&amp;#8217;s balance sheet is almost intentionally confusing.
What is referred to as equity for any other type of company is referred to as &amp;#8220;capital.&amp;#8221; 
Banks have to be very creditworthy, so they are subject to numerous regulations about how much capital they most&amp;nbsp;hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Russian&amp;nbsp;equities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, Russian equities are going to become tradeable again, and those who hold them are going to make a lot of money.
When you buy a stock, you go short cash (rouble) and long the stock (a real asset, maybe oil or similar here).
This seems a very good idea in Russia now.
On a mark-to-market basis, these things may appear to be worthless, but that&amp;#8217;s only because people are locked out of buying.
At some point, people will want oil, and will pay a lot for it (especially in terms of roubles).
This is not advice, but even if it was, you wouldn&amp;#8217;t be able to follow it because no broker can sell you Russian equities&amp;nbsp;anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reflexivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People seem to be addicted&amp;nbsp;to &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Currencies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPY&lt;/span&gt; looks a sell here:

&lt;p&gt;Energy and commodities continued to escalate in price. 
Coal (Rotterdam Coal Futures, near month) was up&amp;nbsp;38%!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank of Canada, and the Fed, and Biden, and just about all politicians, are panicking about inflation.
It&amp;#8217;s a serious problem, but doing a Volker is likely to make things worse (arguably, as the great man himself&amp;nbsp;did).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what the major players are doing, but my guess is that they are in risk-off mode and moving to short duration assets, 
even cash. Although some risk assets (commodities) seem to be doing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; at the moment, I feel that as soon as there is hint that Ukraine will
be resolved a lot of prices will&amp;nbsp;revert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkish inflation hit 54% YoY in Feb. It&amp;#8217;s hard to see how the Turkish Lira can avoid collapsing.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TRY&lt;/span&gt; rate has been remarkably stable over the last month, and maybe nobody wants to take on risk right now,

&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only story in town is of oil becoming unanchored. The near month went up by nearly $8 a barrel. 
This is a commodity which was trading at a negative price a couple of years ago.
The world seems to be waking up to the fact that (i) it needs a lot of oil to keep the show on the road, (ii) quite a lot of oil comes from Russia and it&amp;#8217;s going to get harder for the west to import it and (iii), &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OPEC&lt;/span&gt;+ includes Russia, and they quite like the price of oil to go up and (iv) politically, in the west, it&amp;#8217;s very difficult for governments to open up new sources of oil by auctioning exploration licenses, approving pipelines etc. and (v) a lot of millenials will avoid mutual funds etc. which include oil&amp;nbsp;companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Near month, continuous, CL" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/WRK1D681/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing is that the whole forward curve is moving up. Previously, there were major moves in the near months, but much more muted moves in the more distant ones (as well as a complete evaporation of liquidity beyond a couple of years). Now it seems that cash is being pulled into energy commodities, which has resulted in increased liquidity at the long&amp;nbsp;end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market may be over extended. Putin might decide to pack up and go home. Russia might be welcomed back into the international community. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OPEC&lt;/span&gt; might reverse today&amp;#8217;s decision to stabilize production at current levels. But the odds are against it.
Does this mean that a ~8% jump in the price of oil is an accurate assessment of overnight change in the supply and demand schedules for oil? Probably not, 
but for the moment nobody is going to dare short oil, so it could well go&amp;nbsp;higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powell had his regular Congressional testimony today. For once, this wasn&amp;#8217;t the main headline in financial news. He seems to have said that he plans to hike, on 15th March, but he will only do 25bp, and Ukraine makes it more likely that he&amp;#8217;ll pedal back on the four hikes promise. Equity markets were up, which is at least consistent with that. Bonds were down too, again pointing to a risk-off event, even though higher oil is surely contractionary. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZROZ&lt;/span&gt; (the 25+ year &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PIMCO&lt;/span&gt; zero-coupon &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt;) was down&amp;nbsp;4.9%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Macro&amp;nbsp;Alf&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoy listening to Emil Kalinowski and Jeff Snider talking about the Eurodollar market and its derivatives, &lt;a href="https://player.fm/series/eurodollar-university"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
They had a departure from the norm recently, in the form of an interview with Macro Alf himself. 
Alf explained how &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; had caused huge problems for banks in the Eurozone as it had destroyed the carry trade and had failed to induce banks to lend to productive activity. The fact is that we&amp;#8217;ve created a lot of physical capital, and the marginal rate of return on investment had been forced down a long way, which is the ultimate determinant of real interest rates. Because banks can&amp;#8217;t lend, because there is nobody safe to lend to, they are left stuffed full of reserves which, in Europe at least, don&amp;#8217;t even pay any interest. In some sense, rates are the mirror image of prices. As real interest rates become ever more negative, it makes sense for stock prices to become ever higher. Can this go on forever? One feels that it can&amp;#8217;t, but maybe in this case they can. The redistributive effects may eventually provoke a political crisis, which might be the start of the end. We&amp;#8217;re not there yet, but we&amp;#8217;re getting&amp;nbsp;closer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil prices have gone up 76% YoY, 22% MoM and 15% in the last week. 
So far oil stocks and longer-dated contracts have not moved nearly so much,
but inflation expectations are now so entrenched (in my view) that it will be a while before
we see the price being driven down.
Virtually every commodity is in an established upward trend. 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TTF&lt;/span&gt; gas has gone up 700% YoY and is still rising.
Coal has gone up&amp;nbsp;244%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; has had two months running in which it has &amp;#8220;lost ground.&amp;#8221; We may be seeing a secular&amp;nbsp;shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The driver of all this is a shortage of minerals caused by Russia being excluded from world trade links.
It will be interesting to see how China reacts to this. 
For the moment, it will probably be content to buy cheap Russian oil and gas, but for how long can the west tolerate
this sort of behaviour. We all know that Xi and Putin are autocratic thugs, but diplomats are not supposed to say that out&amp;nbsp;loud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="OER and Zillow market rent diverge massively" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/inflation_rent.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The&amp;nbsp;1920s&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been listening to Murray Rothbard&amp;#8217;s lectures on the 20th Century American Economic History.
Rothbard is regarded as a somewhat fringe figure by the economics profession, possibly because of the very low opinion 
in which he held most of the leading practitioners of his time and earlier.
He is an entertaining lecturer, though, and his lectures can be downloaded as a series of podcasts.
I was listening to his account of how the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; came to return to the gold standard at its pre-war parity in 1921, and 
how via the League of Nations, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; impoverished the Balkan states by making them link their currencies to stirling. 
What is interesting is the extent to which bankers and industrialists were closely involved in setting monetary policy 
even back in the&amp;nbsp;1920s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My conclusion, from listening to these lectures, is that monetary policy cannot actually prevent the economic damage that 
results from the operation of the business cycle, but it can redistribute the pain between classes.
Rothbard has a fairly hard-line Misean world view, but his account of the history is largely a factual one, as far as I can&amp;nbsp;tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He makes many points, but the one that I think is relevant today is that there is a natural tendency in any developed economy towards
deflation. For a given set of factors of production, advances in technique and knowledge will allow the same quantity of consumer goods
available at ever decreasing real cost. 
He would certainly decry the current governors of central&amp;nbsp;banks.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Ukraine: day 5</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/ukraine-day-5.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-02-28T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-02-28T21:50:30+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2022-02-28:/ukraine-day-5.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Monday 28, February&amp;nbsp;2022&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been away, and much too busy with my day job to think much about what&amp;#8217;s happening.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been away, and much too busy with my day job to think much about what&amp;#8217;s happening.
We are still in the fog of war, and nobody knows that the outcome will be, but the following things might be worth thinking&amp;nbsp;about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia is economically puny. It&amp;#8217;s only two thirds the size of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. Ukraine is way down there between Morocco and Sudan. Whatever happens, it&amp;#8217;s hard to see that the global economy will be destabilized, unless there is contagion across the&amp;nbsp;region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SWIFT&lt;/span&gt; is just a messaging system. Fax machines offer an alternative system. 
It&amp;#8217;s hard to believe that the Russians will not work out how to sell their oil and gas to &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; who can pay them in stuff they&amp;nbsp;want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe has changed its attitude. Germany particularly. It may actually start to behave more like a country, not it perceives a threat from a nuclear-armed near neighbour. Politicians may be forced to not only speak, but act&amp;nbsp;decisively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In war, as in pandemics, governments tend to spend, and not dither endlessly worrying about how to reduce the deficit. This is usually good for distribution of income to the strata in society who have a high propensity to consume. This may result in the long-discussed but rarely seen levelling up and economic&amp;nbsp;recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visible need to accept Ukrainians as refugees may make aging societies like Britain and Germany be more welcoming to immigration in general, with a possible lift to&amp;nbsp;inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The markets seem to be waiting for some certainty.
Predictably, commodities have bounced violently. 
Coal is up 15%, wheat by 9%. The large violent downward moves of last week will have stopped out a lot of investors.
Predictable rally in dollars, and lowering of yields. 
The general rush to safe assets has continued, but feels as though it&amp;#8217;s petering out.
This is a day to sit on the sidelines, watching, with a beer in&amp;nbsp;hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRNT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRNT&lt;/span&gt; dropped 23% after a White Diamond short-seller report. 
Good for White Diamond, but with low liquidity most retail investors will not have made money. The guys certainly seem to know what they are talking about, &lt;a href="https://whitediamondresearch.com/research/ironnet-the-doomed-cybersecurity-company-50c-price-target/"&gt;as you can see&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Social Credit and&amp;nbsp;Money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Levine is the most amazingly original thinker.
I don&amp;#8217;t know how he comes up with his stuff.
Even if he was a team of ten, I&amp;#8217;d still be impressed.
He points out that if you work hard and make stuff that people want, 
you get money, and that allows you to fly and stuff.
Just like China&amp;#8217;s Social Credit.
He goes on to say that all money is like a social credit, 
because it relies of tacit acceptance of society to make it function.
He made this point in the context of Russia not be able to use its vast

&lt;h2&gt;“The Decade the Rich&amp;nbsp;Won”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt; has a new two-part documentary about the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis. 
It&amp;#8217;s worth watching, but I feel it misses the point.
The conventional wisdom is that governments manage the economy.
The narrative is crafted to make people believe that without active intervention by an omniscient chancellor, the economy will grind to a halt.
The reality is, of course, totally different, but it does not suit any politician to tell the truth.
Governments love to talk about spending money, supporting industry, the poor, the dispossessed, jobs, high-tech industry, training etc. etc.
But what they really do is transfer real resources from one group to another, from one individual to another.
Political parties need to be elected, and for that they need to control the narrative.
To control the narrative, they need resources, the support of powerful men.
It is no coincidence that Jeff Bezos decided to buy a newspaper, and to build a streaming behemoth.
Politicians have learned that whatever they do, they must retain the support of the elite.
Most left-wing commentators put this down to some sort of secret deal between politicians and the rich.
I feel this may be a teleological fallacy. I rather think that any party that does not do this instinctively has simply become extinct 
through the normal operation of politics, whether democratic or otherwise.
Maybe I&amp;#8217;m too cynical, but what is clear to me, and probably to anyone who watches the documentary, is that Labour would not have done anything very different to the 
coalition government of&amp;nbsp;2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History is nice, because no hypothesis can be disproved.

&lt;h2&gt;Ukraine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia seems to have decided on a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 
Markets reacted strongly this morning, with near-dated Brent futures shooting up a huge amount.
Various &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; and other countries condemned Russia, but at the end of the day, 
Russia is not going to be locked out of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SWIFT&lt;/span&gt; and is unlikely to suffer any really damaging sanctions.
Nord Stream 2 is paused, but it seems to me that eventually the west will accept what Russia has done
(just as it did in 2014 with regard to Crimea) and we will return to&amp;nbsp;normality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock markets outside of Russia did fairly well, with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASDAQ&lt;/span&gt; shooting up by 3%, 
presumably on the basis that Biden will not take any decisive action which might increase
gasoline prices, and the Fed will use the war as an excuse to delay rate increases and &amp;#8220;quantitative tightening&amp;#8221;.
The market really does believe in the &amp;#8220;Fed&amp;nbsp;put&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEC&lt;/span&gt; has started action against Elon Musk and his brother for insider trading. The stock went&amp;nbsp;up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most dramatic change today was the &amp;#8220;flattening&amp;#8221; of the oil futures curve: the short-dated contracts zoomed up, but the longer-dated ones were much less&amp;nbsp;affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds were relaxed about everything: the 10Y yield changed by 3 bp! I guess this is the cancelling effects of inflation expectations and a flight to safe&amp;nbsp;assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors continue to be concerned that Fed tightening will stifle growth in the world&amp;#8217;s largest economy. Fed&amp;#8217;s Mester said a rate hike in March is still reasonable, barring an unforeseen shift, while Fed&amp;#8217;s Bostic said he&amp;#8217;s open to four or more rate hikes, depending on the data. The Fed&amp;#8217;s projections for six quarter-point rises this year are in line with what was factored in before the Ukraine&amp;nbsp;attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

They went through their argument that J Powell really is the Wizard of Oz and that he has no power except 
to the extent that he can influence expectations.

&lt;p&gt;Expectations, aggregate demand above productive capacity, runaway growth in credit creation. There are many explanations of inflation, most of which seem to fail in one regime or&amp;nbsp;another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a very long time since anyone in fixed income markets in developed markets had any first hand experience of inflation, and how to trade in a bear&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflation and weakening of the currency, and rising yields of government debt, often linked to a falling currency are often&amp;nbsp;linked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sure is hard to come up with a reliable, quantitative model for inflation, so hats off to &lt;a href="https://arkesresearch.substack.com/p/eu-inflation-update-013?utm_source=url"&gt;Arkes Research&lt;/a&gt;
for coming up with one.
It forecasts 3.7% for 2022, vs 3.2% from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt; economists.
How much faith to put in either of these numbers is impossible to say, 
but it seems clear that commodities are going to continue to&amp;nbsp;rally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; seems determined to force Germany to cancel Nord Stream 2. 
Russia will be subject to sanctions for what it has done so far.
Intelligence suggests that Russian troops will soon go into the disputed reasons, on the pretext of protecting Russian speakers from Ukrainian&amp;nbsp;aggression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOMC&lt;/span&gt; member Daly has said that he wants to see four rate hikes (100bp,&amp;nbsp;presumably).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has declared a state of&amp;nbsp;emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly all equity markets have gone done.
Oddly, nearly all govt. bond prices have gone up (yields down).
Today, the safe-haven properties of bonds were outweighed by the inflation sensitivity.
Treasuries and some currencies (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AUD&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPY&lt;/span&gt;) have started to have a risk-on behaviour which is not&amp;nbsp;typical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a day for being flat, which &amp;#8212; after all &amp;#8212; is a position&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conspiracy&amp;nbsp;Corner&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thehighersidechats.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-the-real-anthony-fauci-aids-covid-the-medical-industrial-complex/"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr. | The Real Anthony Fauci, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COVID&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; The Medical Industrial&amp;nbsp;Complex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big Pharma is a pretty toxic entity. The capture of regulators is endemic in most developed markets, but particularly in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not know if Fauci is guilty of what he is accused of doing, but this episode is worth listening to, if only to understand what all the Joe Rogan fans are on&amp;nbsp;about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basis thesis is that Fauci allowed big pharma to corrupt the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CDC&lt;/span&gt; and other medical regulators in a way that allowed them make big profits from inferior&amp;nbsp;treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was unaware of the claims, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/dec/2/publisher-blasts-total-media-blackout-robert-kenne/"&gt;unsurprisingly&lt;/a&gt;. Kennedy is mentioned in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;, but only in stories about decisions to ban him.

&lt;h2&gt;Credit markets&amp;nbsp;drooping&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are going into a bear market in equities, I&amp;#8217;d expect to see credit markets weakening first.
Bond traders are constitutionally bearish, and see the clouds on the horizon first, in my not-very-data-driven opinion.
A graphic from the Daily Shot illustrates this for last week. It&amp;#8217;s not uniform: emerging markets (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt;) high yield, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; sovereign debt did pretty well.
Preferreds ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PFF&lt;/span&gt;) and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HY&lt;/span&gt; corporates ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HYG&lt;/span&gt;) did &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, up around 0.3%. However, mortgage backed securities (including collateralized ones), as well as BCDs ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIZD&lt;/span&gt;) and leveraged loans ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BKLN&lt;/span&gt;), all&amp;nbsp;sagged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was interesting to me was how much investment grade corporate bonds ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LQD&lt;/span&gt;) suffered. They were down nearly 1%, which to me suggests some margin&amp;nbsp;stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Credit market movements, week to 18th Feb 2022" src="https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/aqN3lT0Ah2D99fi258FxM-gZE6j-2_e1ehcX-2HZQ_oLs6IcN99FGAWohpnU6aCz8BrxtC7sd0I3LHgSPjmPhuf-KZRXgOd451uGDfW2FTL8_NkLkyCi=s0-d-e1-ft#https://thedailyshot.com/wp-content/uploads/CR-Returns2202210532.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are not big moves. 
All these are in some way correlated to the stock market. 
Maybe it&amp;#8217;s just a contagion effect, with the variation accounted for by beta&amp;nbsp;values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like Putin politely waited for the Winter Olympics in Beijing to finish before taking over parts of Ukraine, including some (all?) of Luhansk and Donetsk.
Russian equities took a dive, dragging down the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STOXX&lt;/span&gt; 600. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; rattled a few&amp;nbsp;sabres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds strengthened, dragged up by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasuy futures. 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; markets were closed for a public&amp;nbsp;holiday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOMC&lt;/span&gt; members (well, Bowman, anyway) said that a &amp;#8216;hike&amp;#8217; was needed in March. Ukraine will be the perfect excuse for delay. I can&amp;#8217;t see 50bp on the cards&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil (near dated futures) shot up. Long dated futures drifted down.

Most stock holdings are passive now, which means that buying and selling is driven by random allocations by final investors, 
not highly paid analysts who know a bubble when they see one.
Knowledge diffuses slowly, but after six weeks of declining prices, more and more end-investors are going to hear that

&lt;h2&gt;War&amp;nbsp;games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putin seems to be running rings around the west in relation to his strategy for Ukraine.
I have no idea what&amp;#8217;s going to happen, but markets got spooked.
There were reports of shelling in Ukraine.
Conspiracy theories swirl around: one that I have heard repeated is that a &amp;#8220;false flag&amp;#8221; attack on Russia will be arranged, 
which will be used by Russia as an excuse to attack and occupy the Ukraine, or at least parts of&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that Russia is a kleptocracy from which all citizens with any luggage will attempt to escape. 
The grim reality of living in a country in steep decline means that as the population shrinks, more people will want to escape, 
especially the young. 
Putin will get older and more rigid in his policies. His lieutenants will become more powerful and more greedy, draining more and more of 
the country&amp;#8217;s wealth into Londongrad and similar hard-money economies. (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, you can argue that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBP&lt;/span&gt; is probably not the hardest currency in the world, 
but it has a rule of law and there will always be a welcome from Swiss private banks for the oligarch&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;cash).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am signed up to the free tier of &lt;a href="https://collective.macro-ops.com/"&gt;Macro Ops&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://termbin.com/7yvh"&gt;This note&lt;/a&gt;, sent to me via email, but not accessible from the website seemed outstanding. Note that the scraped text of the email will go after a month, and the link in the previous sentence will stop working.&amp;nbsp;Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oil and the&amp;nbsp;Fed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My (amateur) take on headlines I read from a speech by Governor Williams of the Fed was that they are 
striving to sound dovish, in order not to spook the markets.
The idea is that they will not actively tighten, but let the balance sheet &amp;#8220;run off.&amp;#8221;
I don&amp;#8217;t know the maturity breakdown of the Fed&amp;#8217;s balance sheet. If it is evenly divided by maturity, 
allowing the existing positions to redeem will keep the mix largely unchanged except for some shortening 
at the long end as new long bonds will no longer be purchased.
Does this make any difference to anyone? I doubt&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Williams seems to think that the Fed has everything under control, and that inflation will glide down towards the target rate.
I&amp;#8217;ve read a lot of smart commentators who think that the idea that the Fed can unwind a $9e12 position without crashing

&lt;h2&gt;Doomberg &amp;#8220;Just Watch&amp;nbsp;Me&amp;#8221;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not Canadian.
I don&amp;#8217;t really know what the truckers in the Canadian convoy were protesting against.
But I do believe in the right to protest, and I do believe that those opposed to vaccine mandates have a right to be&amp;nbsp;heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also in favour of governments making an informed tradeoff between risks and costs.
We consent to give up a lot of freedom when we live in society.
We have really no option but to consent to be constrained by decisions made by our forefathers. 
We have to believe that they acted in good faith in creating the rules, and the rules about how rules are made, and bend our behaviour to avoid breaking these rules.
Or at least accepting the penalties laid down for the breaking of these&amp;nbsp;rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these rules become ever more onerous. Our every movement, our every minor purchase are now subject to potential oversight.
Our every communication is likely to be taken down and used against us.
We now cannot easily change our nationality or place of abode, something that was trivially achieved a few generations ago.
We are turning into a surveillance state, not unlike the German Democratic&amp;nbsp;Republic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans like rules, predictability, routine and figures of authority.
These things emerge as phenomena in almost all societies beyond a few families.
Maybe our deep-rooted desire for these things stems from a time when we all lived 
in extended family groups. Whatever the evolutionary or other explanation, this is where we tend to head, as a&amp;nbsp;society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, when societies develop like this, they encourage rent seeking and exploitation. 
I am not even sure that it is power that corrupts. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s more that power seeks out those who are most corruptible and&amp;nbsp;sociopathic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe things are all fine, really, and the steady encroachment of the state on our civil rights is a trade-off we would choose, even if we were conscious of it, and and our attention drawn to the risks and the historical precedents. 
But, to my knowledge, nobody has presented the argument this way.
We are always presented with a &lt;em&gt;fait accompli&lt;/em&gt; in which we are told that we have to sacrifice our freedom in exchange for keeping people&amp;nbsp;safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, all risk to planes worldwide had to be driven to zero regardless of the impact on people’s time or freedom. Zero is an emotional number and an impossible task, but a remarkably effective target when garnering public support for&amp;nbsp;compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, fear is a powerful tool of propaganda. A surprisingly high number of people are willing to forgo even basic rights in exchange for perceived protection from the state, no matter how small the increment of protection is on offer. 
a false dichotomy between perfect safety and a minor loss of&amp;nbsp;freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#8217;s nothing. Maybe we are on a slippery&amp;nbsp;slope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is extreme uncertainty about Russia&amp;#8217;s intentions towards Ukraine.
Sovereign bond yields continue to fall, as equities and risk-on currencies like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BRL&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AUD&lt;/span&gt; fall in price vs &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPY&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHF&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities fell, as a natural reaction to a strengthening dollar with the exception of risk-off items like gold and silver and a few&amp;nbsp;softs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of crude has oscillated violently.
There are a lot of factors. 
Iran may be about to escape sanctions, which should increase supply (although one imagines a lot of it is already going to Russia for re-export or to China).
The dollar is going up, which is a drag on all commodity prices.
And,  if Russia attacks, it may suffer sanctions, which will drain supply to the west. 
And, finally, if there is a shooting war, then the Fed will turn on the liquidity taps again, cancel tightening, a put a rocket under the price of all real assets.
Which factor wins out is anyone&amp;#8217;s guess. 
For what it&amp;#8217;s worth, my guess is that the Fed will end up keeping the punchbowl topped up, and even add some extra vodka. The political consequences of nominal falls in asset prices are too awful to contemplate, in a world awash with debt.
But you already know&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; yield&amp;nbsp;curve&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is worried about the yield curve.
In a normal economy, long-dated rates carry an uncertainty premium.
Lenders need a greater annualized compensation for locking up their money for a longer term.
They bear a greater risk of inflation destroying the value of their savings.
The expectation that short-term rates will have to be raised steeply has caused these rates to go up in anticipation.
Longer term rates have moved up, but not by so much, hence the flattening. 
Nobody really knows what drives the demand for bonds.
The world is, supposedly, suffering a &amp;#8216;safe asset shortage,&amp;#8217; although I&amp;#8217;d prefer to call it a collateral shortage.
Foreign banks often have to get hold of dollars at short notice, so they use swap lines with the Fed.
My understanding is that they pledge their holdings of bonds against the risk that the (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt;) swap leaves the Fed with a loss.
If the only acceptable form of collateral is a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; T bill or bond, banks will choose the latter.
The asset is treated as risk-free, in terms of banking regulation, and therefore doesn&amp;#8217;t tie up any bank capital,
and the long-dated bonds have decent running yields compared to the interest on excess reserves, albeit low&amp;nbsp;ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this model is going wrong. The curve is flattening, and this usually happens when investors foresee a recession, which collapses inflation expectations and what is happening to the curve spooks the central bankers.
The big question is to what extent the prices (and hence yields) of long and short duration treasuries can be said to 
forecast anything in the economy, given that the Fed is manipulating rates across the maturity&amp;nbsp;spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I have said many times before, markets react to the expectations of the marginal buyer, not to the underlying macro economics.
We may see long-dated bonds big hard if everyone becomes convinced that a recession is around the corner, especially if a war with Russia spikes energy prices and diverts real resources away from western&amp;nbsp;economies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="30-10 spread" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/SgztdKl0/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional risk-off assets are gold, Swiss francs, dollars, Japanese yen. 
I am unconvinced about any of these working as a hedge.
The alternative is to short a risk-on asset, like the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt;. 
Don&amp;#8217;t try this at&amp;nbsp;home!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oil&amp;nbsp;futures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest rates for cash represent the cost of getting money now relative to the cost in the future.
A 10% interest rate means that to persuade someone to lend you $100 today, you&amp;#8217;ll have to commit to paying that person $110 in a year&amp;#8217;s time.
This is the normal situation.
For oil, that&amp;#8217;s not how it works, at least at the moment. 
To get a barrel of oil now, you&amp;#8217;ll have to pay $95.46. 
Someone will allow you to collect a barrel of oil at the end of Feb next year for $81.70: about 15% less.
This means that the &amp;#8216;interest rate&amp;#8217; on oil is negative.
In the jargon of the futures markets, oil is in&amp;nbsp;backwardation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is usually explained in terms of a temporary bottleneck in supply (or spike of demand) now
that is expected to fizzle out over time.
Certainly, it indicates that oil is not buying into the inflation&amp;nbsp;narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the market decided that Russia was not going to invade Ukraine after all, and heaved a sigh of relief.
Equity markets spiked up ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; up 2.4%), 
the dollar index sagged (95.99, down 0.38),
as did soft commodities.
The biggest change of all was a crash in the price of crude (near month future), which was down&amp;nbsp;4.9%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a mainly risk-on environment, a crash in oil seems baffling, but I guess it&amp;#8217;s that the commodity is finally taking a pause after a very strong run for the last couple of&amp;nbsp;weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Junk is&amp;nbsp;trash&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of charts showing that inflation is not tamed yet.
There are lots of charts which show that sentiment is weak as rising prices of all sorts of goods
is draining the spending power of ordinary workers.
The Fed is almost certain to raise by at least 100bp this year.
The construction sector is likely to roll over, as it is the most interest-rate sensitive of them all,
but there is a big risk that the wider equities market is crashed, because there are so many zero yield stocks&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasury bonds hold up with the economy is stalled, but anything with credit risk tends to go down.
The $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HYG&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; is a basket of weak credit bonds. It has not been doing well, and investors
are beginning to protect themselves against further losses by buying&amp;nbsp;puts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Daily shot" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/HYG_put_OI.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with buying puts is that the market makers will hedge their delta risk by selling the underlying.
This can create the opposite of the (call) gamma squeeze that Elon Musk has deployed to such deadly effect to keep the price
of $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; way above what would be justified by&amp;nbsp;fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Credentialism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody is happy with the political system we have.
Probably nobody has ever been happy with the regime they live under.
It&amp;#8217;s like a knockout tournament in tennis: everyone who enters ends up losing his last match, 
with a single exception, whatever the number of&amp;nbsp;entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans have spent an enormous amount of time thinking about why this is, and what system they can devise which will do a better job.
I guess that in primitive societies and in animal groups, there was no overarching set of rules.
The rewards went to the strongest, and disputes were resolved by fighting.
This does not work above a certain size of society, so the next least bad system is to let a king emerge.
Society strikes a bargain that it will give up its right to use force to the king, who in exchange will use what is now his 
monopoly of force to settle disputes through something called&amp;nbsp;law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practicalities of having the king resolve a dispute over the right to farm some out of the way field in the dark interior
doesn&amp;#8217;t work, so this monopoly of power is franchised out to lots of minor kings, or barons to whom these powers are delegated.
This seems to be a workable system which seems to have been refined over many millenia.
To make it workable, a system of law which codifies reasonable behaviour is developed and a specialized profession is 
created to apply these rules, and to whom power to resolve disputes is&amp;nbsp;delegated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By a process of evolution, societies each discover a system that is no less bad than neighbouring societies. 
These systems are battle harded, and work, but undoubtedly create winners and losers. 
Because all societies have losers, all societies have individuals who think that the systems they live under are unfair.
To reverse this unfairness, alternative modes of organization are proposed, and end up being&amp;nbsp;tried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These new systems: democracy, socialism, democratic socialism, anarchism, liberalism, libertarianism, Marxism, Stalinism, Xi Jin Ping thought, all probably have merit, but do not fix the fundamental problem that they create new winners and new losers.
There is another system, conservatism, which is the thesis that however bad the current system is all alternative systems will be even worse, 
and at least we know exactly where the flaws in our current system are and can individually adapt our 
lives to minimize the&amp;nbsp;downside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all societies, there is a battle for hearts and minds, and the battlefield is the media, and, increasingly, social media.
Open debate is not encouraged. Every side wants to avoid being entirely honest about the incentives they face, and the consequences for the 
losers who will be created if their proposals are enacted.
So, we end up with a sort of pretend debate where neither side is allowed to say what it is really thinking. 
In fact, there is not really any debate. There are just parallel campaigns where different parties, different political philosophies 
plug their particular line as persuasively as they can in perfectly isolated siloes. 
The elites have discovered that direcly engaging with their opponents is a futile exercise.
Buying a newspaper, or setting up a Facebook group with a hidden agenda is just so much more effective. 
I don&amp;#8217;t mean buying today&amp;#8217;s paper. I mean, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/business-23582797"&gt;like Jeff Bezos buys newspapers&lt;/a&gt;.

which are interesting to read about. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-02-10/private-funds-are-the-new-public-funds"&gt;His latest piece&lt;/a&gt; talks about the Bitfinex hack,
but through the lens of a discourse on the nature of money itself and how &amp;#8216;real&amp;#8217; dollars differ from Tesco loyalty points or air miles.
Crypto is a fascinating topic, not because of the technicalities of how the blockchain works, but how these non-currencies have some, but not all, of the characteristics of what we have traditionally viewed as money.
Oddly enough, the topic overlaps a lot with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SxOhu4q_v8"&gt;the latest episode of The Market Huddle&lt;/a&gt; which features Joseph Wang, The Fed Guy himself. Wang points out that what counts as money depends on who you are. He gives the example of a member of the public who is probably fine with the idea of a deposit in a commercial bank being money, because of the deposit guarantee, but for Amazon, that really is of no value, so they will probably have a stack of T-bills on their balance sheet, which are extremely money-like, especially since &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; got&amp;nbsp;going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why the Fed might keep its balance sheet&amp;nbsp;long&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alt-m.org/2022/02/11/friday-flashbackwhy-there-is-no-fiscal-case-for-the-feds-large-balance-sheet/"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; explains why the Fed is so reluctant to unwind its &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt;∞. 
Basically, it&amp;#8217;s now a giant hedge fund, borrowing almost costlessly to invest in speculative assets.
With &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AUM&lt;/span&gt; of $9tn (yep, $9e12), a small spread between its own carry and the yield on its assets turns into a huge 
number, which it remits to the Treasury. 
This is magic, until it loses control of the long end of the curve. 
It also explains why it will do everything in its power to keep the curve flat as a&amp;nbsp;pancake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in interesting&amp;nbsp;times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something very odd going on with oil prices. There is a high backwardation, which is an equivalent of a negative discount rate. Spot is now close to $90 for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTI&lt;/span&gt;, but goes down to $68 four years out, around 25% reduction. This doesn&amp;#8217;t make sense to me.
My expectation is that we&amp;#8217;ll see oil at some point move to contango, as nominal interest rates go more strongly negative, even if real interest rates remain negative. 
Probably, the same goes for a lot of commodities, but oil seems to be the one which has had the biggest demand shock as the world gets moving again after the pandemic.
The near month future went up 4.5%, to $93.92. This is very big&amp;nbsp;move!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YoY &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPI&lt;/span&gt; in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; hit 7.5% last month.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow"&gt;The Atlanta Fed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; Now&lt;/a&gt; reading is heading down.
It is now running at less than 1%. 
This still means that nominal &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; is growing at 8.5%, which is a pretty good clip, 
and quite enough to sustain the housing&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inflation figures, although they were close to forecasts, did push up short term rates again.
Global rates, from eurodollar futures (implied), to gilts, to 10Y USTs, to gilts all ticked up.
The 10Y yield has now crept above 2%. 
Although the redemption yield does not correspond to a single point on the discount curve, it&amp;#8217;s an important figure, 
and will keep different duration borrowings in equilibrium. The very short end (3M) is still pinned to 41bp, but it goes up quite steeply: 1Y is 1.14% (i.e. 4 hikes), which keeps an upwards sloping discount&amp;nbsp;curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks took the inflation figure to heart: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; down over 2%.
With real yields so negative, I can&amp;#8217;t see that&amp;#8217;s fully justified, but I would be still very reluctant to get long at these&amp;nbsp;levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities are all strong: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTI&lt;/span&gt; crude still managed to tick up, in the face of an increased probability of more severe tightening.
European nat. gas is up over 300% YoY. At some point, energy has to go&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly all commodities are up YoY, except solar energy and gold. Gold is practically flat. Solar energy is an odd index based on the share price of stocks in the industry, and so is not a commodity in the normal sense.

&lt;h2&gt;The incredible disappearing&amp;nbsp;workforce&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ethical Skeptic has moved on from analyzing genomes to understand where Covid came from.
He has taken a look at why there is a collapse in the partipation rate of young white men in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;.
Economists have worried about this for a while.
I am not an expert in this field, but the name David Autor comes to mind, and he certainly has written
papers which appear to be on this topic &lt;a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257%2Faeri.20180010"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skeptic pulls no punches in explaining why a young(ish) man might choose to live in his parents&amp;#8217; basement rather than
going out and doing a &amp;#8220;real job.&amp;#8221;
Not all of these factors apply in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; and Europe, but clearly some of them do.
It&amp;#8217;s all very well maximizing productivity, but if fewer and fewer people are productive,
but we have a progressive tax system, everyone will be worse&amp;nbsp;off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it&amp;#8217;s worth a read, and it&amp;#8217;s clearly very hard to&amp;nbsp;fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Money is being&amp;nbsp;created&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Fed does &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt;, banks swap their treasury bonds for reserve balances at the Fed.
The asset side of the balance sheet of the commercial banks remains steady.
The banks can lend out these reserves to the private sector, but mainly they don&amp;#8217;t.
You can lead a banker to the discount window, but you can&amp;#8217;t make him lend (to anyone but the Fed).
Banks &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; lend, though if they so desire and it seems that they actually do desire, now that the economy is being unshackled.
This is what Milton Friedman would say will lead to inflation.
And who am I to gainsay a Nobel&amp;nbsp;laureate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit card balances increased by $52 billion, the largest quarterly increase observed in the 22 year history of the data. Despite the substantial increase, credit card balances are $71 billion lower than at the end of 2019. Auto loan balances increased by $15 billion in the fourth quarter, a change similar to that seen in the fourth quarter in the previous two&amp;nbsp;years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; &lt;a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NY&lt;/span&gt; Fed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I&amp;#8217;m writing this on the morning of the 10th, so it&amp;#8217;s even more of historical interest only.)
The summary of news today was that central banks are still tightening (Romania!), 
Unemployment and inflation are still surprising on the upside (i.e. indicating stronger than expected growth of the economy), 
and government bonds are continuing to be spooked.
The 10Y yield hit 1.96%. If it goes over 2%, it will be a big deal.
The market is, in effect, already tightening for the&amp;nbsp;Fed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is&amp;nbsp;tightening?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With inflation being a headline topic in most serious news sources recently, 
we hear a lot about tightening.
This includes increasing taxation, reducing central banks&amp;#8217; balance sheets and increasing interest rates.
The narrative goes that these things &amp;#8216;take money out of the economy.&amp;#8217;
But, when you think about it, that&amp;#8217;s nonsense. 
Ignoring impacts outside the country (e.g. balance of payments, capital account etc.), savers and borrowers are exactly in balance.
When rates go up, borrowers pay more, but savers receive more, to exactly the same extent.
The redistribution moves money from one group to another. 
You could argue that savers, because their consumption is less than their income, are less likely to buy stuff if they have more income. But a lot of savers are tweaking the extent of their saving to ensure they have enough income from their savings to get by.
So, an increased return on those savings will lead to extra spending, to a greater extent than the borrowers reduce spending to be able to pay the increased financing&amp;nbsp;costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; (balance sheet adjustment), if you view the central bank and the treasury as both agents of government, the total funding requirement for the government does not change. It&amp;#8217;s just that duration of those liabilities, as held by the private sector gets longer (with tightening). This might affect prices of bonds, but I cannot see it affecting the real economy&amp;nbsp;much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to taxation, as a means of controlling inflation, the government is in a pickle. 
Governments want to be loved, and re-elected. This is difficult to achieve if you are raising taxes.
That&amp;#8217;s why central banks have become so powerful: they allow governments to spend without taxing.
With currencies no longer backed by any stable store of value (gold), this one weird trick has allowed governments 
throughout the developed world to keep spending as their populations grew old and left the workforce and as labour productivity stagnated. Anyway, governments have have been fooling all of the people all of the last fifty years, so maybe they can keep the population amused with cheap debt and Netflix. Or, maybe, we&amp;#8217;re going to get a reset, where something happens to release debtors from the real consequences of their&amp;nbsp;borrowing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I am not sure why productivity cratered, but I have a strong suspicion that it&amp;#8217;s because nearly everyone in the west works in a job which cannot be automated. Whereas the Far East is full of factories stuffed with&amp;nbsp;robots.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>US energy policy failures</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/us-energy-policy-failures.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-02-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-02-08T09:30:46+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2022-02-07:/us-energy-policy-failures.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Monday  7, February&amp;nbsp;2022&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/contortion-nation?r=nmbt&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=email"&gt;The latest&lt;/a&gt; talks about how
repressive nations like Qatar are feted by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, but domestic production of gas is stopped, to appease the green&amp;nbsp;lobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there is a problem with the world relying on fossil fuels, but current policies are the wrong ones.
They are not joined up and will cause a terrible destruction of capital and result in damage to the productive capacity of the planet.
Climate change is a difficult, technical topic. We know from how western governments handled the response to Covid that they are not very good at all at responding to these sorts of threats.
They are probably not good at most things, but the evidence is clearer when the timescale and the nature of the threat are so&amp;nbsp;circumscribed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medium-dated oil futures continue to be strong. The Dec &amp;#8216;23 95/100 call spread has been a great performer over the last month or two, and continues to be strong, even as near-dated oil futures were much weaker (near month down 0.8%). Other commodities were mixed, although precious metals and food and coal were strong.
Nat. gas (in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;)  was very weak: down more than&amp;nbsp;6%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds paused from their weakness of last week: the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UST&lt;/span&gt; 10Y yield is now 1.92%. 
Eurodollar futures were marginally higher.
This is still strongly negative in real terms.
I don&amp;#8217;t see how this will cause a global recession.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AUD&lt;/span&gt; was strong, which is a risk-on indicator, so was the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BRL&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; was down, but equity markets again were&amp;nbsp;subdued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, today felt like everyone is waiting to see what the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt; will do next.
So many central banks are tightening now, surely the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt; cannot maintain negative rates for much&amp;nbsp;longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Politics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Johnson administration seems to be in meltdown.
The Sunday papers were full of speculation on who will replace him.
It&amp;#8217;s been obvious to me for a long time that the man is a serial liar.
It&amp;#8217;s seems odd that the public somehow now seems to give a damn.
Carrie Symons, the new Mrs Johnson seems to be undermining her own husband.
Somehow she thinks it&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; to communicate to the press (through unnamed &amp;#8216;friends,&amp;#8217; which I understand is code for directly from the person concerned but off the record) that she&amp;#8217;s fed up with her husband being &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt; and she&amp;#8217;d quite like him to step down now 
and start his speaking tours of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;.

&lt;h2&gt;Investing and horse&amp;nbsp;racing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very long time ago, someone said to me that most people just didn&amp;#8217;t understand gambling.
He gave the example of a horse race. 
He explained that a lot of people just ask themselves the question &amp;#8220;Which horse is most likely to win?&amp;#8221; and put their money on that specific nag.
He pointed out that this was equivalent to just sending money direct to the bookmakers benevolent fund.
The point is that nobody &lt;em&gt;knows&lt;/em&gt; who is going to win the race, but the bookie has an idea, based on the volume of bets which have already been placed. In fact, the bookie has a very good idea of who will win, but it really doesn&amp;#8217;t make any difference to him, since he just adjusts the odds so that whichever horse wins, he&amp;#8217;ll have enough funds to pay out.
So, the key to winning, as a punter, is to find the horse that is most underpriced. 
In other words, the horse whose &amp;#8216;real&amp;#8217; odds of winning are furthest from the odds implied by the bookie&amp;#8217;s odds.
If you know that the favorite is not going to run, or that the jockey has been nobbled, then you could well win.
But it&amp;#8217;s the mis-pricing of risk that is key, just as in the&amp;nbsp;stockmarket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(It&amp;#8217;s possible that a very large bet on a long-odds horse would actually cause the bookie to lose money.
In this case, he&amp;#8217;ll probably refuse the bet, or lay off the risk with another bookie. 
It&amp;#8217;s exactly the same as an insurance underwriter re-insuring a&amp;nbsp;policy.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://macroops.substack.com/p/anticipating-anticipation?r=nmbt&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=email"&gt;This excellent piece&lt;/a&gt; takes this analysis to the next level, and incidentally has the first explanation of Soros&amp;#8217;s concept of &amp;#8216;reflexivity&amp;#8217; that I&amp;#8217;ve been able to understand.
To continue the horse-racing analogy, the stock market is a race where the starting pistol is actually fired.
It doesn&amp;#8217;t really matter if the stock makes real profits. 
Benjamin Graham famously said that in the short run the stock market is a voting machine, but in the long run it&amp;#8217;s a weighing machine.
Which means that short term stock price moves are driven by demand but ultimate returns are driven by dividends and underlying economics. 
But as Keynes said, in the long run we are all dead. So the behaviour of the voters becomes critical for predicting where a stock price will end&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock market, the price of an individual stock, has many possible outcomes, and these all reflect different narratives.
Tesla may end up driving all traditional auto-makers out of business and end up with a global monopoly. 
Or Volkswagen may master the art of producing battery cars and with its greater economies of scale and superior distribution channels crush this pesky startup into the dust. 
I have no idea which of these is correct, but by looking at these outcomes, and understanding which groups are aligned with the different narratives, it is possible to anticipate moves in $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; share price better than trying to understand whether the accounts receivables line is correctly&amp;nbsp;reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not just individual stocks. Read the article, several times, because it has some profound ideas. I&amp;#8217;ll leave you with this&amp;nbsp;quote: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George Soros was the first to discover this truth. He wrote that “Reflexivity sets up a feedback loop between market valuations and the so-called fundamentals which are being valued.” This means that the act of valuing a stock, bond, or currency, actually affects the underlying fundamentals on which they are valued, thus changing participants&amp;#8217; perceptions of what their prices should be. A process that plays out in a never-ending&amp;nbsp;loop… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why Soros says that “Financial markets, far from accurately reflecting all the available knowledge, always provides a distorted view of reality.” And that the level of distortion is “sometimes quite insignificant, and at other times quite&amp;nbsp;pronounced.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that markets are efficient most of the time except for some of the times when they become wildly not&amp;nbsp;so. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.capitalisnt.com/episodes/the-causes-and-effects-of-todays-inflation-with-raghuram-rajan"&gt;This wonderful interview with Rahuram Rajan&lt;/a&gt; really got me thinking about inflation. Rajan commented that inflation was everywhere an always an expectations phenomenon. 
So many countries, e.g. most of Latin America, have never escaped endemic inflation, and yet Japan has never managed to slay the beast of deflation. Why is this?&amp;nbsp;Expectations!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once workers decide that their wages will be worth x% less in a year&amp;#8217;s time, they&amp;#8217;ll force the hand of employers, especially the biggest employer of all, and the price setter of labour in much of the economy, the government.
Jacking up interest rates to slow down construction etc. could work, but the political fallout is now close to unbearable. 
Listen to the episode, but essential point is that there is so much debt and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; in the economy now that there is no way to unwind it without catastrophic consequences other than letting inflation painlessly wash it&amp;nbsp;away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be a year or five, but at some point we will see inflation become unanchored. Well, that&amp;#8217;s my guess, for what it&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably, for a while, inflation will be good for equities, but not forever.

&lt;h2&gt;When it comes to human health, the thing that matters most is the decline of the immune&amp;nbsp;system&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The things that get us: heart disease, cancer, possibly dementia are diseases of the immune system.
We feel old, because our immune system is kicking against our own tissues.
Most chronic disease now is autoimmune disease: diabetes, coeliac disease, Hashimoto&amp;#8217;s Disease, Graves&amp;#8217; disease, vitiligo and many more are endemic in younger&amp;nbsp;populations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent work has quantified the degree to which the immune system deteriorates. I am not sure I want mine measured, but it 
is scientific progress and we cannot hold it&amp;nbsp;back.  &lt;/p&gt;

This systemic and chronic inflammation causes organ damage and promotes vulnerability to a who’s who of diseases spanning virtually every organ system in the body and including cancer, heart attacks, strokes, neurodegeneration and&amp;nbsp;autoimmunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, there have been no metrics for accurately assessing individuals’ inflammatory status in a way that could predict these clinical problems and point to ways of addressing them or staving them off, Furman said. But now, he said, the study has produced a single-number quantitative measure that appears to do just that. -Stanford&amp;nbsp;Medicine&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Oil&amp;nbsp;Rant&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am an oil bull.
Fossil fuels may have some bad externalities, but they have been the chemical basis of our current civilization.
Most people alive now would never have been born if it were not for humans&amp;#8217; exploitation of coal,oil and gas.
For some people, this is not something that they are concerned about: if you&amp;#8217;ve never been born, you can&amp;#8217;t vote or bear a grudge.
I am not even sure if a strict utilitarian would say that would be a&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the whole of my adult life, scientists have been attempting to find alternatives to fossil fuels.
Battery vehicles were the future when I was in school, a very long time ago. 
They still are, although they account for a very small number of actual vehicle miles,
and the energy they convert into motion is largely derived from fossil fuels&amp;nbsp;still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuclear energy has been the great white hope, but from a time long before I was born. 
Transitioning to zero carbon is insanely&amp;nbsp;difficult. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To eliminate oil, we&amp;#8217;d better make it expensive. But this will have a huge impact on the economy.
The spiking oil price in 2008 certainly contributed to the global financial crisis.
All economic growth has an element of a Ponzi scheme, as Minsky said. 
It&amp;#8217;s satisfying to pop a bubble, but real pain is caused and real politicians lose their&amp;nbsp;sinecures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I&amp;#8217;d check how successful Al Gore had been in persuading the world to use less oil. 
The answer, unsurprisingly, is &amp;#8220;not&amp;nbsp;very.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/oil-production-by-country" loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Retail&amp;nbsp;squeeze?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.etfchannel.com/type/most-shorted-etfs/"&gt;ETFchannel.com&amp;#8217;s most shorted ETFs&lt;/a&gt;.
The &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; shorted (and hated) sector is retail.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;XRT&lt;/span&gt;, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPDR&lt;/span&gt; retail &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; is short to the tune of 264% of the shares outstanding. (No, I don&amp;#8217;t know how this is possible either, but ETFs are different: they can be created without limit by the issuer, so delivery would not be a problem &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt;.)
Anyway, maybe bricks and mortar retail will go the way of the steam engine, but somehow I think it&amp;#8217;s got some life in it yet,
not least because of the rise of &amp;#8220;click and collect.&amp;#8221; 
Anyway, as always, not investment&amp;nbsp;advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Daycare, nursery, Pre-K, early-years, head-start, sure start&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/pre-k-is-day-care?r=nmbt&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=email"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; makes the case that &amp;#8220;pre K&amp;#8221; education (daycare) doesn&amp;#8217;t have much of a positive effect on outcomes.
Most politicians love to promise more early years education as a measure which can &amp;#8220;level up&amp;#8221; the outcomes of poor kids and rich ones. 
It&amp;#8217;s easy to see why it appeals to politicians, and it&amp;#8217;s intuitively appealing to all of us, but it seems that it just doesn&amp;#8217;t work.
The elephant in the room is that most education doesn&amp;#8217;t have much impact, compared to other factors, but it&amp;#8217;s hard to admit this.
Well, I guess it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter, because these sorts of results have been around for a long time without making much impact on the&amp;nbsp;politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was very odd. Equities rallied strongly. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; and consumer discretionary stocks ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;) led the charge.
Elsewhere the market was tranquil, apart from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt;, where the dollar sank back to where it was before the&amp;nbsp;weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my mind, the steep fall in equities had probably got ahead of itself, and asset managers were keen to make their 
January results look not quite as terrible as they might have been.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; shot up 11% ($88 to $934), supposedly as a the result of a positive note from Credit Suisse (who make the most perfect calls of all investment bankers, as everyone&amp;nbsp;knows).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eurodollar futures and the 10Y moved by less than one bp. To me this suggests are reversal of today&amp;#8217;s equity carnage, but this is a
view I hold very weakly&amp;nbsp;indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

Some very good results from $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VISA&lt;/span&gt; were the drivers of the equity outperformance.
Arguably, these stocks are not representative of the broader&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels as though the market is underpricing the risks of a Russian invasion of Ukraine 
and the removal of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; prime minister, as well as political disruption in&amp;nbsp;France.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biden seems unable or unwilling to coordinate the west&amp;#8217;s response to Russia&amp;#8217;s aggression,
which surely spells more of&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The continued strength of the oil price is surly going to keep inflation high, 
whatever Powell does with interest&amp;nbsp;rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, western governments seem to become increasingly unable to get buy-in from their voters,
who now see them as all in the pockets of plutocrats.

&lt;h2&gt;Fed&amp;nbsp;analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my money, Alex Manzara is the best commentator on fixed income, &amp;#8220;period&amp;#8221; (as the Americans say).
Macro Alf is pretty good, and there are a lot which are worth reading, but Manzara always leaves me feeling&amp;nbsp;smarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/the-end-of-accommodation/"&gt;Manzara&amp;#8217;s latest post&lt;/a&gt; hits the nail on the head.
He points out the danger of using unemployment as a measure of slack in the economy (not exactly an original idea).
For me, the possibly profit opportunity is the fact that the Fed has signalled that it&amp;#8217;s going to taper &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MBS&lt;/span&gt; purchases.
It never made sense to me for the Fed to buy securities not issued by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury (and fairly short-dated ones at that),
but it did, and this juiced credit and equity&amp;nbsp;markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it&amp;#8217;s all going into reverse, officially.
Of course, the Fed has plenty of form for leading the market up the garden path.
Mark Carney was the &amp;#8220;unreliable boyfriend.&amp;#8221; Powell is the serial bigamist. 
However, maaaaybe this time is different and tightening will not be reversed as soon as the equity market mumbles the safe&amp;nbsp;word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity markets continue to be weak.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; rates at the short end continue to rise. 
The 7-10 year section of the curve seems to be on the point of inverting.
The dollar is very strong: $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; now at over 97.
Meme stocks and many profitless tech stocks are down heavily.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARKK&lt;/span&gt; is down 40bp, but is down 33% year to date. 
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; is down by 1.4%. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt;, which reports today, might rescue it, but in a bearish market all news is bad news.
Commodities continue to be strong,
with nat. gas up an insane&amp;nbsp;40%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market really seems to be settling into a sustained trend.

Powell confirmed what we already knew: that rates were going up,
or, in the carefully chosen language of the chairman, interest-rate hikes will &amp;#8220;soon be&amp;nbsp;appropriate.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The markets never really seem to price their overwhelming consensus in full.
Bonds moved a lot, relatively: the 10Y moved 10bp, to 1.8763%.
The nearby contract eurodollar future stands at 99.510, implying a 3M rate of 49bp.
It moved by 4.5bp, which seems a&amp;nbsp;lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The knock-on effects were visible in a fairly predictable way: 
equities were down again, in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, even though they had been strong mid-session.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt; (S&amp;amp;P500 mini futures) were down 15 points, to 4334. 
This is still several standard deviations above its trend line.
A few mega-cap stocks defied the trend, especially $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSFT&lt;/span&gt;, which were both up &amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;2%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy commodities were up quite steeply, in this case gas moving in tandem with oil, up 4% to $4.21 per 
MBTu (or whatever the unit is for gas future).
Gold, generating no income, was down, as were almost all currencies against the dollar.
To me, the very strong inflation in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; should drive the dollar down, but I obviously don&amp;#8217;t 
understand macro well&amp;nbsp;enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, Chilean and Canadian bonds all swooned. 
The club of central banks which are losening shrank a lot.
Chile&amp;#8217;s policy rate is now 5.5%. This is a strong headwind for the economy, but it allowed the currency to continue appreciating.
The new government seems to behaving sensibly. Chile has a lot of copper and food commodities.
It&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OECD&lt;/span&gt; and could be underpriced, as far as its equity market is concerned.
I have done zero research, so if you trade on what I just wrote you deserve to lose all your&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Bear sighted in the distance</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/bear-sighted-in-the-distance.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-01-25T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-02-15T20:31:34+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2022-01-25:/bear-sighted-in-the-distance.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Tuesday 25, January&amp;nbsp;2022&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been clear for quite a while now that we&amp;#8217;ve been in an &amp;#8220;everything rally.&amp;#8221;
With a few noteable exceptions, such as fossil fuel energy, gold, silver and some bricks and mortar retail stocks, 
everything seems expensive.
The world is awash in many tens of trillions of dollars of negative-yielding fixed income.
Just think about this: people are paying governments to take their money for many years in an exchange that they&amp;#8217;ll 
get a return which is negative &lt;em&gt;in nominal terms&lt;/em&gt;. In other words, people willingly invest in assets which yield less than
putting cash under a&amp;nbsp;mattress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s insane, but while markets keep making all-time highs, it&amp;#8217;s rational. 
If rates are zero today, but 0.25% in a year&amp;#8217;s time, holding a 30-year treasury bond makes sense.
As long as you don&amp;#8217;t hold it to&amp;nbsp;maturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, although they like to like to pretend otherwise, central banks are not omnipotent, and they cannot hold rates
away from the natural rate indefinitely.
There is an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOMC&lt;/span&gt; meeting today, and they are talking about raising rates.
With inflation running at 7%, they absolutely have to do it, otherwise the current real rate of around -7% is going to 
push employment beyond its natural rate, which will cause the price level to&amp;nbsp;rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be fine if the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; government was not running a deficit of around 5%, and juggling a debt burden of around 100% of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;.
If rates start to go up, the interest cost might spiral out of control.
Personally, I am not convinced this will happen: central banks can and do buy bonds for freshly-minted reserves.
Funding government spending with money is probably the cheapest way possible, over the course of a business cycle,
something that even Milton Friedman acknowledged and even&amp;nbsp;recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, central banks are getting twitchy, and the members of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOMC&lt;/span&gt; have a huge amount of their personal wealth 
tied up in the stockmarket, so they will not be capable of being wholly dispassionate about what the consequences of their
decision is for the state of the&amp;nbsp;stockmarket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, currently the market seems to be betting that the Fed will give inflation the priority.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; is down 4%, the dollar is up to 96.5,  but eurodollar futures are moving down materially.
Bonds are fairly flat, as is credit, although it&amp;#8217;s definitely trending down. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HYG&lt;/span&gt; is down from $87 to $85 
this month. I think that credit will break first: even if inflation is heading higher, the flight (to safety) 
response of the market will tend to support govt. bonds as funds flow out of (riskier)&amp;nbsp;credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy has been very strong. I can&amp;#8217;t decide if this is a rotation into a long-hated sector or a reaction to 
the probability that Russia will take control of part or all of&amp;nbsp;Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, this bearish market will reverse, but somehow I don&amp;#8217;t expect it to do so in the same timescale as we saw in March 2020.
The Fed simply doesn&amp;#8217;t have the cover to rescue the market now. Unless, &amp;#8230;, we see the start of a shooting war.

&lt;p&gt;We hear about Ukraine as a land bridge to run gas pipes through and a frontline between Russia and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NATO&lt;/span&gt;.
The reality is that it&amp;#8217;s a desperately poor country, as a consequence of all manufacturing industry being cartelized by 
a handful of oligarchs who date back to Soviet times.
Left-wing leaders in the developed world complain about modest levels of inequality at home (at least relative to communist and former communist countries) but never want to criticize the totally evil leaders like Putin and&amp;nbsp;Xi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#8217;t just a matter of politics. Having a country crippled economically by a kleptocracy results in a loss of life as sure as dropping chemical weapons does. If we want to take humanitarian action, we should at least keep these monsters outside of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent report by the National Crime Agency estimated that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; lost £100B as a result of money laundering.
If we arrested some of these crooks, rather than selling them homes in Chelsea, we&amp;#8217;d be a lot better off, and so would their currently impoverished&amp;nbsp;compatriots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities dived and then recovered today, as the trading day closed.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt; up 0.38%. 
This was a remarkable turnaround from a decline at one point of more than 4%.
Bonds were flat.
Commodities were generally down. Maybe they&amp;#8217;ll catch up with equities tomorrow, or equities will retrace.
The dollar was up, hurting commodities, and emphasizing that this was a risk-on day in spite of the 
last minute rally in&amp;nbsp;equities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that the driver is an increasing consensus that the Fed will announce a hike in a meeting this&amp;nbsp;week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARKK&lt;/span&gt; type stocks are well down on their highs.
Some sanity is returning to the market, but clearly a lot of this rubbish is not going to survive.
It would be mad to short this market seriously, but it&amp;#8217;s hard to believe that it&amp;#8217;ll return to trend any time&amp;nbsp;soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I happen to think that $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHWY&lt;/span&gt;, which is basically in the business of selling pet food over the internet, shouldn&amp;#8217;t have a 
market cap of $18B, when it can&amp;#8217;t turn a profit and has a price to book in the high 200s.
However, it went up 14% today, so go&amp;nbsp;figure!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>US Equities Puke</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/us-equities-puke.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-01-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-01-21T22:01:37+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2022-01-21:/us-equities-puke.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Friday 21, January&amp;nbsp;2022&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all attributed to worry that the Fed will&amp;nbsp;tighten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power of the Fed to influence the real economy and securities markets has been greatly exaggerated.
A superb essay by Henry Curr &lt;a href="https://spe.org.uk/site/assets/files/8729/money_printers_go_grr.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; goes

at what the point of Larry Fink&amp;#8217;s letter to CEOs is.
In some sense, it&amp;#8217;s a defence of the Friedmanite position that a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; should focus on maximizing returns to shareholders, 
and let those shareholders decide on what non-financial objectives they wish to pursue.
It&amp;#8217;s impossible to summarize: I recommend that you just read it.
His newsletter is free, except for the opportunity cost of having to read it every&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dash for (losing)&amp;nbsp;cash&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never used a food delivery app. (Boomer here!) 
I have ordered plenty of takeaways in my time, of which I&amp;#8217;ve collected on 99.5% of occasions.
The odd time I&amp;#8217;ve had food delivered, it has taken ages, and it has been cold and unappetizing by the time it reached me.
Nowadays I&amp;#8217;m good enough at basic cooking that I can rustle up something edible in less time than it would take me to order and collect a&amp;nbsp;takeaway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, all the apps make no sense to me. But they are highly priced by the market, since they have shown frenzied growth over the lockdown,
and sales and sales growth are the only metrics that matter to today&amp;#8217;s investors.
But the tide is turning, and investors are becoming sceptical.
&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4480216-doordash-pandemic-peak-will-come-down-to-earth"&gt;This hatchet job on Door Dash is worth a look&lt;/a&gt;.
The author points out the quite severe headwinds facing $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DASH&lt;/span&gt;, and the venal behaviour of its &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt;.
It&amp;#8217;s on my long-list, but it looks as though the shareprice plunge that is taking place now might spell the end.
Of course, Apple might come up with a bid for it at a premium of four times the market price, so be careful out there!
Seriously, the sector looks ripe for consolidation, which will create dangerous obstacles for any short&amp;nbsp;sellers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/political-hamburglars"&gt;Doomberg is dope&lt;/a&gt;.
This is a wonderful article about how the sausage factory works. 
You should read it, because you might learn how to make a fortune trading cattle futures.
But the main thrust of the article is how laws get passed as a &lt;em&gt;quid pro quo&lt;/em&gt; for political donations.
I was going to say &amp;#8220;as a result of lobbying,&amp;#8221; but it&amp;#8217;s nothing to do with lobbying: it&amp;#8217;s naked corruption.
As Doomberg points out, both the big parties in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; are equally implicated, so there is no where for the voter who 
doesn&amp;#8217;t want laws dictated by corporate donors to&amp;nbsp;turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSMC&lt;/span&gt; is an amazing&amp;nbsp;company&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s expensive: 150 trailing P/E, 130 forward. This doesn&amp;#8217;t leave much room for error but, damn, it must have a deeper moat than $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt; or $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMZN&lt;/span&gt;. 
I don&amp;#8217;t know about this. At least the operation makes a profit, unlike so many high-tech stocks.
Maybe the problem is that it&amp;#8217;s so big, growth will weaken going&amp;nbsp;forward.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s a software house developing autonomous driving code, with no patents, no sales, no credibility, which went public via a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPAC&lt;/span&gt;.
What&amp;#8217;s not to&amp;nbsp;like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lyn Alden Jan&amp;nbsp;Newsletter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lynalden.com/january-2022-newsletter/"&gt;Read it here.&lt;/a&gt;
Always worth a look, it seems that Lyn has moved from the stance that &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; equities are too expensive, but you gotta keep buying them anyway&amp;#8221; to the stance that &amp;#8220;Maybe inflation, tightening, commodity supply shocks and all the rest will finally make a difference.&amp;#8221;
Several good charts to show &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; exceptionalism, in terms of how much global savings ends up there. Basically 61% of global asset markets, but only 23% of global economy: a big&amp;nbsp;disconnect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Demographic&amp;nbsp;challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are getting old, as a society. The direction of travel of productivity is terrible. Growth is negative, and this weighs on the ability of societies to distribute consumption to the working classes.
The response of governments is to create money. Since 1971, there is no external anchor for currencies. 
The experiment has allowed governments to run incredible deficits and through them maintain social programs without 
offending the 0.01% that hold so much of society&amp;#8217;s wealth.
This worked remarkably well over the pandemic, but now many central banks are raising rates.
Real rates are still going down, but this will lead to inflation, which on its own will do the hard work of redistributing wealth downwards, which is politically&amp;nbsp;intolerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know what will happen, but I cannot see this ending well, and I also cannot see realized and implied volatilities on 
all assets, but particularly forex rates staying as low as they are right&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;

Forex and bonds were quiet, although the 10Y is now up at 1.88%.
Commodities all seem to be higher.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTI&lt;/span&gt; futures (front month) were up 2.52% today, with a close at $85.93 a barrel. 
The backwardation now is extremely steep: the March 2028 contract is now trading at around $60.3.
To me, this makes no sense. Oil is expensive to store, and nominal interest rates are normalizing.
The dire warnings of Mark Carney about oil majors sitting on &amp;#8220;stranded assets&amp;#8221; are sounding 
more fantastical by the day.
Oil price action is extremely bullish from a technical point of view,
which is just feeding into inflation expectations, which is feeding into interest rate futures.
Across the curve, from the Eurodollar futures to the Long Bond, futures are being&amp;nbsp;hammered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Front month ED future" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/tKf7nr9l/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This interest rate action makes for a risk-off day, especially for long-duration assets.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; was off over 2% today. JPoww will be feeling the&amp;nbsp;heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interest rate&amp;nbsp;options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implied vol on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EUR&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; forex options (well, options on futures, which are the only traded securities I can find which are priced off this vol.) is around 6%. 
This is up, I&amp;#8217;m sure, but still might be cheap if Russia decides to invade Ukraine, or cuts off gas to Germany.
I think buying puts on the one-year-out future might be worth a look, but do your own&amp;nbsp;research.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>MLK day, but interesting</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/mlk-day-but-interesting.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-01-17T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-01-18T21:45:55+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2022-01-17:/mlk-day-but-interesting.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Monday 17, January&amp;nbsp;2022&lt;/h1&gt;

This key rate is now 1.79%.
Usually, such a move would weaken the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; vs &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPY&lt;/span&gt;, but the movement has not been consistent.
The Yen has weakened from around 113 to 114, but the move has not been&amp;nbsp;monotonic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mid-month&amp;nbsp;review&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month is half way through already.
Some trends are becoming clear. 
The most dramatic one is that inflation is going up rapidly in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; and in Europe.
Mostly, this seems to be supply chain disruption as a result of a switch from consuming services,
like overseas holidays, to goods, like motor cars.
Energy prices have also gone up a lot, in part because economic activity has picked up,
in spite of Omicron variant lockdowns, and because producers are holding their nerve on 
increasing output. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OPEC&lt;/span&gt;+ seems to have learned its lesson, that all members are better off if 
none of them cheat. It&amp;#8217;s a prisoners&amp;#8217; dilemma situation, but one which is keeps being repeated.
Gas in Europe is expensive to encourage the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; to approve the finalization of Nord Stream&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments have spent a lot of money, and have paid for it by issuing a lot of debt, and creating a lot of money.
Combined with cost pressures, this is feeding into inflation, and weaking bond prices, particularly in the five to ten year range.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UST&lt;/span&gt; 10Y yield is now nearly 1.8%. This is 40 odd bps above where it was six months ago.
In today&amp;#8217;s debt-ridden world, ten basis points translates to a lot of cashflow.
The most important weapon in the armory of central banks is the widespread belief that they control the world economy,
and have a crystal ball which tells them what will happen next.
Of course, these are utterly false beliefs, but it suits the financial establishment to go along with them,
because they are fairly transparent, and if people believe that the Fed controls the market,
it&amp;#8217;s easy to make money by front running it. 
Recently, though, many serious commentators: Mohammed El-Erian, Larry Summers, Frederick Mishkin, have all publicly stated that they believe that the Fed has lost the plot.
Once the public see behind the Wizard of Oz&amp;#8217;s curtain, his power&amp;nbsp;evaporates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something odd has happened to the job market. 
Labour force participation has been going down, but at the same time as unemployment.
Quit rates are going up.
There are signs that labour, as a factor of production, is finally becoming more expensive. 
Inflationary pressures happen with a lag. 
Gas bills have not yet been delivered, new mortgage rates haven&amp;#8217;t yet bitten.
Deflationary pressures, too, will not produce changes very fast. Whatever governments do now will
not change much before the middle of the decade. 
A lot of elections will have happened between now and then.
The price of milk is very visible and salient to the ordinary voter. 
Incumbents will be disbelieved when they say they are doing something about this.
Central banks are likely to delay acting until the problem is&amp;nbsp;severe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of loss-making high-tech companies have nosebleed valuations predicated on growth continuing into the distant future,
with eventual dividends and buybacks rewarding long-term holders.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; yield curve is still inverted over the 20-30 year interval, but it not for the rest of the curve.
Eurodollar rates have been going up steadily over the last week or two.
Once that market gets some momentum, it will be difficult to stop it: nobody knows quite how big it is, but it&amp;#8217;s probably at least $20 trillion: not far off the size of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; annual &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the big unknown is China: the Middle Kingdom, but also the black hole at the centre of the global economy.
For me, the mystery is why so much long-dated debt trades at negative or near-zero yields.
This implies an expectation of a collapse in demand for debt.
Governments have an insatiable demand for debt, as do consumers outside of Asia.
It seems to me that the one thing that could export deflation to the world is an implosion in China.
Domestic demand there seems to have weakened, driving the current account deep into surplus.
At some point, to keep the factories humming, China will do something drastic, like lower its currency.
I guess this is the big threat to bond markets (if you are short!). 
Of course, China has looked unsustainable for decades, but it&amp;#8217;s kept growing at 6.5% annually.
Maybe it will continue for the next three decades.
But it&amp;#8217;s hard to see this being sustained by infrastructure and real estate investment, which is currently 40% of the Chinese&amp;nbsp;economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pandemics also might drain demand, but somehow I can&amp;#8217;t quite believe we&amp;#8217;re heading for another one. 
But you never know: they might be like&amp;nbsp;buses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="bonds or inflation: which will give?" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/bonds_or_inflationp.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caveat emptor, caveat&amp;nbsp;vendor!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech shares bounced a bit after a fairly brutal week. 
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; was up modestly (83bp), although more than the 500 (28bp). Most global markets were down.
The big news seems to be the U of Michigan consumer sentiment index, which went down to 68.2, which is the second lowest in a decade.
My guess is this is a lagged reaction to Omicron, but what do I know?
Most commodities were down, consistent with weak consumer sentiment, but oil was very strong: 2.67% for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTI&lt;/span&gt; crude futures.
In spite of weak consumer sentiment, bonds were down. 
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; 10Y is now standing at 1.79%.
There really does seem to be a change in mood about the economy.
Investors have decided that prices are not going to crash, especially core commodities like energy,
and that the world is not going to experience deflation again any time&amp;nbsp;soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only assets which were still weak were the ones in the &amp;#8220;Tiger Global Index.&amp;#8221; 
This is the&amp;nbsp;list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What would the Fed&amp;nbsp;do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed is the church of markets, and J Powell its high priest.
How the Fed reacts to events, especially how it reacts to market movements, 
is the most important driver of markets. 
Since 2000 the Fed has demonstrated its willingness to step in if markets get nervous.
The consequence of this is to keep the show on the road, but with an increasing 
amount of debt in the system, and with it, negative real interest&amp;nbsp;rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For at least twenty years pundits have been saying that there is too much debt in the system.
In Japan they&amp;#8217;ve been saying it for nearer thirty years.
The strange thing is that a weakening currency and increasingly capital formation have not happened.
The developed world has moved short term rates to zero in close lockstep, which has spared the world the 
forex instability that would otherwise have happened.
Governments have tolerated fiscal and current account deficits which would have been thought to be intolerable in the past.
This has all happened without any consumer price inflation. 
For some reason, the debt has only succeeded in inflating asset prices.
Of course, we&amp;#8217;ve seen a tidal wave of Chinese factory workers join the global workforce, as well as a massive increase in female participation almost everywhere in the developed&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that it&amp;#8217;s difficult for central banks to maintain their line that inflation is transitory. 
I am sure that in the long run it is transitory, but in the long run we are all bankrupt.
At some point soon, surely, wage settlements with big employers (the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt;, Tesco, the Royal Mail) will start running at 6% or more, which will create the famous spiral. 
To keep control of this the Fed will have to act. 
But with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; public financing requirement as big as it is, 
ten basis points is &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t want to get carried away with powder keg or nitroglycerine examples, but you can see why well known commentators, and many others, are bracing for a major crash.
The market is different today, although quantifying this is&amp;nbsp;difficult:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;much, much more equities are held in ETFs, which are 100% invested. If end investors liquidate, there is no buffer: stock will be sold to meet redemptions dollar for&amp;nbsp;dollar,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;much investing is rule based. A lot still is in 60:40 portfolios, or even variations on this that take account a fixed preference (typically based on age). This will cause bonds and stocks to be correlated more strongly than in the&amp;nbsp;past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;global markets are very correlated now. Global news media focussed on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; markets. A lot of foreign capital has flowed into dollars and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; equities. The globe as a whole is short of dollars. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; has been happy to generate more and more dollar assets to sell for&amp;nbsp;dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;crypto is an asset that will be very closely tied to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; investor&amp;nbsp;sentiment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making predictions is easy as long as one doesn&amp;#8217;t specify a timeline. That&amp;#8217;s exactly what I shall&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Carbon&amp;nbsp;Credits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Dark is banging on about carbon credits again. 
&lt;a href="https://anchor.fm/chris-dark/episodes/2-3-Carbon-Credits---A-New-Asset-Class--with-Lawson-Steele-e1c0vns"&gt;Here.&lt;/a&gt;
Don&amp;#8217;t get me wrong: I think he&amp;#8217;s right. 
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; introduced the Emissions Trading Scheme decades ago, but it seems that it&amp;#8217;s finally beginning to bite.
The theory is that as the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; withdraws tokens from the market, to constrain the ability of industrial companies to emit carbon, the permits will start to become very valuable indeed. Because people value being able to 
drive and keep their homes&amp;nbsp;warm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures seem to be the natural way to take a view on this. Or ETFs, such as $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KRBN&lt;/span&gt;.
I believe that some legacy carbon emitters, such as E.on of Germany, have already loaded up on these permits, 
to the extent that these permits may be worth more than the rest of the company put together.
To risk the stock one would have to do some more research. 
&lt;a href="https://www.cleanenergywire.org/factsheets/understanding-european-unions-emissions-trading-system"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; explains quite well how the system is designed to work. 
Although it&amp;#8217;s not perfect, it&amp;#8217;s a lot better than giving people tens of thousands of pounds to buy an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EV&lt;/span&gt;.
It must be equivalent to a carbon tax with a bundled redistributive&amp;nbsp;element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent price action indicates that markets are not convinced that these thing are a good&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The future is already&amp;nbsp;here&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems odd to think of Zoom as a disruptive technology. The first release of Skype was eighteen years ago.
It does more-or-less everything that Zoom does, but better and cheaper.
But a big change in attitude has been triggered by the pandemic. 
I think we&amp;#8217;ll never quite go all the way back to the way things&amp;nbsp;were.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Fed sounds more hawkish</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/fed-sounds-more-hawkish.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-01-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-01-06T10:50:57+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2022-01-05:/fed-sounds-more-hawkish.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Wednesday  5, January&amp;nbsp;2022&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once workers start to switch jobs for higher pay, this thing is likely to get some&amp;nbsp;momentum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed is starting to feel a bit more hawkish.
All the equity market gains of the last year are in long-duration &amp;#8216;growth&amp;#8217; stocks.
These have been hit hard, although so has the Russell 2000.
Bonds are generally down: inflation again.
The markets seem to be wondering whether a hike of a few basis points will fully counteract inflation rates of 6%, and therefore steep negative real rates.
The Euro was up&amp;nbsp;25bp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Service is being&amp;nbsp;resumed&lt;/h2&gt;

Working in windows is sometimes a bit tricky, but the windows python launcher partially enables &amp;#8216;shebang&amp;#8217; lines in scripts, which is&amp;nbsp;handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Interest rates, futures curves, backwardations,&amp;nbsp;waves&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest rates underpin all of financial modelling.
They link cashflows today to cashflows in the future.
The &amp;#8220;risk free rate&amp;#8221; is a key parameter in all derivatives valuation.
One of the odd things about the fundamental equation of finance, the Black and Scholes equation, is that it does not involve any commodity-specify discount rate (equivalently, the expected return to holding an asset). 
As a simple way of understanding this, imagine pricing an ounce of gold to be delivered in a year&amp;#8217;s time.
This can be predicted by knowing the price of gold today, and the cost of borrowing money for a year.
It doesn&amp;#8217;t depend on the supply and demand for gold in the future. You can buy the gold now, with borrowed money, and be confident that whatever happens to the market price of gold over the next year you will be able to meet your contractual obligation. Obviously, storing gold is not quite costless, so you may have to factor in a &amp;#8216;carry cost&amp;#8217; relating to warehousing the&amp;nbsp;stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, something is not quite right, as oil for delivery in five years time looks far too cheap on this model.
Storage for oil is expensive, so maybe the futures price does merely relate to unpredictable storage costs, but futures strips certainly do not behave as expected by this simple&amp;nbsp;model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if we did have a separate interest rate for every commodity, we have the added complication of credit risk. I might offer you a higher price for oil delivery in a year than I do to someone with no track record of delivering oil.
This reflects the situation in the economy. Elon Musk can borrow a lot more cheaply than some twenty year old in a dead-end job who has already been made bankrupt. Especially if Elon pledges stock in Tesla to the extent of twice the amount of the loan. 
The figures are not insignificant: credit card borrowing for poor quality borrowers will cost above 40% per year.
If George Soros&amp;#8217;s family office borrows, it will be&amp;nbsp;cheap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each individual has his own personal discount curve, which presumably depends on his expectations about how long he wants to live, how much he wishes to leave to his dependants etc. A theory that aggregates all this data and comes up with robust predictions is a tall order. No wonder economists suffer from physics&amp;nbsp;envy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble with markets is that, mostly, money does not flow into gold futures because buyers and sellers have a real need for gold in one year, but don&amp;#8217;t want the hassle of buying now and storing. 
Money flows into gold because investors bet that gold will be cheaper of more expensive in one year than the current forward price. In other words, gold is just a substitute for any other financial asset, and the changing attitudes of investors to different asset classes hugely affects the price. Anticipating these changes in fashion is what all investors are trying to do, which decouples prices from all fundamentals. Investing is difficult; did I already mention&amp;nbsp;that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What will happen in&amp;nbsp;2022?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing my theme above, how will fashions switch this year? 
I don&amp;#8217;t know, but I think that the basic understanding that meme stocks, crypto, NFTs, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt;, lockdown plays, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESG&lt;/span&gt; ETFs etc. may all be now in deep bubble territory. 
This is Kuppy&amp;#8217;s view, which I nearly always agree with.
He sets it all out &lt;a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2022/01/03/the-great-rotation/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to clone the Tiger Global holdings via unhedged.com.
In theory, this can be done &lt;a href="https://www.unhedged.com/companies/5c85268bfeae671ef2ae40b6/_/holdings/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
For some reason or other, I can&amp;#8217;t do the&amp;nbsp;export. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He talks about how liquidity can slosh around from one asset class to another, creating huge waves. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s coming this year.
A lot of gurus are saying so.
But, as some wag on Twitter remarked, the only reason so many investors are called &amp;#8216;gurus&amp;#8217; is that &amp;#8216;charlatan&amp;#8217; is so difficult to&amp;nbsp;spell.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Last Post (of the year)</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/last-post-of-the-year.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-12-31T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-31T23:07:55+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-12-31:/last-post-of-the-year.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Friday 31, December&amp;nbsp;2021&lt;/h1&gt;

In this sense the market has been risk off.
Bonds are pretty much flat. The 3M rate is pinned to zero, the 10Y is standing at 1.512%, just a fraction above the 1.49% that it has been tracking lately.
The dollar is weakening against &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAD&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EUR&lt;/span&gt;, although not &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPY&lt;/span&gt;.
Crude is up a few cents on the month, but down 2% on the day. 
Generally, all risk assets seem to be fading, except the dollar.
Vol remains very low: 17. 
I don&amp;#8217;t know how it is possible to do technical analysis on a volatily index, but if it were a stock, the $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; would look distinctly&amp;nbsp;downbeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New England is a lodestar. It shows ordinary people like me where the world is going.
It is achingly hip, and green, and averse to fossil fuels and nuclear power.
It doesn&amp;#8217;t like gas pipelines and will stop ones being built in its own states.
It wants to transition to a fossil-fuel-free electricity&amp;nbsp;grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is going in this direction, and maybe it&amp;#8217;s a good thing.
But it will not be as painless a transition as the think tankers tell you.
In New England, it&amp;#8217;s going to get very cold for a lot of people this winter, unless we get an incredibly mild winter, and at some point ordinary consumers are likely to&amp;nbsp;revolt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t do the work to prove this, but Doomberg did. I strongly urge you to read his excellent take on the situation, &lt;a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/new-england-is-an-energy-crisis-waiting?r=nmbt&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=email"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I haven&amp;#8217;t had time to read the details of what he is proposing, but I somehow doubt that it will work.
However, he&amp;#8217;s had an important tactical victory, which is likely to embolden him to try to buck the market in the future.
Some Lira bears will have lost money today, but if they&amp;#8217;ve been doing this for a while, they&amp;#8217;ll be up&amp;nbsp;overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey is pretty precarious, being dependent for imports for nearly all its energy&amp;nbsp;needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, today was risk off, except bonds didn&amp;#8217;t go up very much. They are very high, though, in the face of very high &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPI&lt;/span&gt; prints.
The Fed is coming under a lot of pressure, and more people are expressing skepticism of whether it can deliver its mandate.
If you&amp;#8217;d like to listen to a critic, just Google Jeff Snider, with his sidekick Emil Kalinowski. 
Snider&amp;#8217;s argument is that the Fed does not, in fact, control the money supply, because the Eurodollar market is vast compared even to the balance sheet of the Fed, which in any case struggles to direct the changes in the numbers close to home that it supposedly can control, such as&amp;nbsp;M2:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ray Dalio makes sense at&amp;nbsp;last&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I give $100 today how many years do I have to wait to get my $100 back and then start collecting the reward on top of what I gave? In &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, European, Japanese, and Chinese bonds an investor has to wait roughly 42 years, 450 years, 150 years, and 25 years respectively to get one’s money back and then one gets low or nil nominal returns. However, because you are trying to store buying power you have to take into consideration inflation. In the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; you have to wait over 500 years, and you will never get your buying power back in Europe or Japan. In fact, if you buy bonds in these countries now you will be guaranteed to have a lot less buying power in the future. Rather than get paid less than inflation why not instead buy stuff—any stuff—that will equal inflation or&amp;nbsp;better?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Ray&amp;nbsp;Dalio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a great fan of Ray D. I think he&amp;#8217;s wrong about China. But for sure, he makes a strong point about investing in something that is guaranteed to lose money relative to&amp;nbsp;cash.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read the quote in today&amp;#8217;s edition of &lt;a href="https://www.alphaletter.co/p/the-economics-of-investing-in-bonds?r=nmbt&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=email"&gt;The Alpha Letter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Magnesium&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s important, and now production is dominated by China, because of energy costs and environmental concerns in the West.
&lt;a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/magnesium-pi?r=nmbt&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=email"&gt;Read&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a sort of bullish for China story. It&amp;#8217;s hard to know where things will go. China has some pretty important pieces of the global economy. Either it cranks up the price, once it&amp;#8217;s cornered the market, or the West reshores production.
It seems to me that either way this stuff is going to get more&amp;nbsp;expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk off day, except the Ο (omicron) variant has spooked everyone, so cloud providers benefitted to the extent that $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; was flat.
Generally, this was a risk-off day, with oil and most non-food commodities falling, bonds up to flat.
The drop in yields supported growth stocks.
Overall, the breadth of support in the Nasdaq is very&amp;nbsp;poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In currencies, there was the usual flight to the dollar.
The big story is Turkey, whose currency is in a very poor state.
At some point the authorities are going to impose capital controls, price controls and goodness knows what.
This is not good news for the Turkish people. This should not happen to decent, hard-working&amp;nbsp;families.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Inflation again</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/inflation-again.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-12-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-16T21:51:46+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-12-16:/inflation-again.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Thursday 16, December&amp;nbsp;2021&lt;/h1&gt;

The answer is, of course, market power.
This is something that a lot of people have been saying for a while.
Anti-trust regulation in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; has been hobbled if not completely disabled by the capture of 
the legislature by corporate interests. 
Matt Stoller has been banging on about this for years, but when a fairly mainstream figure like Reich
starts fingering this as the big problem we might be seeing the Overton Window move a&amp;nbsp;bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read more &lt;a href="https://robertreich.substack.com/p/truth-about-inflation"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you think I&amp;#8217;m exaggerating, read &lt;a href="https://stephensemler.substack.com/p/campaign-cash-from-military-industry-a9d"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;#8217;s just availability bias, but the recent comment by Nancy Pelosi that she and her fellow congressmen should be allowed to profit from this very tilted playing field has enraged commentators on the left. &lt;a href="https://thecolumn.substack.com/p/build-back-better-is-shelved-dod"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; captures the mood rather well, I&amp;nbsp;think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, I like to ask myself &amp;#8220;but what does this mean for stocks?&amp;#8221;
Well, more people may be aware of the situation. Some of them may be investors who think &amp;#8220;Wow, P&amp;amp;G must be worth a punt.&amp;#8221;
But some of them might be activists, who were not aware of how bad things had got and will start to demand action,
or at least remove congressmen and senators who are too obviously corporate lackeys.
If this happens, the pendulum will swing back towards favouring labour.
This could take some time. In principle, it will bring down P/E multiples. 
Sorry to not come up with a more punchy&amp;nbsp;conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Turkey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Turkish Lira has become unanchored. 
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; focusses on the fact that Erdogan doubts the link between high interest rates and a strong currency.
To my mind, this is like doubting the link between a high yield and a high price for a bond issued by a company with a terrible credit rating.
For sure, if the Fed pushed its Fed Funds rate to 15% the dollar would go through the roof.
But nobody has any doubt that the Fed would pay out.
For Turkey, there is much more risk.
Erdogan might shut down the capital account, default on debt, generally screw his creditors.
What can they do when a sovereign issuer declines to honour its obligations? Sue it in a Turkish court, 
presided over by an Erdogan appointee? I doubt&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KE&lt;/span&gt; Holdings &amp;#8212; don&amp;#8217;t hodl or&amp;nbsp;hold!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seems to have been a massacre of the internet stocks. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; down 2.5%. Commodities generally up. Bonds up a bit.
Basically, a risk-off day and a bad day for long-duration assets in particular.
I have no idea what is driving this. Maybe winners from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; boom locking in their profits for the&amp;nbsp;year?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Alex Manzara, who I respect hugely, has just come out and made a clear and …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Wednesday 15, December&amp;nbsp;2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOMC&lt;/span&gt; meeting&amp;nbsp;today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commentators usually avoid making predictions.
Markets have an uncanny ability to make fools of all of us, 
arguably, the smartest are the ones with most to&amp;nbsp;lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Alex Manzara, who I respect hugely, has just come out and made a clear and timely prediction about the trickies market of all: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasuries (well, the whol &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; risk-free yield curve,&amp;nbsp;really).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOMC&lt;/span&gt; today.  Heres what I think is going to happen.  At 2pm when the announcement and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEP&lt;/span&gt; are released, there will be a knee-jerk reaction lower in near and red &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ED&lt;/span&gt; contracts because the dots are going higher as are the inflation projections, even &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IF&lt;/span&gt; the taper is accelerated.  However, at the 2:30 presser Powell will temper the hawkishness and by the end of the day the curve will be steeper, long rates will be higher, short end rates will be lower, and front end vol will be much&amp;nbsp;lower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my two-pennyworth, it seems obvious that the Fed doesn&amp;#8217;t want to let the curve invert, and so will not do anything to depress long-end rates
any more than they are are already depressed.
Banks (traditionally) make money by funding at the short end and lending at the long end, so will be pressing Powell to do something about the recent flattening we&amp;#8217;ve&amp;nbsp;seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many players in this market, but keeping the short end pinned to the floor will suit most of them.
As Manzara points out, the Fed cannot continue to be the marginal buyer for ever, and if that is not to crash the equity market there will have to be ultra-cheap repo rates to encourage private buyers to take on the role of buying these bonds. It&amp;#8217;s looking as though China wants to pass on the&amp;nbsp;baton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great thing about this prediction, is that we&amp;#8217;ll know if he was right this time&amp;nbsp;tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read more &lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/fomc-day-3/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. He doesn&amp;#8217;t have a mailing list, but the blog as an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; feed, which you can use to drive&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;XOM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article entitled 
&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4475039-exxon-mobil-stock-placing-bet-against-bill-gates"&gt;Exxon Mobil: Placing A Bet Against Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt;
makes the case that even in the most pessimistic scenario imaginable, Exxon will still be worth investing in now. 
This is because it is inconceivable that oil will cease to be an important source of energy in thirty years time.
Nobody is saying it will be the most important source, or that renewables will not have eaten some of Exxon&amp;#8217;s lunch.
But to assume that Exxon will have gone the way of some whale oil producer from the late 19th century is simply to misunderstand how much oil we need and how difficult it will be to do without the&amp;nbsp;stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way, the push for renewables improves the outlook for a company like Exxon.
Like a tabacco company in the 1980&amp;#8217;s when the writing was on the wall, new entrants will simply not bother.
What &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MIT&lt;/span&gt; grad now wants to start up a new oil company to take on $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;XOM&lt;/span&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this is not investment advice, and the general guidance I can give is that when a thesis is as compelling as this, it&amp;#8217;s already in the price, so you should do the opposite of what you might &amp;#8216;rationally&amp;#8217;&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you were convinced that we&amp;#8217;ll all be using 100% renewable energy in five years, read &lt;a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/california-ditzkrieg"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; for an opinion which might challenge&amp;nbsp;this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed announced it would stop buying Treasuries by March. 
This is not really a surprise.
It seemed to admit that it had got inflation completely wrong last year, 
but that it was totally confident that its forecast for next year was spot on, 
and that monetary policy had it under control.
It predicted that unemployment might drop to 3.2%, which feels like a number below the natural rate,
if you believe in that mumbo&amp;nbsp;jumbo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, because nothing very dramatic was said, the equity market rallied.
It almost always&amp;nbsp;does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar was generally down. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; at 96.3. 
Turkish Lira was down again.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasuries were down, and equities were up, 
presumably relieved that the Fed wasn&amp;#8217;t going to do anything it had not already&amp;nbsp;signalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that usually the day following the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOMC&lt;/span&gt; meeting is the one where the market really takes in what has been&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, Nancy Pelosi signalled her opposition to a proposal to limit stock trading by members of Congress and their spouces and close associates.
I think this is what is called a &amp;#8220;dog bites man&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;story.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>On China</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/on-china.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-12-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-17T09:32:35+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-12-14:/on-china.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Tuesday 14, December&amp;nbsp;2021&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;On&amp;nbsp;China&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China is a global superpower. 
It is also, notionally a communist state.
In its current form, it is the result of support given by the Soviet Union to Mao Tse Tung.
Weirdly, the Soviet Union is gone, but its client state, China, now has overtaken the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; in terms of 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; and is probably a much bigger threat to world peace than the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USSR&lt;/span&gt; ever was.
(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; has a bigger &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; at market rates, but at purchasing power parity China is already bigger. 
China has kept its currency undervalued for a long time to boost its&amp;nbsp;exports.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; has indulged China since Nixon visited Mao in 1972 (1971?).
Both China and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; saw that an alliance of convenience was their best chance of defusing the threat posed by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USSR&lt;/span&gt;.
Even now Russia is a third or fourth rank power, China continues to get favourable treatment from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;, and from Europe. 
I am not entirely sure why. It is either the fact that voters like cheap manufactured goods, or that governments like to avoid raising taxes sufficiently to pay for their spending progammes.
In fact, right wing governments like to cut taxes, which is only possible because China is the buyer of last resort of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasuries. 
Support for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasuries supports European and Japanese government bonds, via central bank swap lines and repo&amp;nbsp;markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world has a &amp;#8220;safe asset&amp;#8221; shortage, which is satisfied, largely, by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasuries. 
But they are only safe because China keeps buying them.
And China only keeps buying them, because they receive dollars for all their exports, and at least Treasuries pay a yield of sorts. (as much as&amp;nbsp;1.4%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that it seems likely that China will soon be running a current account deficit, or at least a surplus so low that it cannot absorb more than a tiny part of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; budget deficit.
China is not the only big exporter to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, and maybe Vietnam or Korea will be happy to pick up the slack, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t seem likely.
The other problem is that as China pivots to a more service-based economy, it has no need to hold its currency down. 
It might want to take control of monetary policy, so it will have to let its currency float. 
For most currencies, allowing the currency to float means allowing it to sink, often rapidly.
For China, it seems likely that it really will bob upwards. 
This is the argument for buying Chinese assets, and assets in countries that are tightly coupled with China economically, such as Korea, Taiwan,&amp;nbsp;Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t seen much evidence of this happening yet, because of the Evergrande effect.
Many Chinese stocks have started unravelling, as investors realize that the place is a cesspit of  corruption. 
Maybe there are Chinese companies with good governance. 
Maybe there are Chinese companies with bad governance which will still make a lot of money for ordinary investors.
I&amp;#8217;m waiting and watching, but I am not going to go long Evergrande any time&amp;nbsp;soon.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Ice cream sales and shark attacks</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/ice-cream-sales-and-shark-attacks.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-12-13T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-13T21:27:05+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-12-13:/ice-cream-sales-and-shark-attacks.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Monday 13, December&amp;nbsp;2021&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lyn Alden&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;newsletter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the newsletters I look forward to reading is the on from Lyn Alden.
A big plus is that it is issued only once a month.
The other is that it gives a lot of interesting&amp;nbsp;facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read her latest one &lt;a href="https://www.lynalden.com/december-2021-newsletter/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
She points out how important oil is for the global economy.
This confirms my priors, so I&amp;#8217;m predisposed to take an interest, but she gives some factual backing to the statement.
The world has got rich as a result of burning oil.
The externalities may be material, but to pretend that oil specifically, and fossil fuels generally, have not been vital to allowing us to live in the comparative ease of today is&amp;nbsp;dishonest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyn is very transparent about what she invests in. I&amp;#8217;d recommend taking a look.
Personally, I&amp;#8217;d avoid the Ponzi stocks like $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSTR&lt;/span&gt;, but I can understand why she needs them to maintain diversification to a broad range of asset classes, which is the main reason they are going&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyn points out that ice cream sales and shark attacks on swimmers tend to be correlated. 
This is not because sharks are attracted to ice cream. It&amp;#8217;s because both consumption of ice cream and availability of swimmers to attach are driven by hot weather. In the trade, this is known as &amp;#8220;the dreaded third&amp;nbsp;factor.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was a risk-off day.
The Nasdaq was off 1.5%, others more like half that, but nearly all took a hit towards the close of business in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; consumer expectations were 6% in Nov. I really think this&amp;nbsp;matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most commodities were hit hard, except gold and silver. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTI&lt;/span&gt; was down&amp;nbsp;0.6%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond yields, predictably, dropped. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; 10 year came down to 1.4156%. 
This is back to where it was in Feb. The bond market just doesn&amp;#8217;t buy the inflation narrative. Either it&amp;#8217;s wrong, or a host of pundits are wrong.
I don&amp;#8217;t want to put my money on either, but you can see why cynics put money on a crash, a crushing of demand and a flattening of the (yield)&amp;nbsp;curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There must be a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOMC&lt;/span&gt; meeting coming up. I regard today&amp;#8217;s price action as a kind of warning shot over the bow of the Fed to soften it up, to foreshadow the scale of the carnage if they dare to tighten.
It may sound crazy, but it&amp;#8217;s worked so&amp;nbsp;far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weirdly, the Turkish Lira strengthened. It has a good current account surplus, but otherwise it&amp;#8217;s hard to see the reason&amp;nbsp;why.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Julian made a big mistake in publishing materials damaging the DNC</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/julian-made-a-big-mistake-in-publishing-materials-damaging-the-dnc.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-12-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-12T17:29:20+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-12-11:/julian-made-a-big-mistake-in-publishing-materials-damaging-the-dnc.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Saturday 11, December&amp;nbsp;2021&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve always wondered why the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; is so hell-bent on destroying Julian Assange.

&lt;h2&gt;Assange&amp;#8217;s crime was to damage Hillary&amp;nbsp;Clinton&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve always wondered why the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; is so hell-bent on destroying Julian Assange.
He is of no danger to anyone, and probably never was.
It appears that the sexual assault crimes alleged against him in Sweden were a tissue of lies.
He has endured years of suffering, while holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy.
Now the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; has agreed to extradite him back to face a trial in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;.
It&amp;#8217;s not a surprise that the establishment does not like him, but the 
vehemence was hard to see, until I read 
&lt;a href="https://greenwald.substack.com/p/julian-assange-loses-appeal-british"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that revelations about corruption in the Democratic National Committee were considered so damaging to Hillary&amp;#8217;s bid in 2016 that it cost her the election. 
No wonder she wants to see him dead!
Probably, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; also wants to send a signal that it will hunt down any whistle-blower.
It seems to me that politicians in democratic regimes secretly wish they had the power over the media that their opposite numbers in dictatorships do.
Tony Blair in his autobiography hinted at a jealousy about how much Putin was feared, compared to the way he was treated by the public and the press in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a time in the 1990s that it seemed as though the Internet would destroy the power of the mass media.
Unfortunately, this didn&amp;#8217;t turn out to be the case, and instead what we read is increasingly controlled by a handful of gigantic American&amp;nbsp;firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a huge amount of misinformation around, and everyone has an axe to grind, but I feel that some background about what Assange did, and why it is so hated by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; establishment is lacking from the mainstream media.
For balance, maybe take a look at &lt;a href="http://johnpilger.com/articles/clinton-assange-and-the-war-on-truth"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; from the veteral Australian journalist John Pilger, formerly an icon of the&amp;nbsp;left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;REITs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economists are always going on about short-run and long run effects (e.g. of changing the money supply).
The long run is about waiting for the labour market to clear.
The short run is the regime where sticky prices haven&amp;#8217;t moved yet.
A lot of important prices are sticky.
Economists never seem to be very quantitative about timescales, but clearly office leases run for more than a year, maybe even five years without a rent review.
This means that the financial reports of REITs will not reveal the long-run reality of the post-pandemic year&amp;nbsp;yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guys at &lt;a href="https://landandbuildings.com/"&gt;Land and Buildings&lt;/a&gt; see trouble ahead in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;REIT&lt;/span&gt; space, and I sort of agree with them.
My guess is that working from home will be the sticky thing&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;

Anyway, it&amp;#8217;s very interesting to see how spreads have been crushed by technology.
In the old days, spreads on small cap stocks were so wide &amp;#8220;you could drive a bus through them.&amp;#8221;
Now, spreads are close, and if you use a broker like Interactive Brokers (and probably a bazillion others) you can just enter a limit order in the middle of the spread and probably get it filled pretty quickly.
So, the extent to which market makers are ripping off retail traders is probably lower than it has ever been. Sure, a lot of subscale brokers have been driven out of business, but who ever cried over a stockbroker losing&amp;nbsp;money?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it might not be nothing, and, eventually, when all the competition is ground into the dust, it might start to get really expensive and by that time it will be much too late to expect competition to fix&amp;nbsp;things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; inflation hit a 39-year high today.
Headline &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPI&lt;/span&gt; hit 6.8%.
Inflation is kryptonite for long-dated Treasuries but guess what? Yep, yields decreased. The 10Y went down, admittedly by only 1.5bp, which is not a huge amount.
The reason was, of course, that high inflation was expected, so the figure was already in the&amp;nbsp;price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar went down a bit, as one would expect, and shares rallied even more.
&amp;#8220;Consumable&amp;#8221; commodities (energy and agricultural) generally went up, but Dr Copper dropped&amp;nbsp;1%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple continued rising. It will not go down until the broader index enters a bear market. That, or Apple will end up as 99% of the broader&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point net buying by the Fed will stop. My guess is that will be mid 2022. Only then will the momentum be checked, in my&amp;nbsp;view. &lt;/p&gt;

The problem is that this money is not finding its way into the broader money supply,

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon Web Services had a major outage yesterday.
The stock price was hammered.
Nah, just kidding. It went up 3%. 
Those fees are not refundable. 
The failure of systems like Robin Hood, Netflix, Disney+, League of Legends, Tinda, Instacart, Venmo, Roku and the McDonald&amp;#8217;s app just served to remind investor how ubiquitous &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; is, and how indispensable it is to the modern Internet.
I have a Ziglu card.
The app for that seemed to be down. Not sure if it&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;linked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ghislane Maxwell&amp;nbsp;Trial&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit, I am fascinated by this trial.
There are a mass of conspiracies swirling around, 
and it does seem totally amazing that none of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; celebrities who were constantly flying on the &amp;#8220;Lolita Express&amp;#8221; 
have been called.
&lt;a href="https://patriotone.substack.com/p/twitter-suspension?r=nmbt&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=copy"&gt;The Free Press Report&lt;/a&gt; 
is doing its best, but it has had its Twitter account suspended.
Twitter really does seem to be controlling the flow of what we see,
which is fine, but then it should be treated as a&amp;nbsp;publisher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The importance of&amp;nbsp;urea&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NVEI&lt;/span&gt;:to&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spruce Point did a great hatchet job on this company.
The price collapsed 38% this morning!
People are starting to pay attention to these despicable short&amp;nbsp;sellers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPAC&lt;/span&gt; is a snowball of a car crash.
Read about it &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-12-07/the-trump-spac-pitch-is-weird"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
It&amp;#8217;s pretty crazy. 
It&amp;#8217;s hard to see how members of the public can avoid being ripped off, but none of them will be reading this, so I&amp;#8217;ll&amp;nbsp;stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Krugman is&amp;nbsp;angry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Trump, mainly, but with a change in culture in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; (and in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, in my view) about the fact that we don&amp;#8217;t stand up for things any more.
This is what he&amp;nbsp;wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn’t start with Trump. We’ve been heading this way for a long time. Back in 2006, in the aftermath of the invasion of Iraq on false pretenses and the botched response to Hurricane Katrina, I wrote about the “mensch gap” — the unwillingness of the people then running the country to accept responsibility for their own failures, their eagerness to blame others when things went wrong. Later, during the Obama era, it was striking how many critics on the right refused to acknowledge error when their predictions of runaway inflation or the abject failure of Obamacare failed to come&amp;nbsp;true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now the transformation of American conservatism — the same movement that complains about liberal “snowflakes” — into a collection of malignant whiners seems to have reached apotheosis. Yes, there are self-pitying hypocrites on the left too; but they don’t dominate the way Trump and Trump-like figures dominate the&amp;nbsp;right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inflation is coming, and it&amp;#8217;s bad for&amp;nbsp;banks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that&amp;#8217;s the thesis of &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4474061-banks-financials-deep-trouble-sell-xlf-etf"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;.
I am not totally convinced: banks have been killed by the flat or inverted yield curve, since they lend long and borrow short. 
In normal yield curve environment they are rewarded for maturity transformation.
In this financially repressed one, they are not.
As long as real assets are keeping track of inflation, banks have solid collateral and liabilities which are declining in real terms.
Having said this, there may be other moving parts I don&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;APPL&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSQ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is the stock that nobody dare short (0.6% of the float are shorted, according to Morningstar. It might be less than that in reality as some of this might be hedging for longs arising from derivatives positions).
It trades on a P/E of 30, down to promised new products, like the Apple Car and Apple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VR&lt;/span&gt; headset. 
No product has come close to the iPhone as a revenue earner in the whole time Tim Cook has been in charge.
The company pays China to allow it to not be blocked in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PRC&lt;/span&gt;, and receives a lot of money from Google to make it difficult to change the default search engine.
It is not at all innovative in software development, and is run by a bean&amp;nbsp;counter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I going to short Apple? Is the Pope Jewish? 
But you have to wonder if a 3.3% earnings yield is enough to compensate for inflation running at 6%.
A dividend yield of 50bp doesn&amp;#8217;t go far either.
Apple has supported its share price for a long time by replacing equity with debt.
For a supposedly high tech company it is heavily geared: Debt/Equity is running at around two times. 
We will see, but I can&amp;#8217;t see the next ten years for Apple being as good as the&amp;nbsp;last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the chartists will argue that the bull market will run and run. Well, it will for a while. 
But not&amp;nbsp;forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; finished &lt;em&gt;unchanged&lt;/em&gt; today. 
The market is not calm, but everyone is biding his time to see which way the market will break.
It is as if the swoon from last Friday never happened.
Everything is back to normal.
But the fact that a variant which was know to be mild, albeit more infections, could cause a fairly violent movement in 
stockmarkets in countries where it had not even arrived was pretty scary, with big risk-off moves in commodities (especially energy)
and bonds says to me that there is no depth of buying in this&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China seems extremely fragile, the yen is volatile, the sheer amount of speculation in crypto 
are all contributing to increase the&amp;nbsp;gain&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Trust the Borg!</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/trust-the-borg.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-12-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-17T09:44:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-12-07:/trust-the-borg.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Tuesday  7, December&amp;nbsp;2021&lt;/h1&gt;

I think the company probably advertised a bit around the area, and I think that one of my early schoolfriends had a father who worked there.
It&amp;#8217;s a company that people don&amp;#8217;t think about much. 
It makes bits for cars that are purchased by car manufacturers you have heard of.
I think the plant in Caerphilly made auto transmissions: gearboxes, I suppose.
Thus items which are boring but important, and which smart cookies in Silicon Valley are content to say well clear of.
The company is trading on a P/E of 11.6, and has had a pretty solid growt in profits over the last five years of approx 25%.
I bought Delphi Technologies, the former parts division of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GM&lt;/span&gt;.
This is so &amp;#8220;old economy:&amp;#8221; a company that has physical inventory, and makes steadily growing&amp;nbsp;profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it&amp;#8217;s price hasn&amp;#8217;t moved much, but it is generating loads of cash, and is a big player in a small market.
It does make stuff for EVs too as &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4473812-borgwarner-an-excellent-play-on-the-future-of-electric-vehicles?utm_campaign=RTA+Articles&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=seeking_alpha&amp;amp;utm_term=RTA+Article+Smart"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article makes&amp;nbsp;clear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent revenue (trailing twelve months) has been 50% up on last year, suggesting that when the Q3 figures are announced, this stock might get a re-rating.
The company has beaten estimates reliably, and it might be that the next beat will trigger a re-rating.
I don&amp;#8217;t suppose that it will ever become another Tesla, but it certainly could justify a P/E of 20, I feel.
As usual, this is not investment advice. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DYOR&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was another strong risk-on day.
Equities and commdities were up strongly, virtually across the board.
Apart from crypto currencies, which are not really currencies, there was not much movement.
The Turkish Lira recovered a bit from the recent rout.
Treasuries were generally down a bit, yields up, but very little, as price discovery in this market 
has been severely compromised by central bank buying.
Brazilan yields were down, presumably reflecting a reduced credit&amp;nbsp;risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seems essentially no catalyst for this.
My view is that we are still in a bull market in risk assets and 
these will continue to trend higher until there is some major dislocation,
a Minsky Moment.
We are probably still a good way off this, as the private sector has repaired its balance sheet over the course of the pandemic, assisted by the public sector.
My concern is that very large public sector debt levels will kill growth and&amp;nbsp;inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mr Hostetter&amp;#8217;s Rules for&amp;nbsp;Trading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you search for &amp;#8220;A successful speculator&amp;#8217;s approach to commodities trading&amp;#8221; by Morris Markovitz, you&amp;#8217;ll probably find a pdf of a scan of this book. The whole book is worth reading, but I thought I&amp;#8217;d transcribe the rules.
The book is from 1977. The book was written by his colleague, as a sort of memorial to a great&amp;nbsp;trader. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The dangers in trading caused by human&amp;nbsp;nature&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear &amp;#8212; fearful of profit and one acts too&amp;nbsp;soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hope &amp;#8212; hope for a change in the forces against&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of confidence in one&amp;#8217;s own&amp;nbsp;judgement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never cease do to your own&amp;nbsp;thinking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A man must not swear eternal allegiance to either the bear or the bull side. His success lies in being&amp;nbsp;right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laziness prevents a trader from keeping posted to the minute. [This was written in a time before charting&amp;nbsp;software.]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The individual fails to stick to &lt;em&gt;facts&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People believe what it pleases them to&amp;nbsp;believe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don&amp;#8217;ts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t sacrifice your position for&amp;nbsp;fluctuations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t expect the market to end in a blaze of glory. Look out for &lt;em&gt;warnings&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t expect the tape to be a lecturer. It&amp;#8217;s enough to see that something is&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never try to sell at the top. It isn&amp;#8217;t wise. Sell after a reaction, if there is no&amp;nbsp;rally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t imagine that a market that has once sold at 150 must be cheap at&amp;nbsp;130.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t buck the market&amp;nbsp;trend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t try to make an average from a losing&amp;nbsp;game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never keep goods that show a loss and sell those that show a profit. Get out with the least loss and sit tight for greater&amp;nbsp;profits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Suggestions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience must teach. Follow it&amp;nbsp;invarariably.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Observation gives the best tips of all. Observe market behaviour and experience shows how to&amp;nbsp;profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buying on a rising market is the comfortable way. The point is not so much to buy as cheap as possible or go short at top prices, but to buy and sell at the right&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember that a market is never too high for you to begin buying or too low to begin selling. Let your tape reading show you when to begin. After the initial transaction, don&amp;#8217;t make a second until the first makes a&amp;nbsp;profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a great deal in starting right in every&amp;nbsp;enterprise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When something happens on which you did not count when your plans were made, it behooves you to utilize the&amp;nbsp;opportunity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stick to facts only and govern your actions&amp;nbsp;accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is abnormal is seldom a desirable factor in a trader&amp;#8217;s calculations. If a market doesn&amp;#8217;t act right, don&amp;#8217;t touch&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Krugman vs&amp;nbsp;Friedman&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milton Friedman was a formidable economist, and person.
I have admired him for most of my adult life.
But when it comes to the Fed causing the Great Recession, I think Friedman was wrong.
The idea was that the Fed allowed the money supply to collapse (or maybe deliberately tightened monetary theory) because it didn&amp;#8217;t know what it was doing.
Krugman&amp;nbsp;writes: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why, then, did the money supply shrink? Partly because bank failures made people nervous about the safety of bank deposits; partly because in a shrinking economy people and businesses needed less money on hand for doing business. That is, the economic implosion caused the decline in money rather than the other way&amp;nbsp;around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedman didn’t actually deny this. Although his rhetoric suggested that the Fed caused the slump, if you look closely at his analysis, it says that the Fed could have prevented the slump — a pretty big&amp;nbsp;distinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how could the Fed have prevented the slump, when a large increase in the monetary base didn’t seem to prevent a sharp decline in both the money supply and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;G.D.&lt;/span&gt;P.? Friedman’s claim was that if the Fed had engaged in sufficiently large purchases of government bonds, that is, if it had increased the monetary base even more — and if it had carried out those purchases early enough — it would have headed off the monetary&amp;nbsp;collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he wasn’t very clear about how, exactly, that would have worked. When the Fed buys government debt from a bank, what does the bank do with the cash? In normal times, we might assume that the bank would lend it out to the private sector, helping to boost the economy. But in the Depression, interest rates were very low and the perceived risks high. Why wouldn’t banks have just sat on extra cash, adding it to their&amp;nbsp;reserves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My takeaway from this is that monetary policy is largely a waste of time in terms of managing the economy.
Most of economics is about real measures: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;, productivity, distribution, exports. 
Eliminating the fluctuations arising from changes in the price level is the natural thing to do.
Milton Friedman was a charismatic economist, who came late to the idea that the money supply mattered, and used the fame which followed his being awarded the Nobel Prize for this to advocate a bigger role for the market in allocating resources.
This might even be down to his desire to argue against his former classmate, Paul Samuelson, who had received the Nobel for a much more orthodox economic&amp;nbsp;approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve had a long time since 2008, and we&amp;#8217;ve had terrible productivity growth over that period, together with escalating wealth inequality. It&amp;#8217;s time to use fiscal policy, to run the economy hot, to pull more citizens into the workforce and to rebalance the returns to labour and to capital.

&lt;p&gt;but the reason the stock went down was that the results confirmed what everyone knew: that lockdown stocks
are usually chronically lossmaking.
The publishing of the figures was the trigger, but we all knew this was not a great business.
Nobody wants to go first, but there is safety in numbers.
Exactly how the crowd follows is difficult to model, but it&amp;#8217;s definitely not entirely down to the underlying&amp;nbsp;economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8212; the last domino to&amp;nbsp;fall&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been wrong about Apple for a long&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4473083-apple-the-last-domino-to-fall-in-a-market-house-of-cards?utm_campaign=RTA+Articles&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=seeking_alpha&amp;amp;utm_term=RTA+Article+Smart"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;
 makes the case that the idea that nobody ever lost money by buying Apple shares is going to be proved wrong.
The argument is that inflation will be the catalyst to re-rate the stock.
The article also makes a compelling case that, like $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; and other meme stocks, the price is being manipulated higher by gamma squeezes.
I believe that there are active parties buying short-dated call options to drive these stocks higher, but I have no idea whether this is some sort of concert party of human buyers or it&amp;#8217;s simply that some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt; algorithm has worked out that this is a way of making money. Scary? You&amp;nbsp;bet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stock&amp;nbsp;Exchanges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.netinterest.co/p/the-quest-for-monopoly?r=nmbt&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=copy"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is a wonderful account of the competing forces which interact in the case of stock&amp;nbsp;exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to declare an interest: I used to work for the London Stock Exchange, a long time ago. 
In those days, I just saw it as a natural monopoly: unit costs did not appear to me (admittedly, with no management role whatsoever) to be increasing with scale, but it seemed to me that liquidity, which was what I imagined that exchanges sell, is a function of&amp;nbsp;size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that it&amp;#8217;s more complicated than that. &lt;a href="https://www.netinterest.co/p/the-new-power-brokers"&gt;Mark Rubinstein explans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike in the 80&amp;#8217;s, when I worked for the exchange, the boring business of matching buyers and sellers is now easy:
Jeff Sprecher, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICE&lt;/span&gt;, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, said (emphasis&amp;nbsp;Rubinstein&amp;#8217;s):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, we may lose money on execution if we were to really allocate cost. And how do we make the money? Data, listings, connectivity, information, catering, we print banners, I mean, everything around the execution is where we make money. And so that helped inform us that execution is probably in a digital world is going to go to zero. I think over time finding a buyer and a seller in a world where we have the Internet is really the most simple thing in the world, and networks can form up overnight to find buyers and sellers believe that execution is not particularly valuable. about and it was helpful to buy the New York Stock Exchange, because I think the New York Stock Exchange essentially is at zero. We don&amp;#8217;t run it that way because it&amp;#8217;s a whole big business. We don&amp;#8217;t break out execution, but I don&amp;#8217;t think there&amp;#8217;s any&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not an analyst, and I can&amp;#8217;t give investment advice. 
The market is pretty bearish about oil stocks, and this one is no exception.
It has gone down, and might well go down longer, for longer than you can afford to hang on.
But it&amp;#8217;s worth a close&amp;nbsp;look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BRICs, Twenty Years&amp;nbsp;On&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://adamtooze.substack.com/p/chartbook-55-brics-twenty-years-on?r=nmbt&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=copy"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is a great overview of how the idea of the BRICs (originally excluding South Africa) was created.
It was originally about Asia, Africa coming later.
Jim O&amp;#8217;Neill had written a PhD on the recycling of oil surpluses, and its affect on the global&amp;nbsp;economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of China as a dominant economic power seems commonplace today, but I can remember people pointing out to me that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; of China was less than that of Italy, and that it would take a very long time before we needed to worry about its impact on the wider&amp;nbsp;world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fragility &amp;#8212; the new&amp;nbsp;normal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wellington.com/en-gb/insights/market-liquidity-concerns-causing-fragility-uk/"&gt;Why fragility is the new reality for the stock market&lt;/a&gt; is a new post by Wellington Management.
It is basically saying that liquidity goes away in falling markets.
This is something that anyone who has lived through a crash is well aware of. 
Maybe this time is different, though, with market makers gone, replaced by algorithmically-driven traders. 
Another problem is the pervasiveness of passive investing.
When the last active portfolio leaves, and turns off the lights, the market will have no buyers left.
Mike Green has written eloquently on this. 
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; can&amp;#8217;t not sell its holdings when clients redeem their holdings. It doesn&amp;#8217;t hold any cash and is fully invested, with no discretion given to the managers to choose what to sell. 
It really will be like the sign in the window of the closing down sale: &amp;#8220;Everything Must&amp;nbsp;Go!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquidity is a slippery concept. 
It&amp;#8217;s hard to define, but you know when it&amp;#8217;s gone.
Essentially, its the disappearance of willing counterparties who will buy what you are selling and sell what you are buying.
The fact that there are loads today, is no guarantee that there will be any tomorrow.
This is why I am very sceptical of charts which purport to show how it varies, with time. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, spreads give a proxy measure, but this is far from&amp;nbsp;perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will this make a difference? I have no&amp;nbsp;idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tesla &amp;#8212; $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDQ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a post highlighting the heavy insider selling going on at Tesla, &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4472438-tesla-its-not-just-elon-musk-selling-other-insiders-are-dumping"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
I read these pieces, but I have no idea why, because the stock price moves bear no relation to either stories like this or fundamentals.
As far as I can tell, it&amp;#8217;s a matter of buying a chain of calls designed to create some sort of gamma squeeze up as a result of market makers having to delta-hedge their option books.
Or it could just be Elon&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;Tweets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of interest, @ClaireMusk, who is critical of Tesla, has some evidence that her tweets are being suppressed by Twitter. 
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ClaireMusk/status/1465516278995632133?s=20"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is the tweet. 
I don&amp;#8217;t know if it&amp;#8217;s true, but it&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original thesis was that the $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TESLAQ&lt;/span&gt; crowd were just short sellers trying to make a dishonest buck by promoting false rumours about the stock, but short sellers of $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; must surely have moved on by now, but accounts like @ClaireMusk plug&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Peloton  &amp;#8212; $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PTON&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDQ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of boomers like me are deeply, deeply sceptical of a stock like $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PTON&lt;/span&gt;. 
It is a static exercise bike, with a iPad fixed to the handlebars.
It doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to have any discernible edge. 
If someone wants exercise, he has hundreds of options, including just going for a run outside. It&amp;#8217;s hard to compete with something that is essentially free. 
If he wants to listen to something, he can get some headphones.
If he wants to watch something, he can get a treadmill or static bike and a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;#8217;ve obviously missed something. 
Maybe this is&amp;nbsp;it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of that “big edge” comes from a bunch of “little edges” adding up. For example, last month Peloton did a dance class series with Usher, and this month Peloton expanded their partnership with Beyonce. It’s easy to dismiss those deals as small or marketing, but I think they effectively show the edge Peloton has. Huge artists like Beyonce and Usher can work with any brand they want to…. but they’re both choosing Peloton. Why? Well, big artists most valuable asset is their time. Peloton is the only scaled digital player out there; working with Peloton is the only way Beyonce / Usher can reach enough fans to justify the cost of their&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, it’s small…. but Peloton has a bunch of those small little edges, and when you put them together I think they add up to a substantial moat (on top of having the best brand in the business, the best instructors, and by far the most monthly recurring subscription&amp;nbsp;dollars).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It worked in 2000. I am not sure it worked in 2008.
I am not sure it will work now, but a stock that is strongly asset  backed and has good non-finance related cashflow probably ticks the&amp;nbsp;boxes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Oramed Pharma ($ORMD) — great medical innovation, or just great stock promotion?</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/oramed-pharma-ormd-great-medical-innovation-or-just-great-stock-promotion.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-11-28T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-02T11:32:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-11-28:/oramed-pharma-ormd-great-medical-innovation-or-just-great-stock-promotion.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;28&amp;nbsp;Nov&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Dollar&amp;nbsp;Strength&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One theory of currency prices says that in the long run the value of a currency is inversely proportional to the amount of currency in existence. The idea is that the price of a foreign currency moves with the general price level, which itself is determined by the money supply. 
As central banks boost the money supply, the currency falls.
On this theory, the dollar should be lagging badly.
In fact, the dollar has been strong, and seems to be getting stronger as equity and bond markets show increasing signs of nervousness (e.g. in terms of a spike up in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MOVE&lt;/span&gt; index, measuring the cost of bond&amp;nbsp;options).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey is an unusual country. Its president, Erdogan, is convinced that high interest rates causes inflation. This idea seems to be linked to Modern Monetary Theory. I don&amp;#8217;t know enough to explain this, but it&amp;#8217;s not a widely accepted theory, and the Turkish Lira is under a lot of pressure, and this pressure has spilled over into other emerging market currencies, the most liquid of which is the Mexican&amp;nbsp;Peso.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, I believe that sentiment is a major influence on all securities and commodities markets,  and once traders have convinced themselves that a trend has been established it will extend itself well beyond any justification in terms of fundamentals, at least in somem cases. I believe that the Lira may be a case in&amp;nbsp;point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Runs on a currency can have knock-on effects outside the markets. Turkey is not a stable place politically, and Erdogan&amp;#8217;s position is not secure. The country is on the edge of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; and has become a holding pen for migrants trying to escape chaos in the Middle East, where many countries are suffering from &amp;#8220;civil unrest&amp;#8221; and&amp;nbsp;worse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currencies have been unusually stable over the last couple of decades. The Fed has provided swap lines and repo facilties to allow the world to run massive trade deficits and subsidies for as long as anyone can remember. 
China has manipulated its currency so it can manufacture all sorts of goods at a price which has destroyed manufacturing industry in much of the developed world, and has recycled the money back into the securities markets, especially sovereign bonds, of the importing countries. I am tempted to think about Stein&amp;#8217;s Law, which states that if something cannot go on for ever it will come to a stop. I will end with a single word:&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;Evergrande.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MacroValue wrote a piece on this stock, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FNKO&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSQ&lt;/span&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s basically a manufucturer of toys, with a new sideline in NFTs. 
It&amp;#8217;s trading at a P/E of 18, and has gone up this year by 85%.
It&amp;#8217;s possibly a recovery play, but my guess is that it&amp;#8217;s a bit late to be joining the party.

The thesis is that Covid-19 hit companies whose main business is providing consumables to offices like a spoonful of novichok. 
Although most businesses have seen their shares recover beyond where they were at the end of 2019, Xerox is an exception.
It is currently trading at around 4.8 times free cashflow, which has tempted insiders to buy and even buy on the openmarket.
This is not advice. You should always do your own research, but it might be an old economy stock that suddenly becomes a&amp;nbsp;meme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cato Corp ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CATO&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSQ&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cato Corp is a fashion retailer that operates its own credit card. 
It has some fairly extensive land development interests, and managed to be cash flow positive this year without raising any&amp;nbsp;finance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is trading at a P/E of around 11, which may seem high for a business that is in direct competition with Amazon, but unless you expect shops to disappear completely, it might get a re-rating any time&amp;nbsp;now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add to the interest, there has been recent insider&amp;nbsp;buying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Oil&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democratic governments have decided that their re-electability is being threatened by rising energy prices, so they have released reserves of oil in a coordinated move to beat down the price.
The problem is that with the world consuming approx 100 million barrels of oil a day, these reserves are really not that big a deal.
After last week, oil is moving up again, which is bad for inflation and for the optics of government&amp;nbsp;actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/RfhRAGq2/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All non-monetary commodities (more or less) were up, following the jump in oil prices.
Some commodity-dominated markets were up (Brazil, Toronto) but most were down or flat.
Bonds were pretty much&amp;nbsp;flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Boris&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boris gave a speech to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CBI&lt;/span&gt; which was badly received.
I have no idea why he was giving a speech to them: we are not in an election campaign, and there are plenty of policy problems to sort out.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; was pretty scathing, but even The Sun, which is generally supportive, was not happy.
Politicians make policy errors all the time, but normally the media give them the benefit of the doubt.
Once the pendulum starts to change direction, it&amp;#8217;s hard to get them onside.
The media seem to believe that Johnson doesn&amp;#8217;t have the stomach for a protracted battle, and might step down, which surely will be a disaster, electorally, for the&amp;nbsp;Conservatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Join the&amp;nbsp;club!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s financial markets are weird. Huge amounts of money move around not because it makes any financial sense but because people enjoy coming together to join some sort of online club. And from the outside you can look at these phenomena and be like “ah, right, GameStop,” but it’s not always literally GameStop. Many modern financial phenomena are vaguely explained by “people are willing to put up real money to join an online club,” but the whole point of clubs is that there are _different _clubs. You join ConstitutionDAO because something in it speaks to something in you, or because your particular group of friends are all in that club, not — I hope? — because you are an indiscriminate club-joiner. You might like GameStop and shiba inus and scarce JPEGs and crowdfunding a copy of the Constitution but at some point how many of these things can you possibly&amp;nbsp;like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;J Powell lives to fight another&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The months of suspense are over. It&amp;#8217;s Jerome!
But there are a lot of other Fed governors left to appoint, and they are likely to be  much more progressive than J.
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rkuttnerwrites/status/1331607164763467776?s=20"&gt;Robert Kuttner points out&lt;/a&gt; that the remaining appointments are likely to clash with Powell, and quite possibly lead to his resignation, to be replaced by Brainard.

It points out&amp;nbsp;that &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now we all know Europe is a decidedly different story. Through a combination of poor planning, scientific illiteracy, and economic arrogance, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; finds itself entering peak heating season with criminally low levels of natural gas in storage. The chart below tells the story – this year’s max inventory falls well below any in recent&amp;nbsp;history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequence is big profits for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LNG&lt;/span&gt; carriers, Russia, Quatar, and Australia &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LNG&lt;/span&gt; exporters.

The Bork doctrine is about to be challenged. Bork wrote in &lt;em&gt;The Antitrust Paradox&lt;/em&gt; that allowing monopolies to develop could be good for consumers. 
I haven&amp;#8217;t read the book, but I&amp;#8217;ve read a few summaries. 
The argument seems to revolve around the relative importance of competition and economies of scale.
For example, Amazon has destroyed a lot of its competition, but at the scale it operates it can deploy masses of capital on automation and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt;, in a way that a million mom and pop stores could never do, which ends up making retail purchases cheaper.
You can see the logic, but ultimately this has to end in economic rents for Amazon, which will be very difficult to tax&amp;nbsp;away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Lina Khan it onto this, and might actually be able to force some sort of mega-tech breakup. 
Given the huge problems of passing the &amp;#8216;bipartisan&amp;#8217; &amp;#8216;Build Back Better Act&amp;#8217; this is long&amp;nbsp;shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China&amp;#8217;s catch-up is running out of&amp;nbsp;road&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/is-chinas-catch-up-growth-over?r=nmbt&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=copy"&gt;This is an interesting post&lt;/a&gt; on how China&amp;#8217;s catch-up with the developed world is doing, with some comparisons with Japan&amp;#8217;s position in 1950 and it&amp;#8217;s subsequent catch-up with the&amp;nbsp;West.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China suddenly has a lot of headwinds. A credit crunch, triggered by over-valued real estate, a megalomaniac in charge, a policy that is crushing the high-tech sector, and a new variant of Covid that seems to be designed to undermine the effectiveness of lockdowns. This is not to mention an already-ageing&amp;nbsp;population. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion of economic analysis is that the degree of catch-up is a function of the quality of institutions, and in particular the degree to which public goods are prioritized over private benefits. 
Well, it&amp;#8217;s clear that China is a kleptocracy, and a few speeches by Xi about &amp;#8220;common prosperity&amp;#8221; will not undo that. 
My take is that China has crooks in charge, and that in the long-run it&amp;#8217;ll go down the path of Russia, into economic irrelevance as capital is squirrelled away in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; assets by the offspring of officials who much prefer to live in (vaguely) democratic&amp;nbsp;societies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J Powell is given a second term as chair of the Fed. 
Nasdaq and bonds fall. 
Presumably, the market believes that Project Zimbabwe is alive and well.
Global Macro report from StoneX argues that inflation really is different this time (compared to&amp;nbsp;2008):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people are better off, particularly they have more equity in their homes, so don&amp;#8217;t have to respond to rising prices by cutting&amp;nbsp;spending,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Tea Party is over, and all parties now are determined to &amp;#8220;spend, spend, spend!&amp;#8221; because there is simply no electoral downside in doing&amp;nbsp;so,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;energy prices are rising. Shale is dead, or at least will not be produced at a loss any&amp;nbsp;longer,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the willingness and ability of China to subsidize the rest of the world by manipulating its currency down has&amp;nbsp;evaporated,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; are no longer giving away products for free, but are starting to monetize them heavily, resulting in a slump in (measured)&amp;nbsp;productivity.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who would believe that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; military would simulate a terrorist attack, just to increase government spending on defence? Only a crackpot, right? Think of the number of conspirators who would have to be in on the conspiracy, and the implausibility of the truth not coming out. That sort of thing could only happen in a dictatorship, right?
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, Putin can hide the truth from his people, but that can&amp;#8217;t happen in a democracy,&amp;nbsp;right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- give me some examples --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, there is the Club of Rome, which published &amp;#8220;Limits to Growth&amp;#8221; in 1972 saying that we&amp;#8217;d run out of &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt; and that we would have to have a global agreement to limit consumption and population.  The theory was that we&amp;#8217;d need a global government to &amp;#8216;coordinate&amp;#8217; national governments&amp;#8217; efforts, which would then morph into a global government with the ultra-wealthy pulling the&amp;nbsp;strings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure it&amp;#8217;s a theory, but Eisenhower warned, in his valedictory speech, about the threat from the &amp;#8220;Military Industrial&amp;nbsp;Nexus.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bilderberg Group, supposedly plots to form a world government, as does the World Economic Forum. 
The &amp;#8220;Great Reset&amp;#8221; is the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WEF&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s bid to control the world, under cover of the&amp;nbsp;pandemic.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rich source of conspiracy theories is the destruction of the Twin Towers in 2001. One important element is that the impact of the jets was not enough to cause the towers (as well as a smaller tower nearby, Tower 7) to collapse&amp;nbsp;completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- what is the agenda here? --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a politician speaks, it is rarely candidly and almost always with a view to getting re-elected.
This is not to say that politicians are very different to the rest of us. 
We will rarely come out with statements which make us look venal, or unreliable, or dishonest, or unfair. 
Everyone wants to be&amp;nbsp;loved!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conspiracy theorists have their own axe to grind. Most often, it will be to attract attention. 
It is much more interesting to read that a building was destroyed by a secret plot organized by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CIA&lt;/span&gt; than by an unlucky and unplanned sequence of events.
But, mostly they are denied a platform in the mainstream media, so it&amp;#8217;s a hard way to get noticed. 
Sometimes, they just have come up with an alternative explanation which fits the facts so well, they fall in love with it, and accept that being thought of as a bit odd is a price worth&amp;nbsp;paying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--  are things worse now than they were? --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be that you have missed it, but a crazy new technology is now widespread. It&amp;#8217;s called the Internet, and it gives us all access to vast quantities of high-quality and detailed information about virtually everything under the sun.
Having the ability to check if a theory is plausible or not should mean that these theories can be refuted before they get traction, right? Well, wrong, actually.  In fact, conspiracy theories thrive in the Internet, where the smallest set of like-minded, but loopy, people can get together and tell each other how smart they all are.
Hearing that Osama bin Laden is still alive, or was killed by Mossad, is much more interesting than being told that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; SEALs dumped his body at sea to prevent his burial site becoming a place of&amp;nbsp;pilgrimage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- are these cranks correct? --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the increased activity of conspiracy theorists is liked to the increasing activity of conspiractors, and dishonest of governments. 
It would seem that early advice to not use masks for Covid was the result of a desire to preserve what stocks of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PPE&lt;/span&gt; were available for hospital use. Officials stated that they had very limited or nil effects knowing this was not strictly&amp;nbsp;accurate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politicians have always run mistresses (or the male equivalent). They tend to be found out more now, which makes available more evidence that politicians lie to their spouses and others. Boris Johnson is famous for being less than completely transparent with his superiors and his wives, over his lifetime. 
I doubt if voters really care, but they are less likely to take his pronouncements about the safety of vaccines quite as seriously as they would if Frank Field were &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not convinced that the Rockerfeller Foundation is really the puppetmaster of western governments. 
But I am convinced that Larry Fink has much more influence on how the average cabinet goes about arriving at a decision than has a regular&amp;nbsp;voter.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Equities and&amp;nbsp;Crypto&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scarily, crypto has acquired all the attributes of another asset class.
It&amp;#8217;s treated rather like equities. 
&lt;a href="https://www.epsilontheory.com/prime-time-in-crypto/"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; explains that the equivalent of prime brokers already exist for crypto, in the form of Coinbase.
I guess that crypto is no less tradeable than &amp;#8216;normal&amp;#8217; currencies, and it&amp;#8217;s reasonable to provide a platform to allow people to trade them.
Trading is going to be a zero sum game (negative, once Coinbase have got paid) but people join such games all the&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this really make sense? Not to me it doesn&amp;#8217;t, but time will&amp;nbsp;tell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is this the end of DeFi as we know it,&amp;nbsp;Jim?&lt;/h2&gt;

I don&amp;#8217;t know enough about either the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEC&lt;/span&gt; or DeFi to know if this correct, but I cannot believe that it will be allowed to continue in its current unregulated form for much longer.
Governments abhor an unregulated sector, especially anything to do with finance, so I feel that it&amp;#8217;s coming. 
I imagine that the rest of the sector, which is heavily regulated, it lobbying hard to end this example of regulatory arbitrage. 
Will this be the end? No idea, but it&amp;#8217;ll be a body&amp;nbsp;blow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1.5 is dead – it&amp;#8217;s just a question of when the politicians will acknowledge&amp;nbsp;this&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a climate denier. I think that the climate is changing, and that we are at least in part to blame. But I believe that the economic cost of reducing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CO&lt;/span&gt;~2~ sufficiently to reverse warming is too much for voters to&amp;nbsp;bear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.realclearenergy.org/articles/2021/11/14/after_glasgow_15_is_dead__get_over_it_803596.html"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; points out that the politics won&amp;#8217;t work. Countries will not agree to actions which will result in economic costs. The idea that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; can do stupid stuff and that this will amount to &amp;#8220;leadership&amp;#8221; which will result in others doing the same stupid stuff is …&amp;nbsp;stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a great deal of ruin on this planet, and a lot of it can be fixed cheaply.
We could revive the Doha round of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GATT&lt;/span&gt;, and allow developing economies to export agricultural produce to the developed world. We&amp;#8217;d get cheaper food, they&amp;#8217;d get more resources. 
Oh, but the powerful farming and land-owning lobbies wouldn&amp;#8217;t like it, so it&amp;#8217;s not going to happen. 
This is the real&amp;nbsp;tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Matt&amp;nbsp;Levine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine?cmpid=BBD111821_MONEYSTUFF&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_term=211118&amp;amp;utm_campaign=moneystuff"&gt;This guy&lt;/a&gt; is amazingly good. 
So good, I&amp;#8217;d probably pay to read his stuff.
Well, maybe.
But he has a free newsletter, so it&amp;#8217;s even&amp;nbsp;better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;#8217;s post was on Zillow, and being too successful in short selling.
The Zillow post explains why trying to cheat dumb home owners by trying to get them to sell for less than their home is worth is not great marketing for the larger&amp;nbsp;business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short-selling piece is excellent. It points out that to be a successful short seller, you have to have an exit. You need to close your short (to &amp;#8216;cover&amp;#8217;).
If you&amp;#8217;ve shorted a total Ponzi, and it happens to be exposed while you have your short on, you may end up not being able to exit the position.
Also, your shorted stock may end up being turned into a &amp;#8220;meme stock&amp;#8221; and pumped on Wall Street Bets. Or be the next Tesla. Maybe the same&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Bearish Bulletin</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/bearish-bulletin.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-11-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-06T21:27:19+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-11-16:/bearish-bulletin.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Bear Cave&amp;nbsp;stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrew Walker is a great fan of Liberty Media. It is their investor day coming up and he&amp;#8217;s convinced they&amp;#8217;ll announce something important.
He seriously rates John Malone, &amp;#8220;The Cable Cowboy.&amp;#8221; He argues that with Liberty being involved in so many types of business, and geographies, the day will reveal something about how the world economy is getting on&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron ore prices have crashed. China wants steel production to be flat relative to 2020 levels. 
The rest of the world is producing more. 
Met coal is at record levels, but met coal producers are cheap.
Go figure.
The Alpha Letter has looked at all this in its newsletter for&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Commodities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities have never really joined the inflation party.
Gold perpetually disappoints, silver continues to be incredibly volatile.
Oil has been strongish, but hasn&amp;#8217;t really gone anywhere in a month.
Nat gas has a mind of its own, but certainly doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to want to end its negative correlation with oil&amp;nbsp;prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to see commodity prices continue to be strong and at the same time see the dollar strengthening. 
The same goes for bitcoin, I think, but that thing defies any analysis that has ever allowed me to make sense of it&amp;nbsp;previously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Modern&amp;nbsp;Treasury&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working for a bank is boring.
Banks just don&amp;#8217;t understand software. 
They are run by people who have contempt for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt;.
They spend a lot of money on it, and they have some systems that work.
But these systems are ugly, rigid, barnacled and boring.
They are made up of bits and pieces of code that were written by long-dead programmers in even longer-dead languages.
Nobody dare touch these systems because they are so cross-linked nobody can really tell what the knock-on impact of a seemingly minor change might be.
And, in any case, they&amp;#8217;ve lost the source&amp;nbsp;code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it probably isn&amp;#8217;t quite as bad as that, but it&amp;#8217;s not good.
Which is why &lt;a href="https://www.moderntreasury.com/?utm_source=kqPPqQ7PLV"&gt;Modern Treasury&lt;/a&gt; sounds such a great idea.
Read more about it &lt;a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/modern-treasury-the-quadrillion-quest?r=nmbt&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source="&gt;on Not Boring&lt;/a&gt;.
This is Not Boring Capital talking its own book, but it does sound like an idea whose time has&amp;nbsp;come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Week in&amp;nbsp;review&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, the only game in town is inflation.
Some commodities are crashing down: iron ore is around 92 vs. well over 200 a few months ago.
But wage pressure and rents are really picking up. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; shelter index (rents) went up by 0.5% in October alone. 
Rents in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; have been static for a long time, mainly because there is a very low turnover of tenants. As commercial mortgage rates go up, and regulation of the sector becomes stricter, and compliance costs go up, the supply of rental housing will decrease, with a short-run result of increasing rents. Obviously, the overall housing stock doesn&amp;#8217;t change, and it&amp;#8217;s not clear that falling rents will reduce supply, but for tenants who are not in a position to get a mortgage, and this is a quite a large proportion of them because they have poor credit scores, this will be bad&amp;nbsp;news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El-Erian is saying that the Fed&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Team Transitory&amp;#8221; defence is laughable, and that companies costs, both of goods and labour, are going up steeply. 
Willem Buiter makes a very strong attack on the policy of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAIT&lt;/span&gt; (&amp;#8220;Flexible Average Inflation Targetting&amp;#8221;). He argues that the policy rates should be set by forward looking&amp;nbsp;metrics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I can tell, no clear trend developed this week. 
The main event next week is the announcement of the new chair of the&amp;nbsp;Fed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>The Fed has got this covered!</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/the-fed-has-got-this-covered.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-11-10T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T19:03:38+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-11-10:/the-fed-has-got-this-covered.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;10 November&amp;nbsp;2021&lt;/h1&gt;

Oh, and China’s factory gate inflation in October rose to 13.5% in October, fastest in 26&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buyers of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TIPS&lt;/span&gt; (inflation protected securities) are not wholly&amp;nbsp;convinced:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EPSN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epsilon Energy is a relatively ungeared play on shale gas in the Permian Basin, and around.
Details are &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4467351-epsilon-energy-expanding-operations"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DYOR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; but this is a teeny market cap stock that big investors will not even look at.
Like many shale gas producers, it has been furiously redeeming debt in the last year or so.
Will it start to borrow again, once prices go up sufficiently for the bankers&amp;#8217; offers become too tempting?
Who knows, but maybe this time it really is different and the frackers will increase margins and not&amp;nbsp;debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cash flow has been weak, but last year Epsilon redeemed $9 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MM&lt;/span&gt; of debt, so it should be good for a few years.
Will gas prices continue to rise, when everyone drives a Tesla driven by wind power? Maybe, maybe not.
We are in strange&amp;nbsp;times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Zemmour&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://corporate.nordea.com/article/69442/global-bye-bye-macron-hello-zemmour"&gt;Nordea thinks that Zemmour might be a thing.&lt;/a&gt;
A French friend of mine poo-pooed the chances of Zemmour getting through to the final round of voting.
Nordea is less sanguine.
They discuss the markets&amp;#8217; likely reaction: a jump in French Treasury yields (OATs), reasoning by analogy with what happened when Trump won in 2016.
My feeling is that Zemmour is very unlike Trump in many ways, but it&amp;#8217;s worth a look.
It&amp;#8217;s a long shot, but some people might trade on the expectation of this happening, however remote, dragging down the&amp;nbsp;bonds.&lt;/p&gt;

This has nothing to do with Pareto Efficiency, the idea that equilibrium should be when any reallocation of productive resources will make at least one actor worse off.
Pareto&amp;#8217;s Law is about the fact that income and wealth distributions tend to follow a power law, and that specifically, 80% of assets are owned by 20% of people.
It&amp;#8217;s also about the fact that 90% of returns (for example) come from 10% of investments.
The problem, as the post makes clear, is that you don&amp;#8217;t know &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; which bucket trades will fall&amp;nbsp;into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting rules, ideally automatic ones, to close losing positions will help.
But I don&amp;#8217;t really think this is a complete solution. 
You can be right, but early. Cynics say that this combination is just the same as &amp;#8220;wrong&amp;#8221; but I&amp;#8217;m not so sure.
In the long run we are dead, but the market can wake up to new insights in a timescale over which most of us would hope to&amp;nbsp;survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil finally bounced. It was up $2.42 a barrel, nearly 3%, but this takes it only to $84.35, below where it was a fortnight ago.
Gold was up too, but only 31 bps. 
Other commodities were flat.
The equity markets were dragged down by $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;, down 16% over the last two sessions.
This is dramatic, but not systematic, but it did drag some linked stocks with it, notably $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARKK&lt;/span&gt;, which was down 2.35%.
Bonds were up, presumably in reaction to weakening of equities. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PPI&lt;/span&gt; was up 0.6% in Oct., an annualized rate of 7.2%, but this didn&amp;#8217;t seem to phase the masters of the universe.
Nor did tapering of bond purchases.
I always think of the discount curve in terms of a real return plus a compensation for inflation.
It is also a predictor of future interest rates.
It is conceivable that we&amp;#8217;re set for ten years of zero or negative (short) interest rate policies, which will fix ten year yields. 
The demand side will be fixed by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt;. 
This has happened in Japan. It is easy to see why it is preferable to the alternative, which is government&amp;nbsp;default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Image&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="24e98acfb0612669964b7f109f84f5c3.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/24e98acfb0612669964b7f109f84f5c3.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Forecasting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="2a38abc76aca29f687c5b7c065e6db9c.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/2a38abc76aca29f687c5b7c065e6db9c.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional economics is very bad at forecasting, even a short distance into the future.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; Budget/Autumn Spending Statement is written on the assumption of infallibility of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OBR&lt;/span&gt;.
Well, a lot of faith is put in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OBR&lt;/span&gt; forecasts for predicting the future path of the public sector borrowing requirement.
But productivity, the most important metric of all, is beyond the capabilities of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OBR&lt;/span&gt; to predict.
The naive assumption that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; simply cannot deliver any productivity gains, ever, would be much more accurate than the complex models run by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OBR&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have great sympathy with the modellers. 
Complex systems are very hard to model.
They tend to be non-linear, and very unstable with respect to initial conditions, especially when so many policies are discretionary and based on whim.
We cannot measure the output gap, or global mean temperature, with any confidence. 
But we can measure unemployment, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CO2&lt;/span&gt; levels in the atmosphere.
We should formulate automatic negative feedback mechanisms, which would at least reduce the chances of the economy, or the atmosphere, going off on some sort of runaway and unstable path, rather than leaving decisions to politicians and central bankers. Oh well, I can only&amp;nbsp;dream..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t claim to be an expert on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt;, but the Warren Mosler sect seems to believe in running the economy hot enough to drive involuntary unemployment to effectively zero.
I think this involves actually providing work, with a decent wage, to anyone who cannot find a job in the private sector.
This would remove the need for minimum wage laws, because it would set a floor under pay, just as central banks set a floor under short term interest rates by paying interest on excess&amp;nbsp;reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m nervous about these ideas, because if we allow institutional destruction of price discovery in markets for capital and labour we&amp;#8217;ve come close to stabbing a dagger into the heart of the free market, with its magical powers of allocation. But nobody seems bothered by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CB&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s destroying price discovery for debt. Maybe we should do the same for&amp;nbsp;labour.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Mao — a genius or a psychopath?</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/mao-a-genius-or-a-psychopath.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-11-08T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T19:03:50+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-11-08:/mao-a-genius-or-a-psychopath.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Politics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Owen Patterson fiasco is unbelievable. The Conservatives have had an internal coup in which a small band of Brexit fanatics have taken control of the party. In any party that cared about electoral success, Paterson would have been thrown to the wolves, but he is a true believer and so must be saved. I would be amazed if the party did not implode at the next&amp;nbsp;election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boris seems to be utterly under the control of Carrie, whom the rest of the party despises. His green policies will backfire, as people start to understand how much worse off they will be as a consequence. They call her Carrie Antoinette.&amp;#8221; It will not age&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mao&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m reading Henry Kissenger&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;On China.&amp;#8221; I am not sure how much of it he actually wrote. The early part is a competent but unoriginal history of China from its earliest origins.  I&amp;#8217;ve got to the point where he&amp;#8217;s talking about Mao. He describes Mao as a master strategist, updating Sun Tzu&amp;#8217;s philosophy to triumph in the modern era. Everything I know about Mao comes from reading the bio by Jung Chang, who paints a picture of him as a monster who caused the deaths of tens if not hundreds of millions of innocent people. A sociopath, if not a psychopath. Anyway, it&amp;#8217;s interesting to read contrasting accounts of the same&amp;nbsp;person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For what it&amp;#8217;s worth, I think that Mao operated a reign of terror, as well as a personality cult. 
The suffering which resulted from his hare-brained schemes was vast. Collectivization of agriculture was a disaster, and caused a famine that resulted in fifty million deaths.
No wonder Xi Jing Ping is tolerated so&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets continue to drift aimlessly. Yields don&amp;#8217;t know whether to go up or down, so all other markets mark time, waiting for some sort of decisive move in one direction or another. 
The Fed might or might not be helping the economy, but it surely is harming price discovery, as this price reflects a balance of &amp;#8216;real&amp;#8217; demand from economic actors and a central bank that has a hundred programs to swap Treasuries for&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;

I am not a believer in the Dark Arts, but this chart looks very unhappy to&amp;nbsp;me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that politicians are so focussed on winning elections that they never spare a thought about what they need to do when they finally seize the levers of power.
Boris Johnson seems particularly deficient in this regard, but he is largely following on a tradition that goes back at least as far as Tony Blair in 1997.
Blair more or less admits in his autobiography that he was hopelessly unprepared when he finally walked into Number&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments can do things that other entities cannot. 
They have a monopoly on the use of power.
This gives them the right to deploy national resources however they choose.
It is impossible for the individual members of a society to pay for an army, or even flood defences, however much they may wish to be defended against enemies or water.
A government can simply cut through this thicket of transaction costs.
In so many ways, governments can make collective decisions for the benefit of&amp;nbsp;citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can head off the tendency for capital to accumulate in the hands of fewer and fewer capitalists. 
They can hold back the inevitable.
But they need to be willing to set rules and enforce them, certainly in the field of enforcing of contracts, but also in managing all sorts of property rights, including the environment. 
Governments can avert the tragedy of the&amp;nbsp;commons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under highly restrictive assumptions, a free market system can approach Pareto efficiency: allocation of resources such that any change will result in at least one member of society becoming poorer. Real societies are a long way from this, but governments can guide society in the right direction.
They can at least take an active role in compensating those who would otherwise lose out when policies are enacted that will raise the productivity of society.
For example, a free trade policy will harm some sectors, but as long as those sectors which will be hurt can be identified, they can be&amp;nbsp;compensated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, targeting this compensation is not the easiest thing, but from a political point of view it is essential to at be honest about being willing to try.
The tragic thing is that parties hate to redistribute wealth in the direction of those who are not their natural supporters.
A left wing party hardly wants to cut the highest tax rate to compensate bosses who lose from a strengthening of legislation protecting labour&amp;nbsp;unions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, politics is not easy, but the present lot seem to be barely&amp;nbsp;trying.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Sofi has got so far</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/sofi-has-got-so-far.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-11-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T19:03:50+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-11-04:/sofi-has-got-so-far.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;4 Nov&amp;nbsp;2021&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;SoFi and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IPO&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;access&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am deeply sceptical of all &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EV&lt;/span&gt; manufacturers. Rivian seems to make real vehicles, and good ones, but the field is very crowded so I don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;m in.
But it looks like some retail investors will at least get the chance to invest on the same terms as early investors (well, some earlier investors).
SoFi, which is some website which I can&amp;#8217;t use because I&amp;#8217;m not in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, has some allocation which will go straight to end investors.
&lt;a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/rivian-the-most-remarkable-adventure?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTAyMDI1LCJwb3N0X2lkIjo0MzU0OTAwNiwiXyI6IjJTQkZvIiwiaWF0IjoxNjM2MDYwODI1LCJleHAiOjE2MzYwNjQ0MjUsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0xMDAyNSIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.anYrcM9qb8Jtkc4U-LzysmWVb1J2D88DGTNCi8qdSCw"&gt;Not Boring pump&lt;/a&gt;. It seems crazy that so many vehicles are ridiculously big and heavy these days. But, that&amp;#8217;s how things are, and this shows how little ordinary people care about climate change, in my&amp;nbsp;view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sofi.com/invest/ipo-investing/"&gt;SoFi&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DYOR&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bank of England presented its inflation target today. 
&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ff1c58c9-f531-4f84-b3a3-a4b41b738ed2"&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; did a good job on this&lt;/a&gt;.
The message seems to be that the bank will raise rates, but not until later.
That inflation is a problem, but in the long term will not be.
Pundits all seem to think that it will be a problem, but the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBP&lt;/span&gt; discount curve doesn&amp;#8217;t: the market doesn&amp;#8217;t.
Either the market believes that the Bank will act decisively, or that current cost push is indeed temporary.
I don&amp;#8217;t see a lot of indexation in wages or anything else right now, which I think is what will really kindle inflation.
Markets are not perfect, but are at least as good as economists at forecasting inflation, and they don&amp;#8217;t seem worried right now.
Three month Sterling &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IR&lt;/span&gt; futures jumped by 20bp, so the market definitely is not&amp;nbsp;worried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil is still in a steep backwardation, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTI&lt;/span&gt; jumped by 2%.
Equity markets were generally up.
Yields were generally down. 
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; continues to be crushed.
The bull lives&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Renault&amp;nbsp;keys&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did an odd thing last week. I purchased a car on the internet. It was delivered to me, on a flatbed trailer, by a guy from the dealership without my having ever seen the car in person.

&lt;h2&gt;Renault&amp;nbsp;keys&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did an odd thing last week. I purchased a car on the internet. It was delivered to me, on a flatbed trailer, by a guy from the dealership without my having ever seen the car in person.
I&amp;#8217;ve bought a lot of things on the internet, but never a car, second-hand or otherwise. 
The transaction worked fine, but I discovered that there was only one key which was in a poor state.
To duplicate the key, Renault charge approximately £350. 
The device is a tiny circuit board with a few contacts, some sort of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFC&lt;/span&gt; emitter and some sort of wireless connectivity.
It must cost less than a pound to manufacture.
&lt;rant&gt;I quite understand why companies do this, but it leaves such a bad taste in the mouth that I feel sure that more sales and income are lost by the policy than ever gained by the exercise of monopoly power. &lt;/rant&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all coal is created equal. 
Coal to manufacture steel, metallurgical coal, aka coking coal, is different from thermal coal.
Not that Boris understands this, but who is surprised?
The point is that there is no practical way to make steel without met coal and those established companies that mine it are probably going to do well.
Generally, well capitalized firms in the energy firms are set to clean up, in my opinion, because what bank wants to be pilloried for underwriting an issue of shares for a dirty &lt;em&gt;coal&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;company?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following stocks might be worth a look. Do your own&amp;nbsp;research!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;AMR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NYQ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;ACC1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DEU&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;CRN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ASX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;METC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NSQ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;HCC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;NYQ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Education, Education,&amp;nbsp;Education.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know what happened to Chegg, but it was down 49% the other day.
Pearson seems to be suing it.
To my mind, anything in the education sector should be&amp;nbsp;avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t bear to write about Tesla, but I can&amp;#8217;t help commenting that after Musk said it was going to sell 100K cars to Hertz, 
it turns out that no contract has been signed.
Given that this had a massive impact on the stock price, one would have thought that someone should go to jail, but given Musk&amp;#8217;s control over the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEC&lt;/span&gt; we can be fairly sure it won&amp;#8217;t be prince of&amp;nbsp;Ponzis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bonds and&amp;nbsp;tapering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed is going to shave $10 B off its monthly &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt;.
Bonds fell, but not by much. 
I think they will go eventually, and especially at the long end, but it&amp;#8217;s far too early to say now&amp;nbsp;because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Fed can do yield curve control, as it did in the&amp;nbsp;40s,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it can over tighten, crash the stock market, crush inflation, and send long-dated bonds too the&amp;nbsp;mooon,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it might be credit to be hit first, because, well,&amp;nbsp;history,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it might be emerging market dollar debt: always&amp;nbsp;flakey,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it might be European debt. The year bunds have a yield that is barely below&amp;nbsp;zero!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Meta – &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTF&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; stock formerly known as Facebook, has entered the matrix, uh, metaverse.
Does this mean that Zuck has lost it? 
Probably best not to bet against&amp;nbsp;him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read something about this stock earlier. 
It has had a stonking run.
It&amp;#8217;s a Danish logistics company.
The best stocks tend to be in the most boring&amp;nbsp;sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t done one of these for a while.
Stocks, currencies, rates, bonds, credit all have no clear trend.
I haven&amp;#8217;t a clue what&amp;#8217;s happening.
My gut is that we&amp;#8217;re in for a crash, with maybe a 5% probability.
The problem is that puts are dear. 
Until they&amp;nbsp;aren&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;

The military in Burma or Pakistan can only dream of the influence of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Military and their contractors.
The scale of the spend has now become so large that any slowdown is probably impossible.
The more that is spent, the more voters depend on that spend for their incomes.
Military contractors are past masters at spreading the manufacturing jobs for a new piece of kit over all fifty-two states, thereby ensuring low efficiency of production, but oodles of political&amp;nbsp;support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; has nothing on this. It seems to me that ultimately this millstone of spending will push the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; off its perch as a global hegemon. It may not happen in my lifetime, but it is surely coming. All empires rot from the core, and this is possibly the start of the rot in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;, although I fear that large parts of the corporate welfare state have already started to&amp;nbsp;stink. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the press is co-opted to give cover for endlessly increasing spending. One common technique is to identify another &lt;a href="https://thecolumn.substack.com/p/15-years-of-sputnik-moments-the-national?r=nmbt&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source="&gt;Sputnik Moment&lt;/a&gt; at which China (or Russia) is claimed to be pulling ahead of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; in high-tech&amp;nbsp;weaponry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Crypto coins which are also&amp;nbsp;dogs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning there was hash Hashcash. Then there was Bitcoin. Then there was an infinity of crypto &amp;#8220;currencies.&amp;#8221;
Nobody apart from nerds paid attention. Then someone realized that with enough pumping, these worthless digital tokens could be given value.
The rest was&amp;nbsp;history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogecoin was created as a sort of joke demonstration that crypto currencies can have no intrinsic value. 
A coder created the the coin in an afternoon, to show how easy it was to create a new crypto currency.
Since value is a measure of scarcity relative to demand, the infinity of supply of &amp;#8220;crypto&amp;#8221; was a demonstration that its value is nil.
Unfortunately, most of the investing world didn&amp;#8217;t understand&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real money has value derived from intrinsic or artificial scarcity. Gold can be used, because its supply is limited by the need to mine it. 
Over time, the price of gold tends to the marginal cost of production.
Liabilities of a central bank can be used because &amp;#8212; by construction &amp;#8212; reserves are limited. It helps that taxes need to be paid in tokens issued by the central bank: nothing else will do, which creates the&amp;nbsp;demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand is a psychological thing. People have surplus cash, and they may avoid the cryptos they haven&amp;#8217;t seen advertised on the Tube.
Shiba Inu, a currency named after the breed of dog owned by Elon Musk, who is famous for pumping Dogecoin, shot up 70% the other day.
There are now advertisements on the London Underground urging commuters to speculate on Floki, another coin now named after Musk&amp;#8217;s dog&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dog is a stock that never gives a decent return. I suspect that this was the motivation for naming Dogecoin. It&amp;#8217;s amazing that un-ironically this very idea is being multiplied into a product that is making someone rich. Enjoy the ride, while it&amp;nbsp;lasts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, there were no major movements.
Bonds were a bit weak but rallied at the end, the dollar was strong, commodities largely marked time apart from oats and corn.
Equities made new all-time highs, at least &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt;, but not&amp;nbsp;enthusiastically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a steady growth in the number of central banks which are hiking. This should be bearish for the dollar, but it somehow isn&amp;#8217;t. 
Maybe the expectations of Fed tightening are enough to support&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Blame the Boomers</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/blame-the-boomers.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-10-28T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:59+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-10-28:/blame-the-boomers.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;28 Oct&amp;nbsp;2021&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will this really happen? I think it depends on whether governments buy into &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt;. 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; says you can keep spending until inflation starts to bite, then you can just dial up taxes to rein it back in.
It also says that they natural rate of unemployment, which clears the asset markets and output markets, is actually very close to zero, and so a job guarantee is the right policy.
I think this may all be correct, but I don&amp;#8217;t think the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; brigade recognize the scale of the political cost of raising taxes.
Politicians are well aware that increasing spending on public services is popular with the voting public.
This makes sense. Most people are poor, and nearly all spending on public services has a distributional effect which benefits the poor.
What is odd, is that the bottom ninety percent seem to have been kept in ignorance of what is actually good for them.
But once the spending has been started, it will be very difficult to stop, at least for a government that needs votes.  Which is all of them, at least in the&amp;nbsp;West.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is Eric right? Maybe. Inflation as a phenomenon is hard to understand, but my money is on him being&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly minerals, and related services, but quite a few &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; plays. Western Digital is interesting, as it always seems to me like an &amp;#8216;old tech&amp;#8217; stock. 
Who uses mechanical disks now? Presumably, a lot of real server farms&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The value of being&amp;nbsp;wrong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The Secret to my success is that I&amp;#8217;m always wrong. I&amp;#8217;m &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALWAYS&lt;/span&gt; wrong. And I try to correct my mistakes. That&amp;#8217;s the secret of my&amp;nbsp;success.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“My approach works not by making valid predictions, but by allowing me to correct false&amp;nbsp;ones.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– George&amp;nbsp;Soros&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to do calculations of &amp;#8220;theoretical values&amp;#8221; of options and other derivatives for a living. Well, I wrote software which would do such calculations.
It sometimes involves complicated mathematics. One underlying idea is that risk-free arbitrage exists only fleetingly, and so (for example) a strip of short-dated futures will predict a long-dated one. E.g. a strip of short sterling futures can be used to predict the price of the short gilt contract. The example doesn&amp;#8217;t matter. What matters is the idea that with enough market and other data, a &amp;#8216;fair&amp;#8217; value for a security can be calculated to an arbitrary accuracy and that a profit can be locked in by buying or selling the security depending on whether its market price is higher or lower than this&amp;nbsp;value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People don&amp;#8217;t trade like this, but I don&amp;#8217;t think they use other approaches because they don&amp;#8217;t think that the idea is fundamentally flawed. 
I think that traders assume that the fair value calculation is just too complicated, or some inputs are not known with sufficient accuracy.
I think that it&amp;#8217;s worse than this. I believe that you simply can&amp;#8217;t make money this way for a fundamental reason: because the idea of what a security is worth is too important an input into it&amp;#8217;s value for the for the idea that there exists a &amp;#8216;fair value&amp;#8217; to make&amp;nbsp;sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be that this is what Soros was thinking about when he came up with the idea of &amp;#8216;reflexivity.&amp;#8217; I really don&amp;#8217;t know. I read his book on the topic, and didn&amp;#8217;t feel that I had any better understanding of it after than I had before. Well, at least after reading the brief summary on the back&amp;nbsp;cover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fraud at warp factor&amp;nbsp;five&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPACs are the railway shares of our age. In due course, most money invested in them will be lost. Some people will get extremely rich, although mostly these will be the promoters. A few lucky investors will close their positions at the top of the market. Far more will cling on, far beyond the point when they know they should have sold.
&lt;a href="https://whitediamondresearch.com/research/momentus-is-the-worst-space-themed-spac-labeled-by-the-sec-as-a-fraud/"&gt;White Diamond on Momentus ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MNTS&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; reveals an egregious fraud. Is this the most fraudulent of SPACs? Probably it is not. But it&amp;#8217;s pretty&amp;nbsp;bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, investors will wake, as if from a dream and realize that they are a lot less rich than they thought they were. This is the way of the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Build back better&amp;nbsp;corporations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post from &lt;a href="https://www.dailyposter.com/the-outer-limits-of-corporate-politics/"&gt;The Daily Poster&lt;/a&gt; sums up the problem with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; politics. 
Both parties have been captured by corporations, so they can never enact any measures that redistribute resources from corporations and their C-suite executives to the rest of the country.
Many commentators make the same points, but this is a good collection.
I don&amp;#8217;t really care about the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;, but I have noticed that they set the tone for the rest of the developed world.
The influence of corporate donors is not quite so egregious in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, but the success of K Street will not have escaped the attention of corporate lobbyists&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Dr Copper is sick</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/dr-copper-is-sick.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-10-26T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:59+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-10-26:/dr-copper-is-sick.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;26&amp;nbsp;Oct&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tesla makes a fleet sale to bankrupt car rental business&amp;nbsp;Hertz&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news of a fleet sale added 14% to the market cap of $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;, to make it one of the most valuable companies on the planet, selling at a higher multiple than Google, with a market cap now of ~$1 trillion.
To me, this is an insane valuation, but as long as there are few sellers, the price will climb. 
Elon has to issue fewer and fewer shares to fund new &amp;#8220;giga factories&amp;#8221;, and – presumably – he can afford to hire the best car engineers on the&amp;nbsp;planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The narrative is that old economy car makers can never compete with a disruptive entrant. Barnes and Noble failed to compete with Amazon. 
I am not so sure this is true, but it&amp;#8217;s possible. 
As long as the wider market keeps getting more expensive, the strategy will work. When we enter a bear market, things will be different,&amp;nbsp;maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas and most energy based commodities went up.
Gas was up 12%. 
Food is now beginning to catch up. 
As someone wrote, modern agriculture is the process of converting fossil fuel energy into food, so it&amp;#8217;s hardly surprising this is&amp;nbsp;happening.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s a tiny stock, so it&amp;#8217;s easily manipulated. It has just come out of bankruptcy, so it&amp;#8217;s definitely not for the faint-hearted.
It&amp;#8217;s bricks and mortar retail, which makes it even less attractive, but at some point it&amp;#8217;s a &amp;#8220;cigar butt with a few good puffs left in it.&amp;#8221;

&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets just haven&amp;#8217;t had any clear direction recently.
Equities, which have been going up the first half of 2020 are no directionless.
Even the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASDAQ&lt;/span&gt; 100 index hasn&amp;#8217;t recovered its all time high achieved more than a month ago.
Periodic scares push bonds up, but the threat of inflation pushes them down again (in price).
Natural gas has reached dizzy heights, but can&amp;#8217;t manage a trend lasting more than a couple of days.
Oil is pricey, but volatile.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; bounces around but is probing all time lows, but it&amp;#8217;s a while since the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; made an all-time high.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; had a good bull run, but now is faltering, presumably because of inflation fears.
Foreign exchange seems directionless, because every country is determined not to be pushed into recession by an exchange rate which rises steeply against the dollar.
Thus &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; has become universal. Equity markets globally seem to continue to benefit. There is a case for thinking that there will be some mean reversion in global equity markets.
But the under-performance of the rest of the world over the last five years has been monotonic and relentless. It would be a brave trader who bets against&amp;nbsp;it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/lJInqqj5/" alt="MSCI EAFE futures index divided by E-mini SPX futures"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, equities were generally up, with a risk-on sentiment benefiting from the launch of a Bitcoin &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt;.
Arguably.
Energy commodities were up, except lumber and steel.
Bonds were as flat as a pancake.
The dollar drifted down a bit on a trade weighted basis. 
The biggest move was &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BRL&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Whereof I cannot speak, thereof I must remain&amp;nbsp;silent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that would make for a boring blog, right? For me, the problem with cryptocurrencies is that  I just don&amp;#8217;t don&amp;#8217;t have a framework for valuing them.
I know a bit about valuation of equities, bonds, currencies, even commodities and derivatives of the above.
But crypto seems to derive its value purely from sentiment. It is not an asset in the sense it does not translate into a stream of future cashflows in any sort of real currency.
It is not physical capital, like a factory (or a hand tool) that provides utility.
It is just a record of ownership of … nothing.
The usual argument is that this makes it equivalent to a five pound note.
The difference is that there is only one Bank of England, and there is only one currency that is legal tender: a unit of account in which taxes and fines may be settled.

&lt;h2&gt;Cost Disease&amp;nbsp;Socialism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/beware-shoveling-money-at-overpriced?r=nmbt&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source="&gt;Noah Smith&amp;#8217;s post for today&lt;/a&gt; is all about what he calls Cost Disease Socialism.
It&amp;#8217;s worth reading, as is all his work, but it&amp;#8217;s long.
The key point he makes is that the new Left doesn&amp;#8217;t want to socialize the means production, distribution and exchange.
It wants to protect consumers by subsidizing necessities. 
The result is an explosion in the cost of these necessities (and the re-classifying of a lot of &amp;#8216;nice to haves&amp;#8217; into necessities).
The piece is specifically about Biden bill&amp;#8217;s plans to subsidize healthcare, which is privately provided by lightly regulated hospitals but is already insanely expensive in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;.
He points out that when you subsidize something, it gets more expensive.
Exhibit A is tuition costs at universities.
The solution? Just give poor people cash so they can spend it on what they need!
Somehow this never plays well with the&amp;nbsp;politicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a related note, the latest wheeze by our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; government is to promise to subsidize air source heat pumps.
This is basically a bung to the rich, because nobody on a modest income will be able to afford the high performance insulation, house air-tightness, Mechanical Ventilation and Heat Recover and underfloor heating that you will need to heat a home economically with an air source heat pump. 
Not to mention that you really need a big garden to make one&amp;nbsp;practical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Powell&amp;nbsp;reappointment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a drumbeat of stories which are negative for J Powell.
&lt;a href="https://prospect.org/economy/powell-sold-more-than-million-dollars-of-stock-as-market-was-tanking/"&gt;This is typical&lt;/a&gt;. Is it partisan? Sure! Is it factually incorrect? I don&amp;#8217;t think it is, or Powell would have sued.
Is Powell an embodiment of evil? I don&amp;#8217;t think so. Is Powell inclined to prioritize what is good for Wall St. over what is good for the bottom 99%? I am 99% certain he is.
Is Brainard a lot better? I doubt it, but not reappointing Powell will send a message to&amp;nbsp;her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China&amp;nbsp;Syndrome&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evergrande was terrifying. But it&amp;#8217;s not as if anyone is unaware of the plight that it, and related developers are in.
China has artificially held down its currency, so it can dominate export markets, for a very long time.
The time to buy is when blood is running in the streets.
It&amp;#8217;s arguable that now is the time for real China assets.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FXI&lt;/span&gt; is looking bouncy. Maybe a tentative bull strategy is worth looking at.
China is not going to run out of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNH&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; (why &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; the Chinese currency have two&amp;nbsp;symbols?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities broadly higher. Dollar relatively strong, especially against emerging market currencies, although &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BRL&lt;/span&gt; weak and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MXN&lt;/span&gt; strong.
Commodities generally higher, the oil complex grinding higher: monthly gain now over 18%. 
Unsurprisingly, given these risk-on moves, yields are rising across the board.
Eurodollar paused, but the 10Y now yields&amp;nbsp;1.64%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; up at near ATHs, confirming a generally risk on&amp;nbsp;sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;

Housing, is the biggest asset class on the planet. 
When it falls, other asset classes are caught in the downdraft.
People who need homes to live in, on the other hand, are better off.
All asset price movements have distributional effects. 
Housing probably has the largest. 
For every over-extended householder who loses his home, someone who could not previously afford to buy is presented with an&amp;nbsp;opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MaxLinear – looking like it&amp;#8217;s going down&amp;nbsp;exponentially&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jehoshaphat Research &lt;a href="https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJwlUM1uhCAQfprlaBhA1AOHXnrosS9gEGZXUkUj427t03dcEzLABzPfT_CEj2U73LoUEmfp6VjRZXyVCYlwE3vBrU_RAUglVS2iMxHauhWp9PcNcfZpcrTtKNZ9mFLwlJZ8NijbqlaMLvpQ69g0UYWAaojaDl30nfJ1a6028qL1e0yYA7olT8d7sJjcSLSWm_64qU9e9EqnoiosM9--cFzK6NfR03cJIyOFPO2FD2BM00mwFjow0ILVtUiO1bMHaMBorpWqoFNSwl3z10Y3Uldd_ht-FaibkfNDVWUfeGT4OQnF5grhE_mJkeLnN8iOe97nPSc6esx-mDBeYdAV6Tue_oEZN4469p4cyzGmBamhs_VlntMyihUo2whmjQt3ZUcjDui34J_4D8wci0s"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;MaxLinear&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYSE&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MXL&lt;/span&gt; — $3.70 billion), a California-based communications hardware company. Jehoshaphat called MaxLinear a “$4bn rollup of melting ice cubes.” Jehoshaphat alleged the company got a one-time &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COVID&lt;/span&gt; boost and that the company’s organic growth is actually flat. In addition, the company’s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; has sold more stock in the past 12 months than in the preceding six years combined. Jehoshaphat&amp;nbsp;wrote,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve dissected &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MXL&lt;/span&gt;’s acquisition history and found a consistent template: acquire declining asset, exceed short-term expectations with sudden, short-lived surges of growth from said asset, and then suffer the predictable evaporation of that&amp;nbsp;growth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– via The Bear&amp;nbsp;Cave&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ED&lt;/span&gt; Curve taking a&amp;nbsp;beating&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/in-to-the-fall/"&gt;Alex Manzara&amp;#8217;s weekly comment is worth reading.&lt;/a&gt; He flags up that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ED&lt;/span&gt; futures market is pricing in some actual interest rate &amp;#8216;hikes&amp;#8217; in the next year or so.
I have read a half a dozen email newsletters this morning all talking about how inflation is actually not transitory, and that it&amp;#8217;s becoming embedded. 
I really think that now absolutely everyone is talking about price increases for basically everything that we are no longer turning&amp;nbsp;Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deficit&amp;nbsp;Myths&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a battle royal going on in Washington &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt; over the Biden Build Back Better Bill. 
I don&amp;#8217;t follow politics that closely, but I have noticed how the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; tends to set the agenda for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; in terms of policies.
It&amp;#8217;s almost as if &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; politicians can&amp;#8217;t read French or German and therefore focus on the foreign policy news which is easiest for them to digest,
but I digress. The point is that more and more activists are saying that this spend can be afforded.
There are a lot of angles along which this attack can be lined up. &lt;a href="https://robertreich.substack.com/p/the-we-cant-afford-it-bullsht?r=nmbt&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source="&gt;Robert Reich&amp;#8217;s latest substack&lt;/a&gt; focusses on the Trump tax cuts and tax avoidance practiced by the ultra wealthy.
Others focus on the effectiveness of pandemic spending, and the absence of bad side effects.
The hidden support, I think, is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt;. Reich must certainly be aware of it, but probably thinks it&amp;#8217;s too heretical to use an argument.
The right has never been afraid of deficits: Reagan&amp;#8217;s success was built on deficit spending. Dick Cheney said &amp;#8220;Reagan proved that deficits don&amp;#8217;t matter.&amp;#8221; I think he was talking about electoral success, but maybe he was talking about the health of the economy but most politicians think the two are interchangeable&amp;nbsp;anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will this attitude leak into &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; politics? I think so. Boris Johnson knows that if deficits do matter, they matter to the next administration. Rishi Sunak probably thinks that he has a good shot at being the next administration, so is more focussed on jam tomorrow. But Johnson has the whip hand, and has no reason to sacrifice his approval ratings in order to boost Sunak&amp;#8217;s, so I think that by hook or by crook the autumn budget will be light on taxes and heavy on spending which, just to be clear, I would love to&amp;nbsp;see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial production was held down in September by shortages of everything, but still showed a positive quarter on quarter growth, for the fifth successive quarter.
Commodities were pretty flat.
Bonds were down a tiny bit, reflecting an increased conviction that rate rises are coming.
There was a massive short squeeze on $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;THG&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LSE&lt;/span&gt;, up over 20%. 
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; has had a fantastic run, at over $61K, showing that sentiment is still positive.
Eurodollar futures were down earlier on, but recovered later.
Uranium had a good day. Several governments seem to have realized that fission is the only practical solution for base-load electricity.
My personal view is that high-level waste could be encased in lead and used as a long-term heat&amp;nbsp;source.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Finding the guilty ones</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/finding-the-guilty-ones.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-10-16T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:58+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-10-16:/finding-the-guilty-ones.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Stock of the day: Jubilee Metals Group ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JUB&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSE&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Finding the guilty&amp;nbsp;ones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah Smith has a great piece on substack this week. You can read it &lt;a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/who-is-the-real-problem-when-it-comes?r=nmbt&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source="&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes a case that technology has moved on so much that removing our dependence on fossil fuels is now free.
That the argument that relying on wind and solar power would be expensive is based on a failure to understand how much the technologies have improved.
He argues that we are still stuck in a fossil fuelled world because, well, we&amp;#8217;re conservative.
I don&amp;#8217;t know enough quantitatively to challenge this. He doesn&amp;#8217;t give any numbers either, so it&amp;#8217;s hard to know.
But it just seems unlikely that there are there really is a free lunch in this decarbonization&amp;nbsp;lark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not a slam-dunk argument, but energy prices in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;, which is notoriously reluctant to decarbonize, are a great deal cheaper than those in Germany, which has been in the vanguard of the Green movement.
Some data is &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/418078/electricity-prices-for-households-in-germany"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; energy-intensive industry has largely shut down and the production moved overseas.
This has resulted in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; showing excellent progress in mitigating its &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CO&lt;/span&gt;~2~ emissions.
This can work for one old, post-industrial country, but it can&amp;#8217;t be applied to the whole&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;

For $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WCP&lt;/span&gt;, it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter, presumably, because the income will come from taxpayers (or, the public, via wheezes like the &amp;#8220;fossil fuel obligation&amp;#8221;).
I have solar panels: they are a crazy way of generating electricity, but as long as I get my feed-in tariff, I&amp;#8217;m&amp;nbsp;happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Expectations and&amp;nbsp;inflation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Rudd doesn&amp;#8217;t think that expectations matter, at least for determining the path of inflation.
&lt;a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2021062pap.pdf"&gt;His paper for Jackson Hole&lt;/a&gt; causes quite a stir when it came out, more for the footnotes than the content, possibly.
But expectations matter a whole lot for equity prices. In particular analysts&amp;#8217; expectations of income numbers, heavily adjusted and massaged although they nearly always are.
The problem is that they&amp;#8217;ve been been way out of line recently. I always thought that these estimates were not really estimates but numbers whispered to the (favoured) analysts by CEOs and CFOs a short time before the print, just to make sure that vested shares could be sold into a rally. Maybe I overestimated the CEOs (or underestimated the analysts), because this big overshoot has been dramatic this&amp;nbsp;time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got this from &lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/"&gt;The Market Ear&lt;/a&gt;. I can&amp;#8217;t give a link to the post, because you have to sign up for the free&amp;nbsp;newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data Trek asks the highly relevant question; how good Q3 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; corporate earnings season have to be to get a large cap stock rally into the end of 2021? Data Trek answer: &amp;#8220;In a typical quarter, companies beat Wall Street’s earnings estimates by 3-4 percent. In Q1 and Q2 2021, however, the beats were much higher: 23 and 17 percentage points above analysts’ estimates, respectively. It is that extraordinary level of operational outperformance that has given us a 17 percent &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YTD&lt;/span&gt; return on the S&amp;amp;P 500. Our answer: the companies of the S&amp;amp;P 500 need to beat by an aggregate 10 percentage points this quarter, or we’ve almost certainly seen the highs on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; equity markets for the year&amp;#8221;.&amp;nbsp;|&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Boomer house&amp;nbsp;blockers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a popular narrative that post-war baby boomers like me are blocking the path to home ownership for gen X (and gen Y etc.).
I totally agree that it is harder for many gen Xers to buy houses, but I feel it&amp;#8217;s very unfair to pin the blame on the likes of me. 
Building housing has some big externalities. People want some control over developers surrounding their village or town with suburbs that grow endlessly.
The existing residents suffer a loss, without being either the buyer or the seller of the new houses.
To mitigate this loss, which is felt very keenly, politicians in many places have given the power to local people, via their political representatives, the power to prevent development. 
From a political point of view, this is a pure gain for incumbents: the future occupiers of newly built houses have no current vote, at least in the location where the existing houses are based. 
The net result of this has resulted in a severe constriction on the supply of new houses, windfalls for land owners, and new yachts for the CEOs of large-scale housebuilders, who are able to exploit the system to generate the economic rents that flow from the barriers to entry created by the planning&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the boomers die off and bequeath their housing assets to their kids, the cycle will continue, unless some reform is put in place.
The natural solution would be to tax wealth, and particularly land value wealth, which would have the effect of bring down house prices and generate revenue for the government. Probably the most elegant way of levying this tax would be the &lt;em&gt;Common Ownership Self-assessed Tax&lt;/em&gt; of Weyl and Posner, which gets around the problem of how to value assets in which there are few or no transactions. The problem with this is selling it to voters: probably an impossible&amp;nbsp;job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only consolation to those who are locked out of the market is that a correction in house prices is surely overdue. 
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; suffered a correction after 1988, and another milder one after 2006. 
With retail price inflation cropping up seemingly everywhere, at some point the Bank of England must start to reverse its zero interest rate and unconventional monetary policies, which should have the side effect of stalling house price growth. 
While the economy is still weak after the pandemic, the very loose policy is likely to continue, but we must be near the end of this cycle.
The real challenge for the Bank is piloting the economy on a flight path that results in a soft landing. It will require a great deal of skill, and a Treasury which avoids stalling the plane by tightening fiscal policy at the same time. Some&amp;nbsp;hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The inexorable rise of passive&amp;nbsp;investing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.netinterest.co/?utm_campaign=pub&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source="&gt;This is a good summary of the rise of a new way of managing funds.&lt;/a&gt; Passive investing is huge, and it is having a huge impact on how markets behave.
In the limit, price discovery is devolved to end investors, but more importantly, it results in an endless extra allocation from cash to equities. Index funds are fully invested, active ones keep some assets in cash to allocate to equities opportunistically. (Most are not allowed to use leverage to have an allocation of more than 100%&amp;nbsp;equities.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The meat market is not a pretty&amp;nbsp;sight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amazing Matt Stoller has written a brilliant piece about why beef prices in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; are on the rise.
It&amp;#8217;s nothing to do with supply chain issues, and everything to do with four firms tying up the market.
The amazing thing is that economists have dismissed the danger of allowing the market to be cartelized in this way.
Certainly, as Ronald Coase has pointed out, organizing economic activity purely via an atomized market can give rise to intolerable transaction costs. (Coase used the term &amp;#8216;marketing costs,&amp;#8217; which was descriptive in the context in which he used it but it confusing to most readers not familiar with his&amp;nbsp;work.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the article &lt;a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/economists-to-cattle-ranchers-stop"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continued risk on. Equities all positive, commodities generally up, except gold, bonds all down (curve steepening too), forex pretty&amp;nbsp;flat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Market cycle&amp;nbsp;psychology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to subscribe to Bill Fleckenstein&amp;#8217;s daily post. 
It was interesting, but Bill suffers from being a perpetual bear, waiting for the Japan panic of 1992 to occur again in equity markets.
To be fair, Bill says that you can&amp;#8217;t prosper as a bear in a bull market, and we&amp;#8217;ve had a bull market in everything since 1981 when Volker persuaded us that the Fed could save the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon said again the other day that he believes that bitcoin is worthless. 
He also said that he wasn&amp;#8217;t going to pass up the chance of making a profit by selling it to clients of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPM&lt;/span&gt;, which you might think was a tad cynical if you had never heard of Jamie&amp;nbsp;before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin trades in a choppy directionless way, or at least has done for the last six months, as this chart from Trading View&amp;nbsp;shows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/8VBejiH5/" width=750&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, Bitcoin is the ultimate indicator of sentiment: a worthless asset with good price discovery, the price of which is (&lt;em&gt;I think&lt;/em&gt;) hard to manipulate in a coordinated&amp;nbsp;way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downloads of Robinhood, the app, have cratered. Chamath and Cathie are yesterday&amp;#8217;s men (and women). Investors have learned that SPACs are the road to riches, but only for the sponsors. Central banks around the world have started tightening. Labour has started to flex its muscles, relative to capital. Maybe this is a point of inflection. Maybe this is just my fevered imagination and bias confirmation surfacing again. Time will&amp;nbsp;tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1987 all over&amp;nbsp;again?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was working for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; Stock Exchange in October 1987. 
On the working day before the 1987 crash, the systems went down, because there had been very high winds, which had wreaked havoc with the telephone system (remember when this was important?). &amp;#8220;Telegraphic Transfers&amp;#8221; (as they were still called, although I think that Telex had replaced telegrams) failed, causing house sales to fail to settle (or &amp;#8220;complete&amp;#8221; in the jargon). 
The weird thing is that nobody seems very clear what caused the crash, or why the real economy wasn&amp;#8217;t really impacted at all. 
&lt;a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-culprits-of-the-1987-market-crash-remain-a-mystery-what-lessons-can-we-draw-from-it-now-51634112900"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; is about what we can learn from Black Monday of 1987, which as I have said, isn&amp;#8217;t very much.
The favoured explanation of the time was that &amp;#8220;portfolio insurance&amp;#8221; was to blame. 
This seemed to be accepted, but in retrospect, this seems very unlikely. It&amp;#8217;s not as though investors do not hedge themselves against a crash, and it&amp;#8217;s not as though gamma squeezes never happen.
I think what we can learn is that market crashes can come out of the&amp;nbsp;blue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1973 all over&amp;nbsp;again?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are stories of strikes hitting the news again. John Deere is the latest employer to be hit. 
There are stories of shortages of fuel and … well everything, but today zinc and over the last few months oil and gas.
There is a flattening yield curve, as central banks move to tighten at the short end of the curve.
Mini skirts and flared trousers are suddenly back in fashion. Well, I made that last one up, but it could&amp;nbsp;happen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Russian rouble&amp;nbsp;redux&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rt.com/russia/537407-putin-cnbc-dollar-inflation/"&gt;Putin is not a fan of the Fed.&lt;/a&gt;. He thinks that uncontrolled money printing will damage the dollar.
Emerging markets understand this stuff. Just look at the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Asian_financial_crisis"&gt;1997 East Asian financial crisis&lt;/a&gt;. They won&amp;#8217;t make the same mistake again but the dollar has &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorbitant_privilege"&gt;exorbitant privilege&lt;/a&gt;, right? So, nothing bad can happen to it: the dollar milk shake theory&amp;nbsp;survives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOS&lt;/span&gt; Starship&amp;nbsp;Enterprise!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/thats-what-this-starship-is-all-about/"&gt;Alex Manzara&amp;#8217;s post today&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the CBs are not being particularly vigilant, inflation expectations seem to be coming unmoored, and the market is close to taking matters into its own hands.  The Fed appears to be boxed in.  Crude oil this morning near a new high with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLX1&lt;/span&gt; trading up 95 cents at 81.39.  China’s Factory gate inflation “rose to a record on soaring commodity prices, but weak demand capped consumer inflation…” (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RTRS&lt;/span&gt;).  China &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PPI&lt;/span&gt; was +10.7%.  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PPI&lt;/span&gt; on tap for today expected +8.7% with Core&amp;nbsp;+7.1%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tullock&amp;nbsp;paradox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://robertreich.substack.com/p/why-the-hell-are-democrats-keeping?r=nmbt&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source="&gt;Robert Reich has written about how four Democrat elected members are sabotaging moderate attempts to control the cost of prescription drugs in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;
This reminds me of the Tullock Paradox: (&lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/economics" title="economics"&gt;economics&lt;/a&gt;) The apparent paradox that a &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rent_seeker" title="rent seeker"&gt;rent seeker&lt;/a&gt; wanting &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/political" title="political"&gt;political&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/favour" title="favour"&gt;favours&lt;/a&gt; can &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bribe" title="bribe"&gt;bribe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/politician" title="politician"&gt;politicians&lt;/a&gt; at a &lt;a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cost" title="cost"&gt;cost&lt;/a&gt; much lower than the value of the favour to the rent seeker. 
Although the politicians were given really quite modest bribes by Big Pharma, they are willing to sell their souls. 
It&amp;#8217;s as if they are not even pretending any more. 
Well, probably nobody knows, or cares. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; voters just know that drugs cost an insane sum, but that&amp;#8217;s what it takes to have a world-class health care system.
It&amp;#8217;s funny how, basically, the citizens of every country believe the same thing. 
It&amp;#8217;s as if it would be too painful to check the&amp;nbsp;facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stock of the day: Dorel&amp;nbsp;Industries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4459604-dorel-industries-stock-sports-business-sale"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; gives an overview of Dorel Industries. It&amp;#8217;s a boring company in a boring segment that survived a private equity bid earlier this year.
I don&amp;#8217;t know much about it, but it seems to have a plan to sell of its bicycle selling business and use the cash to reduce leverage.
It seems to have a significant level of family ownership (with A and B shares, presumably giving the family more&amp;nbsp;control).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has had a bit of visibility lately, which is probably good for the stock price. 
It&amp;#8217;s hard to say if it truly is a buy, but I&amp;#8217;d certainly prefer it to $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARKK&lt;/span&gt;. 
Maybe a pair strategy would work, but it&amp;#8217;d be hard to execute. 
Your call. I don&amp;#8217;t own any, but I am tempted to buy a few&amp;nbsp;shares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great number for new unemployment claims in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;. Equities, commodities, forex reacted as expected.
Bonds were barely affected. Presumably, the increased threat of inflation was exactly counterbalanced by the idea that with this rate of recovery the Fed is closer to the point of&amp;nbsp;taper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nat Gas, uranium and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; were hammered, the earlier two because they had got ahead of themselves, the latter because investors sold puts.&amp;nbsp;Presumably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Short squeezes&amp;nbsp;explained&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thelastbearstanding.substack.com/p/the-volatility-squeeze?r=nmbt&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source="&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent piece on why short squeezes happen.
Basically, it&amp;#8217;s that when a stock has been battered down, shorting it has limited upside and unlimited downside. 
Ultimately, this is due to the optionality embedded in a share price.
When you buy a stock, you get a call option on the assets of the company, with a strike price which is the amount of debt it has.
That&amp;#8217;s why companies which are insolvent (assets worth less that liabilities) still have&amp;nbsp;value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, read it as it&amp;#8217;s not only theoretically interesting but practically useful if you ever think about shorting something, especially via an outright &amp;#8216;naked&amp;#8217; short&amp;nbsp;sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What causes the gender pay&amp;nbsp;gap?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.capitalisnt.com/episodes/is-discrimination-still-causing-the-gender-pay-gap-with-claudia-goldin"&gt;It turns out that it&amp;#8217;s not discrimination&lt;/a&gt;. No, seriously. It&amp;#8217;s about greedy work, and substitutability of employees. Basically, women work in jobs where they can get cover if they a family emergency that needs them to take time off work. Men work in jobs where this is absent. 
Sometimes the same job changes along this dimension over time. Pharmacists are an example over the last fifty years. The result is that women are more represented among pharmacists, but their pay (or profits, from owning the shop) is&amp;nbsp;less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s always interesting to know what makes some jobs well paid vs others. I think this is something which is overlooked. It explains more than just the gender pay gap. Hedge fund managers are not substitutable, nor are Private Equity bosses. And they generally have enough influence over their firms that they are going to keep it that way. 
That&amp;#8217;s why doctors retained their right to practice independently, and didn&amp;#8217;t want to be swallowed up into the corporate maw, as engineers had been a few decades earlier. Corporations love&amp;nbsp;substitutability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve heard the theory that it&amp;#8217;s some sort of shared experience that means that new graduates entering major law firms and investment banks get paid eye-popping salaries. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DJ&lt;/span&gt; Sol, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; of Goldman Sachs, started his career doing the job of a junior analyst (I am guessing), whereas Jeff Bezos never worked picking items off a conveyor belt and packing them into boxes. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, maybe he did a bit, but he didn&amp;#8217;t start his career that way. I can see the argument, but I think that clients want consistency of team members, even juniors, when it comes to doing deals. Also, in the middle of a deal, even a relative junior might have some key knowledge that makes him valuable, and anyway, the recruitment process in these firms is a major undertaking: rather less so for  Amazon warehouse cannon&amp;nbsp;fodder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What causes increasing&amp;nbsp;inequality?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three things, the declining bargaining position of labour, the collapse of anti-trust enforcement, and the escalating political power of capital, &lt;a href="https://robertreich.substack.com/p/why-is-inequality-widening"&gt;according to Robert Reich&lt;/a&gt;. Arguably, the three are interlinked: big business has hobbled anti-trust, and have made unions fight with one hand tied behind their back (no wonder they have lost&amp;nbsp;membership).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is subtly different to gender discrimination, but it&amp;#8217;s related. A more democratic society would limit the power of CEOs to hijack remuneration committees. Just a&amp;nbsp;thought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What happens when the bank in Monopoly runs out of printed&amp;nbsp;money?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it prints some more, on any old bits of paper you have lying around.
&lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/chance-monopoly/"&gt;Alex M gives a more detailed explanation&lt;/a&gt; both of this aspect of the game, the need for the banker to keep his assets separate from that of the bank, and the origins of the game, which was in Great Depression era Germantown &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PA&lt;/span&gt;. Chance cards represent a decision of a player to go to Atlantic City to gamble what liquid resources he had left in the casino. Community Chest was a welfare organization in the&amp;nbsp;city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monopoly itself (the game, not the economic principle) was derived from another game, &lt;em&gt;The Landlord&amp;#8217;s Game&lt;/em&gt;, which was written to educate people about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism"&gt;Georgism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J Pow announces that tapering should start &lt;em&gt;this year&lt;/em&gt;. The markets were unfazed.
Equities didn&amp;#8217;t move much, neither did bonds.
Commodities were strong for the oil complex, and precious metals. 
The others were down, mainly.

&lt;h2&gt;We are discovering how inelastic demand for energy&amp;nbsp;is&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The very same voices who argued that investment in gas supply has to stop as a climate
policy tool now declare that it is inadequate gas supply rather than climate policy that is
responsible for skyrocketing prices. While the current market tightness is primarily due to a
robust demand it is a useful case study on how the economics of a supply restriction-driven
transition could unfold. A well-designed, demand-focused climate policy would lower gas
prices as better efficiency and renewables reduce gas demand. Trying to reduce consumption by restricting supply without changing the capital stock of heating systems and power
plants that determine demand would hit the microeconomic reality of inelastic demand: In
such a situation supply would have to be rationed by skyrocketing prices, leading to factory
closures, energy poverty risk for lower income families and similar consequences whose social acceptance remains to be seen. The current market situation should refocus the policy
conversation on reducing demand rather than artificially restricting&amp;nbsp;supply.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– Laszlo Varro, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VP&lt;/span&gt; Global Business Environment at&amp;nbsp;Shell&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never understood the idea that restricting funding for the production of fossil fuels would be the most effective way of saving the planet from&amp;nbsp;overheating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve tried to reduce the supply of drugs for best part of the last century, with the result that production increases endlessly while prices have dropped and consumption has endlessly increased. Not from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; or Western Europe, but from labs in China, opium fields in Afghanistan and coco leaf farms across Latin&amp;nbsp;America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I think we are about to find out exactly how inelastic demand is. Fossil fuel prices have been going up for a month or two now, and they do not seem to be turning down. Gas is the most high profile case, but now that is so expensive coal fired power stations are being put back into service as the lowest cost base load generation. I&amp;#8217;ll refrain from making any comments on the ability of politicians and celebrity central bankers to understand&amp;nbsp;economics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/10/teachers-pay-countries-salaries-education/"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; shows that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; is lamentably behind the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OECD&lt;/span&gt; in the way it pays teachers. Of course, a simple mean actual salary doesn&amp;#8217;t really capture the subtleties of how teachers are paid by subject, location, performance or seniority. 
My suspicions are that we allocate pay inefficiently along these axes, at least in terms of maximizing pupil performance, but this is not based on any hard&amp;nbsp;evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#8217;m reluctant to quote anything from the Davos Illuminati, but this seems a perfectly reasonable and factual&amp;nbsp;account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deficits: done to&amp;nbsp;death&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I get it. You&amp;#8217;ve read a thousand articles about why the deficit matters, and another thousand about why it doesn&amp;#8217;t. Well, &lt;a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/why-do-people-worry-about-deficits?r=nmbt&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source="&gt;read this one&lt;/a&gt; because it&amp;#8217;s almost balanced. (I think it leans more to the &amp;#8220;&amp;#8216;deficits don&amp;#8217;t matter&amp;#8221; pole, but it at least doesn&amp;#8217;t rubbish the opposing&amp;nbsp;view.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noah Smith is another excellent free blog. Free as in you don&amp;#8217;t have to pay money to read it. Money as in a $1 trillion platinum coin minted by the&amp;nbsp;Treasury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Facebook, regulation and Frances&amp;nbsp;Haugen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/the-facebook-whistleblower-is-heroic?r=nmbt&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source="&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; by Matt Stoller nails it. Regulation is exactly what Facebook wants. 
I won&amp;#8217;t go as far as to say that Haugen is actually still working, covertly, for Facebook, but I do agree totally that regulating &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FB&lt;/span&gt; would entrench the company in its dominant position until the next major tech innovation comes along which renders the web as we know it&amp;nbsp;obsolete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All big business wants more regulation in its sector. Regulation is the deep and enduring moat that keeps out competition for startups. It creates an artificial economy of scale that would otherwise not&amp;nbsp;exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Global Tax Deal is good news for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; and for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; but for the RoW … not so&amp;nbsp;much!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, you guessed it. &lt;a href="https://www.taxwatchuk.org/a_fair_distribution/"&gt;A new tax favours the largest companies and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; relative to the current tax arrangements&lt;/a&gt;.
This deal has had very little coverage in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSM&lt;/span&gt;. I wonder&amp;nbsp;why!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stock of the&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KOS&lt;/span&gt; (Kosmos Energy) is not a stock for the faint-hearted. It is an oil and gas exploration company, with operations in Africa and the Americas. 
It has been beaten down, as it is chronically cash-flow negative, even though it has had strong and largely growing revenue because of large capital expenditures (these firms are addicted to spending capex). However, it has very strong technicals (for those investors who also believe in astrology), and it&amp;#8217;s in a sector that is glowing red-hot. Do your own research (Seeking Alpha is probably a good place to&amp;nbsp;start). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A side effect of the capex is a very generous-looking price to book (nearly 3x). Valuing a company that may have &amp;#8220;stranded assets&amp;#8221; is a leap of faith, but that&amp;#8217;s what the accountants&amp;nbsp;think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy was hot. Bonds were cold. Equities were cold. The dollar was&amp;nbsp;weak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rant of the&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just in case you felt that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s role as a facilitator of global kleptocracy and corruption, take a look at &lt;a href="https://www.transparency.org.uk/pandora-papers-latest-news-leak-british-virgin-islands-UK-property"&gt;this story&lt;/a&gt; from Transparency International. The ruling family of Azerbaijan seem to have purchased £400 million of property in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; over the last 15 years. Admittedly, this is small beer compared to an estimated total of £5 billion of such transactions over the same period across all foreign&amp;nbsp;agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Image of the&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;EVs are the lard arses of the&amp;nbsp;road&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="319c459460ed8102701a3f2ded7f7dee.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/319c459460ed8102701a3f2ded7f7dee.png"&gt;
Most EVs weigh in excess of two tonnes. 
In comparison, the kerb weight of the old Renault 4 (admittedly, a flimsy car) could be as low at 600kg, 30% of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EV&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s weight. It doesn&amp;#8217;t make sense to …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;1&amp;nbsp;Oct&lt;/h1&gt;

In comparison, the kerb weight of the old Renault 4 (admittedly, a flimsy car) could be as low at 600kg, 30% of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EV&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s weight. It doesn&amp;#8217;t make sense to me, if one is concerned about saving the planet, to  expend the energy to move in such a massive lump of machinery and battery around the&amp;nbsp;countryside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="2730aaa84fedfdfa50f2cf7e95824926.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/2730aaa84fedfdfa50f2cf7e95824926.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to the chart, it&amp;#8217;s interesting that several of the Tesla&amp;#8217;s models are absolutely terrible in terms of miles per kg of&amp;nbsp;battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inflation is spiking so sell bonds,&amp;nbsp;right?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, wrong: all that cash from equity investors liquidating their portfolios has got to go somewhere, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasuries are the world&amp;#8217;s only safe asset. Especially the only safe asset that actually pays  a positive return, even if it is only 1.4%. And anyway, since it&amp;#8217;s the perfect collateral, a suitable level of gearing can turn that 1.4% into 14% for an investor with enough …&amp;nbsp;savvy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be the last wrap from me for a week. 
Basically, today was a risk-on day. 
Last month was &amp;#8216;the worst ever&amp;#8217; (because &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; declined by a few percent), but now October is &amp;#8216;the best ever&amp;#8217; (but maybe only today, as funds allocate their new inflows to risk assets). 
The usual constellation was found: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; down, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USDJPY&lt;/span&gt; down, equities up, commodities up, even bonds up (a tiny bit).
Chamath is getting into trouble, as it emerges he sold all his $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; holdings before telling his followers to hold as it was going up 3X. 
Crazy Cathie is still pumping, but her &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARKK&lt;/span&gt; is not available for shorting.
Merck ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MRK&lt;/span&gt;) announced it had an oral drug which has been found to be effective against Covid, which pushed up its stock price and depressed those of $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MRNA&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PFE&lt;/span&gt;.
Nearly all energy stocks were up. 
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIDE&lt;/span&gt; was down &amp;gt; 18%, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;APRN&lt;/span&gt; continued its wild ride (up &amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;10%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBP&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pound has been cratering lately.
The current account is terrible (?&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBP&lt;/span&gt; 110 B, ~ 5% of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;), the budget deficit is worse (14% of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;). The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; is not the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;: it&amp;#8217;s currency is not a reserve currency, it doesn&amp;#8217;t export any oil, or …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;30&amp;nbsp;Sept&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBP&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pound has been cratering lately.

The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; is not the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;: it&amp;#8217;s currency is not a reserve currency, it doesn&amp;#8217;t export any oil, or have significant reserves relative to its own consumption.
It looks pretty weak. These things haven&amp;#8217;t mattered for a while, but things can often be ignored by the markets until they&amp;nbsp;aren&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The added complication is that both the Bank of England and the Treasury seem hell bent on making things worse. The Bank is reluctant to keep buying gilts, the Treasury is looking at tightening fiscal policy, because … &amp;#8220;sound&amp;nbsp;money&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economy has a terrible supply problem at the moment, which has caused inflation to spike, which has no doubt spurred the Bank into action, but it&amp;#8217;s likely that the general hangover from post-pandemic spending, plus the Treasury cutting spending and increasing taxes (some already announced, like increased taxes on dividends and increases in National Insurance (a payroll tax by any other name) is going to tip the country over the edge, in my&amp;nbsp;view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of factors affecting exchange rates, and a monetary tightening might be expected to strengthen &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBP&lt;/span&gt;, but only if it is greater than in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; (for the rates against &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;). This doesn&amp;#8217;t much matter in the short run, anyway.
The main problem is that safe assets, for the whole planet, are denominated in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;, so demand for this currency will be strong, which will exacerbate the&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said all that, I acknowledge that forecasting currency movements is a mug&amp;#8217;s game, you would probably best avoiding any kind of speculation on this currency pair; not that this should be taken as advice of any&amp;nbsp;sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took Brent Donnelly&amp;#8217;s Spectra Market&amp;#8217;s daily newsletter as a starting point for this&amp;nbsp;rant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IBM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Josh Young has written a piece on Seeking Alpha arguing that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IBM&lt;/span&gt; will never be able to make the sorts of investments that might allow it to challenge the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt;.
The argument is that it&amp;#8217;s commitment to dividends is depleting its free cash flow so much that it will eventually run out of&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the full thesis &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4457656-ibm-is-a-melting-ice-cube"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Let them heat their homes with carbon&amp;nbsp;offsets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2021/09/29/will-esg-create-the-next-lehman-moment/"&gt;Kuppy tells it like it is.&lt;/a&gt;
He is all in on fossil fuels.
The thesis is strong, but the world&amp;#8217;s massed central bankers may be stronger.
It&amp;#8217;s an interesting battle to watch. There will be collateral&amp;nbsp;damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since I can remember, billionaires have been taking private jets to conclaves where they strategized on how to reduce other people’s carbon emissions. At the time, I thought little of it—billionaires need hobbies and all. Besides, true billionaire credentials are gained when a squadron of luxury jets arrives to lecture some impoverished country on why they don’t deserve electricity. It is as cringeworthy as Marie Antoinette advising starving Parisians to eat cake since they couldn’t afford bread. Then again, part of being a billionaire is proving how tone-deaf you can be, while getting away with it. Boys will be&amp;nbsp;boys…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Tether goes full&amp;nbsp;Ponzi&amp;#8221;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/tether-goes-full-ponzi"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; read. It reminds us that Tether is a Ponzi, but, well, nobody wants to sell while they are making good money out of it. 
The story of the original Ponzi is fascinating, and is summarized in the article.
The guy just looked the part too:
&lt;img alt="Wouldn't you want this guy to invest your savings for you?" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8d4fd017-a525-47b3-963d-112011ecb89a_546x705.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Doomberg is worth a follow, so&amp;nbsp;enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is the quarter-end. To add to the usual noise, there will be some realizing of profits and crystallizing of losses.
The brinkmanship over the debt ceiling is going on: it seems inconceivable to me that it&amp;#8217;s anything more than certain representatives holding out so they can sell their vote for the highest possible price. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; economy is not going to collapse because a bunch of politicians are playing hard to get, over a act of political theatre which is not even a feature of any other democracy. Supposedly, Congress will pass a bill to delay the day of reckoning until 3&amp;nbsp;Dec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities ground higher, in spite of the dollar remaining at elevated levels (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt;=94.2, down 13bp from yesterday though). Energy commodities of all stripes were up. Russian energy stocks, like $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNGS&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROSN&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GAZP&lt;/span&gt; have had a stunning run. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LKOH&lt;/span&gt; was down 1%. If the dollar strengthens, emerging market oil stocks should have a double-strength tailwind, as long as they are bought on the local exchange. &lt;em&gt;Not investment&amp;nbsp;advice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging markets were under strain: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MXY&lt;/span&gt; was up 57bp.
Bonds were down, but only 1.2bp on the 10Y&amp;nbsp;yield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; was up, 29bp, the other &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; indices down. No great vote of confidence from the bulls, but presumably the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; continue to be seen as safe haven stocks, in spite of&amp;nbsp;valuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;APRN&lt;/span&gt;, Blue Apron bounced, up 15%, after being beaten down for a long&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;THG&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LSE&lt;/span&gt; is looking very, very sick. To me it looks like a pyramid scheme, but do your own research because I sure haven&amp;#8217;t done&amp;nbsp;mine.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Priced for perfection, poised for panic</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/priced-for-perfection-poised-for-panic.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-09-29T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:39:00+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-09-29:/priced-for-perfection-poised-for-panic.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;29&amp;nbsp;Sep&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Markets&amp;nbsp;position&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; equity markets are mostly at or near all time highs. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; P/E ratio is around 31, according to something I read, although measuring this is probably tricky as headline earnings are almost never &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GAAP&lt;/span&gt; now, but &amp;#8220;adjusted.&amp;#8221; It seems hard to believe …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;29&amp;nbsp;Sep&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Markets&amp;nbsp;position&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; equity markets are mostly at or near all time highs. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; P/E ratio is around 31, according to something I read, although measuring this is probably tricky as headline earnings are almost never &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GAAP&lt;/span&gt; now, but &amp;#8220;adjusted.&amp;#8221; It seems hard to believe that monetary conditions will get any looser, with inflation running at double target, even with the opaque &amp;#8220;average inflation targetting&amp;#8221; that the Fed endlessly uses to justify delay in tightening. Although we are near all-time highs, with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; dropping 2.5% on the odd day recently, momentum is faltering.
We&amp;#8217;ve probably been here before, but it feels different this time (as it always&amp;nbsp;does).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consensus forecasts by analysts have been breaking records. But, for me, analyst forecasts are really backward looking. A sell-side guy never wants to spook the buy-side clients of his employer, so is always looking at the world through rose-coloured glasses. It&amp;#8217;s easy to beat estimates by 20% when your company has been in hibernation for a year. Continuing to do so when all your costs, from labour to raw materials, are&amp;nbsp;rocketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labour is a particular problem. There is a big churn in the labour market. Many people are quitting (or not coming back from furlough), and others have discovered that when they change jobs they get a much better salary uplift than when they soldier on. As &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; slows, but labour costs continue to rise, this will squeeze margins and depress&amp;nbsp;stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No new oil&amp;nbsp;projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://carbontracker.org/reports/adapt-to-survive/?mc_cid=328d1d532b"&gt;This report&lt;/a&gt; says that if govts. are serious about controlling rising temperatures, a lot of oil and gas reserves will be &amp;#8220;stranded.&amp;#8221; 
The chart shows most of the major oil producers. 
It&amp;#8217;s interesting that Pioneer and Aramco have almost all their reserves still developable under the 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IEA&lt;/span&gt; Sustainable Development Scenario (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SDS&lt;/span&gt;) but the vast bulk of Ecopetrols reserves could not be developed ever, under this scenario.
(Ecopetrol? me neither.) 
Anyway, it&amp;#8217;s an interesting angle on these development companies. 
Devon, Petrobas, Hess, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNRL&lt;/span&gt; all look well positioned from this&amp;nbsp;perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Debt&amp;nbsp;Ceiling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; is a foreign country. 
They do things differently there.
The idea of having a ceiling on the total amount of debt outstanding is a familiar one.
The laughably named &amp;#8220;Growth and Stability Pact&amp;#8221; that throttled growth and created instability is a case in point.
But at least the debt limit in it didn&amp;#8217;t create a sudden death date, and scenes of civil servants being sent home on unpaid leave.
It&amp;#8217;s insane, but yet another political cudgel, this time used by the Republicans to bash Biden.
Politics really is the ugly game, played by ugly&amp;nbsp;players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Electric&amp;nbsp;machines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$F, Ford is doing well. 
It&amp;#8217;s making lots of electric vehicles now. 
I would have thought that a short $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;/ long $F pairs trade might be&amp;nbsp;interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What ever happened to&amp;nbsp;ideology?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite podcasts is &lt;a href="https://www.capitalisnt.com"&gt;Capitalisnt&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ve been a fan of Luigi Zingales for a long time, but his co-host Bethany McLean is the perfect foil.
They are not ideological, but they are analytical. 
They had &lt;a href="https://www.capitalisnt.com/episodes/why-capitalism-isnt-without-democracy"&gt;a repeat episode&lt;/a&gt; this week, which you might even be able to listen to embedded in this&amp;nbsp;page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe height="200px" width="100%" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless src="https://player.simplecast.com/bf3fe997-c135-43ea-902c-0fcfdd6995bf?dark=false"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The format for this particular episode is unusual, in that there is no guest invited on to advocate for a particular point of view. The two hosts discuss how important democracy to allow capitalism to function. Zingales&amp;#8217; position is that it is absolutely critical because, as he says, it puts the whole citizenry in the position of the referee, so that attempts to bribe the referee (what happens in almost every society, autocratic or not) leave the public better off. Of course, &amp;#8216;the public&amp;#8217; here might be just a &amp;#8216;winning coalition&amp;#8217; in the jargon of selectorate theory, but that&amp;#8217;s a lot better than just a few&amp;nbsp;oligarchs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Zingales is far from being an ideologue, he suggests that the capture of the Democrats and Republicans in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; by the plutocrats is partly the result of the end of ideology following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Interestingly, he pointed out that in his native country, Italy, when communists were elected to government they tended to be squeaky clean, because of the distaste for venality that their ideology gave&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Headhunter&amp;nbsp;Group&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t really associate Russia with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; excellence, but actually it has a few pretty strong firms. Yandex, Mail.Ru, and (I know realize) Headhunter Group (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HHR&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAQ&lt;/span&gt;). The price action of $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HHR&lt;/span&gt; has been nothing short of spectacular.
There is very good &lt;a href="https://macro-ops.com/headhunter-hhr-one-of-the-best-network-effect-businesses-ive-ever-seen/"&gt;write up by Brandon at Macro Ops&lt;/a&gt;.
Russia is a kleptocracy, but kleptocrats need stonks to go up too, so I think that this one might be worth&amp;nbsp;tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was an odd sort of day. Quite a few equity markets recovered from yesterday&amp;#8217;s weakness, but Far Eastern exchanges were weak.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AUD&lt;/span&gt; was weak, and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; dollar was strong, indicating a macro-level risk off sentiment.
Nat gas crashed 7%, but most other hydrocarbon energy commodities were up.
Bonds seem unfazed, although this might be an illusion, with inflation fears exactly offsetting the flight to fixed income that would normally be seen with a 0.7% jump in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBP&lt;/span&gt; was down 0.9% vs &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;. 
Gilts will struggle in this kind of environment. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; is running a trade deficit of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBP&lt;/span&gt; 60 B per year. That is going to weigh heavily on the currency, and a weak pound is incompatible with low gilt yields. The forecast for the current account is for it to get much worse: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBP&lt;/span&gt; 22.6 B quarterly. Somehow the forecasts are for Sterling to remain fairly&amp;nbsp;flat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precious metals were weak. The momentum is endlessly down. At some point gold will catch a bid, but for the moment everyone is dumping it for bitcoins. 
Oh, well &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; was down 0.3% vs &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;, but still up 40% on the&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Image&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What Kaplan did&amp;nbsp;next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What Kaplan did&amp;nbsp;next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="[https://wallstreetonparade.com/2021/09/robert-kaplan-was-trading-like-a-hedge-fund-kingpin-for-five-years-while-president-of-the-boston-fed-a-dozen-legal-safeguards-failed-to-stop-him/](https://wallstreetonparade.com/2021/09/robert-kaplan-was-trading-like-a-hedge-fund-kingpin-for-five-years-while-president-of-the-boston-fed-a-dozen-legal-safeguards-failed-to-stop-him/)"&gt;Wall St on Parade has done a thorough job of eviscerating Rob Kaplan.&lt;/a&gt; To quote Ben Hunt, they are not even pretending any more. It just seems insane that someone in his position was trading futures, in large size, while being in possession of inside information. Not just some tit bits of gossip. The actual decision making of the Federal Reserve, the institution whose actions have more impact on the prices of global assets than any other, by at least an order of magnitude. But, of course, he did nothing against the rules. It&amp;#8217;s just the rules that were insane. And, presumably, still are. Unless you think hard about for whose benefit they were&amp;nbsp;drafted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Road Ahead&lt;/em&gt; is a rocky one, for Sir&amp;nbsp;Keir&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just skimmed &lt;a href="https://fabians.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Road-Ahead-KEIR-STARMER_web.pdf"&gt;The Road Ahead&lt;/a&gt; by Keir Starmer.
It&amp;#8217;s a Fabian essay by the leader of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; Labour Party.
Lots of people have been very rude about it.
I think the best line was &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ve read the document. It looks like the Sermon on the Mount written by a focus group, to be honest,&amp;#8221; by John&amp;nbsp;McDonnell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know who it was written for, or what it was expected to achieve.
It has a list of principles, which do seem pretty wishy washy. The first is &lt;em&gt;We will always put hard-working families and their priorities first.&lt;/em&gt; 
I am not sure what the governments existing set of priorities are, or even whether there is official list, and what exactly having such a list would mean, in terms of actual actions and laws. 
The principle implies that hard-working families should be given a higher priority than those who work less hard. A hard working member of a lazy family might feel discriminated against. I am sure that hedge fund general partners work incredibly hard: do they and their families get priority over the feckless and indolent?
What if if the top priority of most hard-working families is to elect a Conservative&amp;nbsp;government? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that politicians always shy away from actually announcing what they will do. I get it that they much prefer to talk about existing problems, and how if they get elected they will take action to solve them, without being at all explicit as to how they will go about this task. 
We all largely agree on what we want, so making statements of this sort minimizes alienation. Almost all actual policy choices create winners and losers, but losers care much more about losing than winners care about winning.
Voters are much more convinced that the downside of change will affect them than that the upside&amp;nbsp;will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure that Sir Keir is a nice chap and jolly clever to boot, but this document is unlikely to persuade anyone that he&amp;#8217;s worth voting for.
Labour, like every party, needs a sloganeering extrovert who can connect with the electorate. It probably helps not to think too deeply about policy matters, but you have to be sincere or, like Tony Blair, be able to fake sincerity&amp;nbsp;convincingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One disappointing aspect of the essay was that it was devoid of anything that could be said to be economic policy. It talked about inequality, about how it was so expensive to buy a house now. But there was no mention of the central bank policies that have resulted in this situation and whether a new government would change the BoE mandate in a way which would reduce inequality. Although it was not universally popular, Jeremy Corbyn did propose a land value&amp;nbsp;tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angela Rayner has survived an attempt by Keir to remove her from contention as a contender to be the next leader. Even with his changes to the party constitution, I think she still has a chance. I have no idea what she stands for, but eventually people will vote for someone completely different. Well, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; electorate got such a person in the shape of Donald Trump. Sometimes change is not for the&amp;nbsp;best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J Powell is testifying before the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Senate. He seems to have said that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; economy had met the tests to permit the Fed to begin tapering (i.e. reducing the $120B per month net purchases of bonds: not actual reducing aggregate assets). 
This sent the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; down nearly 3%. 
What happens if the Fed actually started to sell bonds is hard to know. 
Even wondering about the question feels like asking about a state of the world that can never&amp;nbsp;exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar spiked, to 93.7 (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt;). This knocked all commodities down, except iron ore, which jumped from a very low level, possibly because of signs of China stimulus&amp;nbsp;measures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evergrande bounced a bit, presumably on hopes that the China govt. will not let it fail. It met coupon payments on its &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; bonds (having missed them on at least some of its dollar bonds last week). This seems a sketchy justification for getting bullish on iron ore again, but maybe it&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; were all down, at least the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; members. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BABA&lt;/span&gt; was up: presumably Jack Ma has licked Xi&amp;#8217;s boots for sufficiently&amp;nbsp;long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond yields were all up, as one would expect with demand for bonds dropping (yields up, bond prices down). Central banks now are nearly always by far the biggest buyers of their governments&amp;#8217;&amp;nbsp;bonds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Image&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Transparency International and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transparency International maintains a league table of corruption.

&lt;h2&gt;Transparency International and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transparency International maintains a league table of corruption.
It&amp;#8217;s the the sort of league table one doesn&amp;#8217;t want one&amp;#8217;s home country to be at the top of.
To be fair, there are many countries which are less transparent than the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;.
But there seems to be a steady trickle of stories about the close relationship between tax policy setting and the Big Three (Four?) accountancy firms here in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;.
The argument is that corporate taxation is a complex topic, because the income of a bundle of contracts is hard to define. I have a sneaky suspicion that the best approach is to not tax corporations at all, but to tax the various end-investors and stakeholders that themselves derive income from the corporation. 
Probably a step too far, although Corporation Tax as it exists now was introduced only in the 1960s (by Jim Callaghan). 
Anyway, it&amp;#8217;s very depressing to see the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; mentioned repeatedly in &lt;a href="https://images.transparencycdn.org/images/2021-Report-The-right-incentives-The-risks-of-undue-influence-in-tax-policy.pdf"&gt;the latest Transparency International Report&lt;/a&gt;.
Quite a few of the incidents are old, and it may be that the worst abuses are in the past, but the incentives for corporations to lobby for extra complexity, and the concomitant loopholes remains incredibly strong. 
The recent increase in the marginal rate of tax serves only to increase that&amp;nbsp;incentive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least &lt;a href="https://stephensemler.substack.com/p/house-dems-who-voted-against-pentagon"&gt;we are not as bad as the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a low bar to be&amp;nbsp;sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The reserve bank of&amp;nbsp;Scotland&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland does not have a central bank. But it could have, and if it did &lt;a href="https://www.reservebank.scot/#gsc.tab=0"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; would be what its website would look like. The bank would issue a new currency: the Scottish Pound.
Commentators on the left and the right have been arguing for a separate currency for Scotland for decades. Tim Ridout is the latest. He has done a lot of work to anticipate the objections to those who will argue against it.
It will be a strain, for sure, bit it&amp;#8217;s not obviously a stupid idea. 
Listen to &lt;a href="https://pileusmmt.libsyn.com/114-tim-rideout-the-scottish-reserve-bank"&gt;this episode&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; Podcast to find out more.
As a Welshman, I could not help wondering if Wales might be galvanized by having its own currency.
I think it might help, but there are more practical actions to take first.
Although monetary policy can do a lot of damage, I think that its power to affect the real economy is fairly limited. 
Back in the distant past, politicians were always talking about &amp;#8220;the supply side.&amp;#8221;
I think that it&amp;#8217;s time they started again. 
We cannot eat pounds, Scottish or&amp;nbsp;British.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Worth a&amp;nbsp;look&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.netinterest.co/p/price-comparison-websites-go-compare-5fc"&gt;Why price comparison websites may have had their day&lt;/a&gt;. Great article that explains the economics of the business. Interestingly, more and more ad spending goes to&amp;nbsp;Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.taxwatchuk.org/g7_tax_deal/"&gt;Big Tech wins with repeal of digital service tax&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; has been strongly arguing for scrapping of the Digital Service Tax, because, well, lobbying. 
It looks like all that money funnelled from Google to various member of Congress did the&amp;nbsp;trick!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thebearcave.substack.com/p/the-bear-cave-84-41e"&gt;A new Bear Cave newsletter is out.&lt;/a&gt;
Interesting as always. Might be worth looking at $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WIMI&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DATS&lt;/span&gt; as shorts.
Do your own&amp;nbsp;research!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://moontowermeta.com/the-r-word/"&gt;A good post on planning for retirement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/the-villains-behind-our-medical-supply"&gt;Matt Stoller explains yet another reason why &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; medical treatment is so expensive&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s a long post, but it is about the fact that it&amp;#8217;s much easier to make profits by bribing purchasing managers than by competing on price.
The corruption, in which hospital chief executives are literally given a share of the profits made by suppliers to their own hospitals is egregious, but&amp;nbsp;explicable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/is-the-fed-quietly-preparing-for-an-evergrande-tsunami-202109270046"&gt;Evegrande may be the fuse to a new Minsky moment.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TBH&lt;/span&gt;, I don&amp;#8217;t fully understand this, but it seems to be saying that there is a huge, global scramble for actual balances at the Fed., because banks can&amp;#8217;t keep track of who owns what collateral. I bet J Powell wishes his re-appointment could be brought forward by a few&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weak equities, flat bonds, strong dollar, weak gold, strong oil. Generally risk off.
Gilts were hit hard(ish): 10Y yield up to 8.6%, 3bp&amp;nbsp;rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Living without&amp;nbsp;working&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-ways-men-live-without-working-in-america-092147068.html"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; runs through a number of explanations of how &lt;span class="caps"&gt;30MM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; American men can live without being in the formal workforce.
There is nothing very extraordinary about the ways: basically, the black economy is probably bigger than you think, and quite a few people got rich enough to live off savings. Plus quite a few are in prison: this is the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; and those private prison company dividends aren&amp;#8217;t going to pay themselves. It&amp;#8217;d be ironic if some economically inactive men were living off dividend income generated from payment to CoreCivic ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CXW&lt;/span&gt;) by taxpayers who generally are working. But it&amp;#8217;d also be impossible, because $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CXW&lt;/span&gt; is levered to the gills and can&amp;#8217;t afford to pay a dividend, but I guess it probably has issued some very high-yield debt so maybe&amp;nbsp;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CXW&lt;/span&gt; was a Kuppy pick. The (cynical) thesis was that Biden would actually end up locking up a lot more men than Trump ever did. It hasn&amp;#8217;t happened yet, but never say&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;never.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yellow&amp;nbsp;submarines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French are very, very sore about losing the submarine contract.
Maybe it wasn&amp;#8217;t a contract, or maybe it was a contract but it hadn&amp;#8217;t yet been signed, maybe it had been signed, but by only one of the parties, maybe it was only an understanding.
But overall, France is furious. 
&lt;a href="https://atlantico.fr/article/decryptage/s-il-n-y-avait-que-les-sous-marins-vendus-a-l-australie------radioscopie-des-abus-de-position-dominante-commis-au-quotidien-par-les-etats-unis-joe-biden-industrie-entreprises-franck-decloquement-loik-le-floch-prigent"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; goes into detail. It doesn&amp;#8217;t even mention the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, which barely has a walk-on role in this drama, whatever the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; govt. spin says. 
Like most countries, France views the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; with extreme distrust, and resents its dominance spying. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; likes to think of itself as the leader of the free world. The free world, I think, sees the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; as an abusive patriarch which is in decline but still has enough economic power to force it into cooperating, at least for the time being.
For what it&amp;#8217;s worth, I think China is a hundred times worse, but I&amp;#8217;m not sure that there are many countries that still prefer the devil they know. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; is one, for sure, because of the historical ties and &amp;#8220;Anglo Saxon&amp;#8221; shared heritage. 
For most of the world, this is not a&amp;nbsp;factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/european-leaders-to-blame-for-subordination-to-america-by-yanis-varoufakis-2021-09"&gt;Vanis Varoufakis argues that the submarine fiasco is entirely the result of an unwillingness of the European elites to give up their influence on national governments.&lt;/a&gt;
I think he has a&amp;nbsp;point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Evergrande&amp;nbsp;update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evergrande seems to have dodged a bullet yesterday and made a coupon payment on a dollar bond.
I think a lot of high-yield dollar ETFs have exposure to those bonds, so the argument that mostly this is an internal matter for China is not entirely persuasive.
Anyway, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f858fe4a-716e-49ee-bebe-45c810b0d7a6"&gt;Robert Armstrong as a good take on the matter&lt;/a&gt;.
I&amp;#8217;d love to short Evergrande &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; co, maybe even the banks with exposure to it, but the whole show is stage managed by the Chinese state, so any position would be really a bet on how one expects Xi Jin Ping to behave, which is well outside my expertise.
Obviously, in the long run, it will all end in ruins, but we all know what happens in the long&amp;nbsp;run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Forex&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forex used to be the most volatile tradeable asset class of all. Now it&amp;#8217;s flat and dull and untradeable, at least to me.
I recently signed up to Brent Donnelly&amp;#8217;s daily macro newsletter &lt;a href="https://www.spectramarkets.com/blog-insights/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. 
I don&amp;#8217;t know much about him, but he seems to make sense. 
He is quite bearish on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AUD&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBP&lt;/span&gt; (in spite of the BoE being about to raise rates). His newletter today (pdf, not linkable) points out how insanely unbalanced asset markets are in China, with housing as an asset being eight or so times the size of stocks or bonds. In the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;, stocks, bonds &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; housing are fairly balanced, with housing the smallest at 200 trillion yuan, stocks at 280. (Why yuan? That&amp;#8217;s what the chart is&amp;nbsp;in.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tullow&amp;nbsp;Oil&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tullow Oil is leveraged to the hilt, has barely any operational assets, has a management that spends most of its time worrying about how to make the next coupon payment. It&amp;#8217;s the sort of company that a serious investor would run a mile from.
But sometimes shitcos are the ones that make investors rich. 
As any of the Apes who invest in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMC&lt;/span&gt; or Gamestop.
Oil is on a tear (and &lt;a href="https://thefelderreport.com/2021/09/22/is-oil-about-to-breakout-of-its-long-term-downtrend/"&gt;Jesse Felder believes it&amp;#8217;s going higher&lt;/a&gt;).
Africa is the&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not an analyst, but I can at least tell that the company is not burning cash. 
I think it might be worth a second look. Obviously, take professional advice before&amp;nbsp;investing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Facebook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t like Facebook at all.
To me, Zuck &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Sheryl are evil incarnate.
&lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/lawsuit-alleges-facebook-paid-49-billion-to-protect-zuckerberg"&gt;The news&lt;/a&gt; that corporate governance at the company is not what it should be was not, to me a great revelation. It&amp;#8217;s hard to believe that it came as a great shock to Wall St.
The share price, oddly, has been going down.
It&amp;#8217;s hard to believe that the present value of any future income stream from holding the stock can ever justify its valuation, but that has held more-or-less since the stock was listed, so it&amp;#8217;s hard to think it&amp;#8217;s a good basis for action.
Having been burned far too many times, I want to keep well away.
But if the downturn does not reverse, one wonders if stonks like $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;, which also have shockingly bad corp. governance, might also start to&amp;nbsp;sag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Climate change: the perfect cover for any political&amp;nbsp;failure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climate is changing. It has always changed. We (as a species) have probably made a difference to the rate.
As the climate changes, we&amp;#8217;ll have to adapt.
We might be able to change our economies so that the part of the change that&amp;#8217;s down to us is less. 
But its not that easy. And sometimes we don&amp;#8217;t adapt quickly enough, through incompetence or malice, &lt;a href="https://www.realclearenergy.org/articles/2021/09/22/climate_change_ate_my_homework_politicians_blame_climate_change_for_bureaucratic_failures_795507.html"&gt;as in New York&lt;/a&gt;.
I am not a &amp;#8216;denier.&amp;#8217; But I&amp;#8217;m not a fan of Greta either. 
We should take a scientific approach, not a religious one. 
Those who argue that &amp;#8216;the science is settled&amp;#8217; are more like member of a cult than rationalists, to me,&amp;nbsp;anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no issue with writers like &lt;a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/climate-optimism-of-the-will?r=nmbt&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=copy"&gt;Noah Smith&lt;/a&gt; who take the view that action on climate change is urgent, but that it&amp;#8217;s still possible to avert&amp;nbsp;disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The debt&amp;nbsp;ceiling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is pretty incomprehensible to us non-Americans. 
If parliament is sovereign, and has agreed on plans for taxing and spending, then why should an arbitrary limit on the aggregated debt level stop those plans being put into action. 
Does &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; other country have such a&amp;nbsp;system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Origins of Grand Theft&amp;nbsp;Auto&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Dundee got the&amp;nbsp;edge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clive Sinclair was credited with revolutionising home computing in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; and kick-starting the British video games industry with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZX&lt;/span&gt; Spectrum in the 1980s. But his influence was especially pronounced in Dundee, where Sinclair sub-contracted the Spectrum&amp;#8217;s manufacture to the city&amp;#8217;s watchmaking factory,&amp;nbsp;Timex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its peak, Timex was producing a new computer every four seconds – but not all of them made it to market. Some happened to find their way into the hands of light-fingered staff, who then moved them on cheap to their pals. This meant that, even with rampant unemployment elsewhere in the city, Dundee homes were still awash with&amp;nbsp;Spectrums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With nothing much else to do during the dole-dependent early 80s, coding games really caught on and the city consequently became a massive video game development hub. One that would later give the world a multi-billion dollar crime-flavoured franchise in the form of&amp;#8230; Grand Theft&amp;nbsp;Auto. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Collapse in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;lending&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various reflation skeptics, such as Lacy Hunt, Harley Bassman, Jeff Snider have been saying that inflation is going to crater.

&lt;h2&gt;Collapse in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;lending&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various reflation skeptics, such as Lacy Hunt, Harley Bassman, Jeff Snider have been saying that inflation is going to crater. 
As I blogged a while ago, the increasing inequality in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; and elsewhere has caused the propensity to spend to plummet. 
In my day job, I&amp;#8217;ve been trying to borrow, and even for a (private) company with a  balance sheet which is as solid as a rock, the longer-term rate I was quoted was a spread of ~5% above &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LIBOR&lt;/span&gt;. 
To me, this tells me that nobody wants to lend to such a company. Presumably, they&amp;#8217;d prefer to buy gilts at&amp;nbsp;85bp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I thought I&amp;#8217;d check out exactly bad things are. Well, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FRED&lt;/span&gt; told me, and I think it&amp;#8217;s pretty bad.
- [ ] 
You can take a closer look &lt;a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=H0Cz"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; but the chart below clearly shows that although this trend has been going on since Greenspan&amp;#8217;s day, it&amp;#8217;s got worse and worse.
Of course, the banks are being stuffed with deposits, because of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt;, but this shows how little of the money created ever gets put to productive use. If nobody is spending, it seems likely that price pressure will remain&amp;nbsp;muted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=H0Cz" alt="loan to deposit ratio"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always struggle to get these sorts of charts from the BoE website, but I&amp;#8217;d be surprised if it&amp;#8217;s very different. 
Countries have to keep their monetary policies in line, if they have a hope of avoiding letting their currencies rise against the dollar. 
Maybe Evergrande is an example of what this leads&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Techie&amp;nbsp;note&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve taken to using Windows Powershell recently.
It&amp;#8217;s a learning curve for me, but it seems to work &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;.
What&amp;#8217;s really annoying, though, is that it doesn&amp;#8217;t use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UTF8&lt;/span&gt; encoding by default.
This, specifically, means that if I capture stdout to a file, it&amp;#8217;s not &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UTF8&lt;/span&gt; and it will spook a program that expects such an encoding as&amp;nbsp;input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be fixed in something like Notepad++ or by using out-file with an -Encoding parameter, but it&amp;#8217;s niggling. Anyway, the fix is to install Powershell 6 or 7 on windows. This is very easy, and fixes the problems at a stroke, because its default text encoding is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UTF8&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are an American, you probably don&amp;#8217;t care, but if you are a European and you want to use symbols like £ and € you&amp;nbsp;might.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hit this problem specifically when using &lt;a href="https://hledger.org/"&gt;hledger&lt;/a&gt; but I now realize that it had tripped me up before when using command line programs.  Hledger is a fab system, if you like doing things in text on the command&amp;nbsp;line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href="https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/2019/03/how-to-install-and-update-powershell-6/"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; to find out how to upgrade my powershell, but there are many with similar instructions. If you are feeling brave, you can just paste this into &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PS5&lt;/span&gt; and click &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; a couple of&amp;nbsp;times:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;iex &amp;quot;&amp;amp; { $(irm https://aka.ms/install-powershell.ps1) } -UseMSI&amp;quot;  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems perverse that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MS&lt;/span&gt; are so slow in making this the default that ships with Windows&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty much a standard risk-on day.
10Y yield now hitting 1.4%, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; weak (back to 93), stocks generally up.
Commodities strong, oil up 1.3%, Brent &amp;gt; $77/barrel.
Markets don&amp;#8217;t really believe that the Fed will ever taper.

&lt;h2&gt;Macro matters, or does&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, Dominick Harrod would have a slot on the six o&amp;#8217;clock &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt; news explaining the latest twists of the economy. He dutifully reported the latest trade figures, always pointing out how important &amp;#8220;invisibles&amp;#8221; were to offsetting some of the red ink on our balance in goods.
He probably talked about the difference between the current account and the capital account, I can&amp;#8217;t really remember. He probably occasionally talked about unemployment, but that didn&amp;#8217;t seem such a big problem as inflation, and how much it had changed since last month (a second derivative, as I&amp;#8217;d eventually come to understand it&amp;nbsp;was).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I don&amp;#8217;t think the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt; even has a specialist economics correspondent, certainly not one who is a fixture on the daily news broadcast (not that I ever watch that, so I might be totally wrong). Economics correspondents have gone the way of industrial correspondents, who used to tell us daily which industry was on strike this week, and what good or service would therefore be in short supply. The world has changed, but the social science that might be able to explain why it has changed in the way it has has gone out of fashion. I imagine more students want to study forensic science, or business studies, than economics now. The calculus probably puts them&amp;nbsp;off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I cannot help being a child of my time, but I remain interested in economics. I don&amp;#8217;t suppose that this will come as any sort of surprise to any of you regular regular readers. All four of you. We all like to know why things happen, and what&amp;#8217;s bigger than the Chinese economy? So I was interested to read &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/91595b8b-b15d-4bca-9f9e-14a5556ee2ab"&gt;this piece&lt;/a&gt; by Andy Xie about what&amp;#8217;s going on in the Middle Kingdom. He explains that in China, politics comes first, and that business will always be subservient to the Party. But what he casually mentions is that the (not so) secret sauce of China is an undervalued exchange&amp;nbsp;rate.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that what economics says about exchange rates (e.g. that the carry trade should not work because of covered interest rate parity) nobody believes any longer. Rational expectations, Ricardian equivalence, Real Business Cycle theory. All of them are taught, but none of them work.  Just look at central banks predictions of the path of future interest rates, to see how spectacularly this doesn&amp;#8217;t work. Economics tells us that arbitrage opportunities do not persist for long, and then look at what the discount curve constructed from long-dated swaps and bonds was predicting for future short-term rates back in 2009. It&amp;#8217;s hopeless, but nobody comes forward with a theory that works, or even, seemingly is tested against&amp;nbsp;reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know if this observation is remotely actionable. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; has been running a massive deficit for years, but as we know, deficits don&amp;#8217;t matter. The official line is that the world has a desperate shortage of safe assets. To me, the dollar, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasuries don&amp;#8217;t seem very safe, especially if we ever get inflation. But if Xi Jin Ping is relentlessly selling &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; to keep his country competitive and keep the dollar elevated, maybe we will never get inflation and so maybe Treasuries are the ultimate safe asset. There is no better trade than to tuck in behind a central bank that is buying something regardless of its price. As usual, everything comes down to how long the central banks can keep the show on the&amp;nbsp;road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mere prospect of a statement by the Fed was enough to trigger a risk-on reaction in the markets today.
Commodities were pretty strong (oil up 2.2%, copper up 3.2%), bonds sagged a bit, but &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UST&lt;/span&gt; 10Y yield is still above 1.3% (just). 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; dropped a bit, but still hovers over 93.
I am writing this before anything is known about the Fed&amp;#8217;s announcement, but as long as they don&amp;#8217;t say they&amp;#8217;re stopping &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; dead in its tracks, I would expect the market to keep going in the same direction.
With J Powell wanting to ensure he gets re-appointed in Feb, it&amp;#8217;s hard to see them doing very much at all: the markets love &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt;, politicians love it (because it makes it much easier to run deficits), billionaires love it, because it makes it cheaper to borrow against their stock portfolios, and CEOs love it because it makes funding buybacks&amp;nbsp;cheaper. &lt;/p&gt;

He focusses on the non-linear response of the value of the security to interest rates.
These things are pretty high risk, but if you think that short term interest rates are going to be pinned to zero, they might be worth a look.
&lt;a href="https://www.simplysafedividends.com/intelligent-income/posts/19-a-guide-to-investing-in-mortgage-reits"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; argues that income-focussed investors should steer well clear. 
Arguably, if you think $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NLY&lt;/span&gt; is an interesting security because you have a firm view about steepening or flattening, you&amp;#8217;d be better off getting direct exposure via  the futures markets in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; treasuries or&amp;nbsp;Eurodollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As seems inevitable, the market bought the dip, and we had a roaring risk-on day again today, although equity prices faded towards the end of the trading day.
Forex was quiet (except something happened in Brazil, I&amp;#8217;m guessing). &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; was dead flat.
Bonds were quiet, as were most commodities. Maybe this is the calm before the&amp;nbsp;storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Labour&amp;nbsp;markets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of stories in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; about staff shortages. 
Things are not delivered, including food and post.
Things are not collected, including rubbish.
To me, this is a wonderful thing to behold. 
For a long time, we&amp;#8217;ve had dismal wage increases, but now at long last the year on year rate is pushing 9%. 
Not only will this cheer up workers enormously, it will – I hope – trigger some modest inflation, which will mean that monetary conditions can get slightly&amp;nbsp;looser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, unless the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; government crank up taxes, especially taxes on labour, which will drain spending power out of the economy. I guess this is all about fetishizing &amp;#8216;sound money&amp;#8217; and failing to ask what exactly is being achieved by diverting private incomes to reward government&amp;nbsp;creditors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labour costs and commodity prices have been very quiescent for decades. We should just do the experiment and see what happens. We have discovered that monetary polices have been fairly powerless to ignite sustained inflation, but we have never tried to do it with fiscal policy. Volker showed that monetary policy could be very powerful in combating inflation, and Geoffrey Howe showed that fiscal policy could be&amp;nbsp;too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a catastrophic time in the 1920&amp;#8217;s because Norman Montague persuaded Churchill that the pound should go back on the gold standard at the pre-war parity. Do we need to see the modern equivalent of the Jarrow marches and the National Strike to discover again that a soggy exchange rate is a wonderful tonic for the real economy, even if it is not very popular in the City. Oh, these days they probably don&amp;#8217;t care. Hedging is cheap and&amp;nbsp;easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, there is rarely just a single company that has found a way to inflate assets and lighten liabilities. The big question on everyone&amp;#8217;s lips is whether is it the new Lehman or just a freak outlier.

&lt;h2&gt;Evergrande&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, there is rarely just a single company that has found a way to inflate assets and lighten liabilities. The big question on everyone&amp;#8217;s lips is whether is it the new Lehman or just a freak outlier. (Or, if it is the new Lehman Brothers, but this time the People&amp;#8217;s Bank of China has learned from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; history and is going to bail it out and maket all its creditors whole&amp;nbsp;regardless.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea, but I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure there are plenty of skeletons in the Evergrande cupboard. I somehow doubt if anyone does a Red Roulette and lifts the curtain on the event. Maybe I&amp;#8217;m wrong, but with so much money at stake, it&amp;#8217;d be amazing if corruption was entirely absent, not least of public officials whose job it is to dole out permits for&amp;nbsp;redevelopment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, if Evergrande drags down the Chines economy, it&amp;#8217;s going to drag down Australian stocks in general and miners in particular. It&amp;#8217;s going to drag down commodities too, notwithstanding shortages of nat gas in Europe. It will be &amp;#8216;interesting&amp;#8217; to see how this plays&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2021/eb_21-12"&gt;This brief&lt;/a&gt; produced for the Richmond Fed is a pretty clear and even-handed account of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt;.
As you will be aware, I think that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; is coming soon to a government near you, wherever you live (apart from the Eurozone, of course). 
As it neatly summarizes the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; policy prescription: the central bank and the finance ministry swap places. The central bank prints money to finance government spending, while the finance ministry stands at the ready to drain liquidity as soon as inflation looks as though it may be about to get started. Jay Powell hands the punch-bowl over to Janet&amp;nbsp;Yellen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brief is a bit caution, saying that it&amp;#8217;s only since the 1980s that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; has provided a good description of the world as we have observed it, and that historically there are plenty of examples of monetary financing of government spending going horribly wrong.
Well, the 1980s were a long time ago, and it sounds to me as though it&amp;#8217;s worth a go.
And it seems like Eliz. Warren, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AOC&lt;/span&gt;, Bernie and some people in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; Labour Party&amp;nbsp;agree. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To tolerate high levels of inequality, deteriorating public services, decaying 1970&amp;#8217;s infrastructure just because things went horribly wrong in Germany in the 1920s seems&amp;nbsp;perverse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this time really is different. For a start, the world is on floating exchange rates. Three decades of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; ∞ in Japan have proved that the inflation dragon is not just snoozing, it&amp;#8217;s as dead as 8-track tape machines. Let&amp;#8217;s give &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; a&amp;nbsp;chance!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-track_tape"&gt;8 track tape&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should mention that I was alerted to the Richmond Fed brief by listening to an interesting conversation between Kevin Muir and Dario Perkins in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEUVPWoshk0"&gt;this week&amp;#8217;s Market Huddle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Imagine Whirled&amp;nbsp;Peas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Joby Aviation, which plans to begin an electric air taxi service in 2024, is worth more than Lufthansa, EasyJet or JetBlue. Does that seem right? In this market, why not? Heck, earlier this year, Tesla was worth more than the next nine car manufacturers combined, though now only the next six. Beyond Meat, made with pea protein, is worth more than the entire market for peas eaten globally—like the bumper sticker says: Imagine whirled peas. Do fundamentals even matter? I can go on. Used-car sales platform Carvana is worth more than Volvo, Honda, Ford or Hyundai. Airbnb is worth more than Marriott and Hilton combined. Crypto-exchange Coinbase is worth more than the Nasdaq. I live at the intersection of innovation and disruption, but when companies are worth more than any possible reality, watch out.&amp;#8221; -Andy Kessler, &lt;a href="https://thefelderreport.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=810d395d0604058b17042e118&amp;amp;id=2352a081cb&amp;amp;e=8d66df2c11"&gt;The Stock Market Fails A&amp;nbsp;Breathalyzer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an amazing quote, and article. It articulates, brilliantly, how level ten crazy the current market is, how fundamentals are so hated that they are not so much unimportant as they are actively harmful to the price of the stock. A company that redeems debt rather than equity, that makes profits, both net and operational, that pays dividends and has been trading for decades, well, that&amp;#8217;s a &amp;#8220;value trap&amp;#8221; stock that is only going lower in today&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.andykessler.com/andy_kessler/2021/09/marketfailsabreathalyzer.html"&gt;The original article, from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WSJ&lt;/span&gt; (paywalled)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Crescat August Letter is&amp;nbsp;out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.crescat.net/august-research-letter/"&gt;Here is it.&lt;/a&gt;
Unsurprisingly, it&amp;#8217;s bullish commodities, especially precious metals.
Maybe it is time for the yellow metal (gold) to have its day in the sun, along side the yellow ore&amp;nbsp;(uranium). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter points out that filtering out the noise surrounding the posturing of the odd Democrat member, the Biden administration is hell-bent on fixing the atmosphere, inequality, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; dependence on Chinese manufacturing capacity and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s crumbling infrastructure. It&amp;#8217;s hard to believe that he will not get a majority of elected members to support all of these separately, even if fixing all four in one go might be a (wobbly) bridge too&amp;nbsp;far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kuppy&amp;nbsp;Speaks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2021/09/20/when-the-levee-breaks/"&gt;Kuppy is the Rod Liddle of financial markets.&lt;/a&gt;
He is in a perpetual state of outrage. 
But that doesn&amp;#8217;t mean that he is not right (any more than Rod&amp;#8217;s intemperate rants mean that he is wrong).
Today&amp;#8217;s post argues that &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; the Fed liquidity is going to reach as far as commodities and labour.
This is now a heterodox view. The dollar is strong, bond yields are low, inflation is &lt;em&gt;transitory&lt;/em&gt;. Any day now, markets will start to function normally, the high prices in commodity markets will prove, once again, the best antidote to high prices in commodity markets, and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; will resume it&amp;#8217;s march upwards.
That&amp;#8217;s the mainstream view. 
The idea that this time it might be different is unthinkable. But &lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt; unthinkable things happen. I&amp;#8217;m keeping an open&amp;nbsp;mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Written at about 15:00 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UTC&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything is down,&amp;nbsp;except:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;then&amp;nbsp;Yen,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gold and&amp;nbsp;silver,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Treasuries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They dollar is pretty flat, on a trade-weighted index. 
Bonds are pretty flat.
Equities, globally, have been hit, as have&amp;nbsp;commodities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The driver is Evergrande, presumably.
Things are complicated by China markets being shut today and tomorrow&amp;nbsp;(Tuesday).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is a risk off day, and possibly one of&amp;nbsp;many. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPM&lt;/span&gt; is bullish on&amp;nbsp;equities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am, by nature, bearish. I&amp;#8217;ve outlined the bear case, or at least referenced articles which make it, many times. There are counter arguments, though, which are largely based on the argument that we are in an early stage of the post-Covid global economic recovery.
Detailed points, made by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPM&lt;/span&gt; and relayed by &lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/"&gt;The Market Ear&lt;/a&gt; are as&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent slowdown is temporary and primarily driven by the Delta variant. &amp;#8220;We see these risks as well-flagged and in some cases&amp;nbsp;overdone&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cross-border activity has the potential to more meaningfully rebound for the first time since the onset of the&amp;nbsp;pandemic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central bank policies should remain&amp;nbsp;growth-oriented&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China’s slowdown &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YTD&lt;/span&gt; is likely to be countered soon with a policy&amp;nbsp;pivot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;low probability of significant corporate tax policy&amp;nbsp;change&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;periods of significant market weakness are likely to get dampened by accelerated buyback programs (current daily buyback run-rate is at ~$3.5 billion and rising) and positive retail flows given “excess”&amp;nbsp;savings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the inventory (~25 year lows) and capex cycles (post-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GFC&lt;/span&gt; low), while not tracking their usual cyclical behavior, are still in early innings with ample room to drive&amp;nbsp;growth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Consumer is super strong. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPM&lt;/span&gt; thinks the market underestimates the robustness of consumer balance sheets and more pointedly the savings war chest in place to support future spending. &amp;#8220;The cumulative “excess” savings for consumers since onset of Covid (2/2020) is at $2.4T excluding the likely boost from rising asset&amp;nbsp;values&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consensus is currently assuming a very conservative earnings compression of -1.3% for 2H21 compared to 1H21 (seasonally demand has been much stronger during 2H compared to 1H in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;). &amp;#8220;In our view, the street estimates do not fully account for this seasonality and the cumulative effect of ongoing global re-opening with rising mobility as Covid eases, expanding labor market with wage gains, higher operating margin and falling interest expense, and reduction in share count from&amp;nbsp;buybacks&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPM&lt;/span&gt; are raising their &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EPS&lt;/span&gt; estimates from $205 to $210 for 2021 (consensus at $201.03) and from $230 to $240 for 2022 (consensus at $220.35), as well as slightly increasing 2021 year-end S&amp;amp;P 500 price target to 4,700 and sees &amp;gt;5000 in&amp;nbsp;2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that it&amp;#8217;s likely that interest rates will continue to fall, and debt-financed buybacks will accelerate, as above, and that this will be a big driver. It&amp;#8217;s hard for a stock price to go down when the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; can borrow funds to manipulate the market in his company&amp;#8217;s stock at a negative real&amp;nbsp;cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPM&lt;/span&gt; certainly doesn&amp;#8217;t benefit from a bear market with crashing liquidity and transaction volumes (and therefore fees), so they are talking their book. Just because they are, it doesn&amp;#8217;t mean that they are&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tesla still a&amp;nbsp;Ponzi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tme.net/blog/tesla-scandal/"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; recaps all the things that make you go &amp;#8220;hmmm&amp;#8221; about Tesla. They are all well known, to me at least, and none of them have dented the stock price. 
But now the broader market seems to be finally on the point of going down, maybe the day of reckoning for Tesla is&amp;nbsp;nigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No clear driver but today was very risk off. The usual bump in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; at the end of the week failed to materialize. It was the &amp;#8220;quad witching hour&amp;#8221; so maybe there was some sort of gamma squeeze at work. 
Nearly every index was down, apart from Japan (and that might be a timezone thing). Most stocks too (but not Tesla: maybe a short-squeeze thing). 
Yields were up a few basis points. We haven&amp;#8217;t seen panic yet, neither have we seen a flight to safety.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; is up, 93.2, with the inevitable damage to commodities across the&amp;nbsp;board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, it was a good day to be in cash.
The markets have been conditioned to expect a bounce after a Friday like this.
My best guess is that we&amp;#8217;ll see one again, but these are strange time.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; runs a constant current account deficit, which means that the countries that export to it are awash in dollars.
Those dollars are going to end up somewhere, and the destination of choice for decades has been &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; mega-cap equities. At some point that will&amp;nbsp;change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.worksinprogress.co/issue/the-housing-theory-of-everything/"&gt;This argues&lt;/a&gt; that all the woes of the world come from our failure to sort out housing policy.

&lt;p&gt;I think there are more things wrong with our society than a recent failure to build houses where they are needed, but certainly this is a serious failing which has damaged our productivity, and thence our welfare, a great deal, over the last few&amp;nbsp;generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;If you ever wondered whether lobbying&amp;nbsp;works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://stephensemler.substack.com/p/do-barbara-lee-and-mark-pocan-have?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTAyMDI1LCJwb3N0X2lkIjo0MTM3ODY5NywiXyI6IjJTQkZvIiwiaWF0IjoxNjMxNzgzNDI4LCJleHAiOjE2MzE3ODcwMjgsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0zNzI5OCIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.3RsqKIiDLOSY8BSa-1VFT_dAcNcY3LYSbztwgOB4L08"&gt;Well, it looks like it&amp;nbsp;does.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pan African&amp;nbsp;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4378830-pan-african-resources-looks-overvalued"&gt;This analysis suggests that it was over-valued, at $1,500 per oz. of gold.&lt;/a&gt;
Gold is now over $1,800/oz and so the economics of this company should look a lot better.
It is a sort of option on gold, but it does pay a hefty dividend, so it&amp;#8217;s a pretty cheap option.
I have no position, and I don&amp;#8217;t intend to open one, but it looked interesting. 
&lt;a href="https://www.miningmx.com/news/gold/47480-pan-african-to-pay-record-dividend-and-buy-back-programme/"&gt;It has just announced a buyback programme&lt;/a&gt; which should keep the share price&amp;nbsp;buoyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Another $1 trillion Fed facility that is meant to be temporary but won&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;be&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street on Parade writes up the overnight reverse repo facility, a tool from the Fed toolbox which now is in very active use on a daily basis. &lt;a href="https://wallstreetonparade.com/2021/09/quietly-the-fed-has-seduced-1-trillion-a-day-into-the-best-game-in-town-its-reverse-repo-facility/"&gt;Read more&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money market funds, which exist because banks pay too little interest on money, were holding too much poor credit paper, so the Fed bought it all up and offered an attractive interest rate on the cash which the funds ended up holding. Five basis points probably doesn&amp;#8217;t sound very much to you or me, but on a trillion dollars worth of reserve balances, it&amp;#8217;s quite a sum. Half a billion, in&amp;nbsp;fact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people write about these Fed facilities, most famously Zoltan Pozsar, but I find the articles written by Pam Martens and her husband very&amp;nbsp;readable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unexpected bounce in retail sales in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; in August caused a moment of very mild panic.
Slight weakness in equities, very slight droop in bonds (10Y &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; now at 1.332% gross redemption yield), dollar strong (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; at 92.9), commodities generally weaker.
Monetary metals still weak.
Gold back down to $1755/oz. I don&amp;#8217;t know, but I feel that crypto investors have taken some air out of the gold price. Bitcoin is now at $47.7K: up 336% on the&amp;nbsp;year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Crony capitalism and corporate&amp;nbsp;welfare&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Left thinks capitalism is evil because it gives too much power to corporates. The Right thinks socialism is evil because it gives too much power to organized labour. The libertarians hate capitalism because the believe that the returns to corporate lobbying ensure that groups end with corruption in both groups (in the sense that policies end up being introduced that benefit the representatives at the expense of the general&amp;nbsp;public).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The odd thing is that both sides agree on the disease, but each thinks that only its own medicine will cure the patient. It is like the refrain that one hears from the Right that whenever socialism fails, which it frequently does, defenders will always argue that it wasn&amp;#8217;t real&amp;nbsp;socialism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of authors have identified the problem: A Capitalism for the People: Recapturing the Lost Genius of American Prosperity by Luigi Zingales, One of any number of books by David Stockman, Overripe Economy: American Capitalism and the Crisis of Democracy by Alan Nasser and The Myth of Capitalism by Mark&amp;nbsp;Tepper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The genius of democracy is that we get a chance to throw out our rulers once or twice a decade, not because we think the new lot will be better, but because we know that, over time, the last lot will have become corrupted by power. Unfortunately, this mechanism is lacking in modern capitalism, with it&amp;#8217;s glacial rate of creative destruction (gifted to us by the Central&amp;nbsp;Bankers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solving this dilemma is difficult but I think that a more aggressive regulation of monopolies would be a good start and a reduction in any regulations that can create barriers to entry. 
Although businesses pretend they hate regulation, they actually know that a well-crafted piece of regulation can keep disruptive innovations out of the market for ever, practically.
If you have ever wondered why corporate tax rates, have come down so far, and generally taxes on capital have been going down while taxes on labour have been going up, you need to look no further than the power of corporate lobbying.
If you wonder why regulation just keeps piling up while politicians keep making speeches about how damaging it is and how they are going to get rid of it, just ask yourself &lt;em&gt;cui&amp;nbsp;bono?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Substack or sub par?</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/substack-or-sub-par.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-09-15T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:59+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-09-15:/substack-or-sub-par.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;15 Sept&amp;nbsp;2021&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Substack&amp;nbsp;update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to bite the bullet and parlay my blog, generated by &lt;a href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Pelican&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  into an actual newsletter.
I had a try using Convert Kit, but I got bored with cutting and pasting.
It wasn&amp;#8217;t too bad for the actual post, but I have a habit of noticing typos after I&amp;#8217;ve uploaded to the server, so fixing these things when I was using ConvertKit meant a double edit.
The same problem will exist unless I can find a way of auto-posting to substack from Pelican (without learning the Pelican &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; and grovelling around in&amp;nbsp;Python).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I imported the archive into Substack, via an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; feed, but I seem to have lost all but the summary parts of the&amp;nbsp;post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Childcare&amp;nbsp;costs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chart from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OECD&lt;/span&gt; shows that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; has fairly high childcare costs. 
I know these things are hard to compare across countries, even if they are scaled off average wages, because an average loses so much information about the distribution of costs.
The vast bulk of childcare is &amp;#8216;free&amp;#8217; in the sense that it the reward for doing it is not monetary. Still, it is depressing, especially for parents of small children who live in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Brave&amp;nbsp;choice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been using Firefox as a browser for a long time now, but somehow the latest update is incompatible with a favourite extension: the KeepassXC browser extension.
I had noticed that Firefox can be very heavy on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPU&lt;/span&gt; usage in the past. To be fair, this is more a fault of the site owners larding their pages with Javascript, but I can&amp;#8217;t do anything about that, whereas a browser potentially can (even at the cost of some functionality).
I am agnostic in my preferences of browsers, so I decided to give Brave another go. 
One the whole, it seems to run&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It&amp;#8217;s in the&amp;nbsp;price!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first came across technical analysis in the 1980s. Yep, that long ago. The introduction was along the lines of &amp;#8220;Chartists, who are to finance what astrologers are to economics, stare at price histories, transformed in various ways, possibly, to come up with implausible predictions about the future.&amp;#8221;
Reading books like &amp;#8220;A Random Walk Down Wall Street&amp;#8221; convinced me that there was no auto-correlation in prices, that all securities executed a random walk (or, as I later came to understand it, a series of values drawn from a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(probability_theory)"&gt;martingale&lt;/a&gt;). This essentially rules out technical analysis as having any predictive value and so renders null any value in studying price&amp;nbsp;histories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my old age, I have revised my view somewhat. I have done so on a number of matters in which I had a high level of conviction in the past.
I am still not convinced about the Voodoo, but I do acknowledge that a convincing thesis has to be backed up by some indication that &amp;#8220;the market&amp;#8221; has at least started to be aware of it. 
Consider the price chart below. At point 6, on a fundamentals basis, Enron should have been a sell. But the stock didn&amp;#8217;t really start to sink convincingly for another year, and actually went up for half of that year. 
Looking at a price history can warn you that the time is not yet ripe to transact. As they say, to be early is just another way of being wrong.
And I acknowledge that it&amp;#8217;s very unlikely that prices are actually random&amp;nbsp;walks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="8a2256b12199c46d0d89bbc2ded60ada.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/8a2256b12199c46d0d89bbc2ded60ada.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economist in me wants to say that even if prices don&amp;#8217;t have any autocorrelation, it&amp;#8217;s still impossible to reason from them because a clearing price is determined by the intersection of two schedules, supply and demand, both of which might be moving around to cause the price change. 
In a secondary market, every buyer has a seller. In the secondary market in equities, very often the marginal buyer, and seller, is the company itself, with at the money offers and buybacks becoming increasingly&amp;nbsp;important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Continuing anger about Kaplan and&amp;nbsp;Rosengren&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I simply don&amp;#8217;t understand why &lt;a href="https://wallstreetonparade.com/2021/09/the-latest-outrage-over-fed-presidents-trading-stocks-is-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg/"&gt;this story&lt;/a&gt; is not bigger news. There is a minor meme on Twitter where people joke that the market is now starting to sag, because Kaplan is in liquidation mode, following his being outed. For example, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NorthmanTrader/status/1436253392503025670?s=20"&gt;this tweet from Sven&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tesla and&amp;nbsp;@Jack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TESLAcharts/status/1437470671500611596?s=20"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TC&lt;/span&gt;, aka Tesla Charts has discovered that Twitter is blocking visibility of his tweets.&lt;/a&gt;
I don&amp;#8217;t understand the details of this, but it appears to be fairly convincing evidence that Twitter is colluding with Elon Musk to suppress negative, but legitimate, commentary on Tesla Inc. 
Elon is by far the best stock price manipulator on the planet right now, and having some sort of ability to suppress negative comment on social media would surely be part of this guy&amp;#8217;s toolkit. 
Although I&amp;#8217;d like to think this will all come out in the court case after the truth comes out, I think there is a better than even chance that it never comes&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uranium, natty gas, oil, all rising strongly. Monetary metals are still weak.
Most equity markets fairly subdued, except for China (and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HK&lt;/span&gt;, which is of course still China), which is being dragged down by Evergrande, which is widely expected to default on its debt any day now. Will this be the catalyst? China is looking increasingly unattractive, with all but one of the major indices (Shanghai, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSI&lt;/span&gt; 300, Shanghai 50 and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CH50&lt;/span&gt;) down in 2021. The one is the Shanghai index, which is (presumably) the wider&amp;nbsp;market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds are flattish, presumably balanced between strong opposing forces in the form of weak equity markets and roaring inflation, which may or may not be&amp;nbsp;transitory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some micro-cap exploration companies, such as $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SD&lt;/span&gt; (Sandridge) and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTE&lt;/span&gt; (Baytex Energy) are catching a strong bid, no doubt driven by the spike in natural gas prices. 
It may be too early to call this a turnaround, but energy is almost the last sector to not benefit from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt;∞. The danger is that a weakness in the broader market will derail the rally before it gets&amp;nbsp;going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian equities, particularly energy-linked like $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GAZP&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROSN&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LKOH&lt;/span&gt; (all traded on the Moscow exchange) benefited too. Rusal ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RUAL&lt;/span&gt;) is not an energy company but sells a product that embeds a lot of energy in its production and, and presumably can get energy at cheap prices, compared to smelters in the west, also went&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This market feels as though it might be about to start moving. In which direction is anyone&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, earnings per share have kept going up by around 6% annually, relentlessly, since&amp;nbsp;1935. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Will the BoE ever need to call upon the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; Treasury&amp;#8217;s indemnity to protect it from losses on its &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;portfolio?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://moneyinsideout.exantedata.com/p/bank-of-england-balance-sheet-shrinkage"&gt;Chris Marsh thinks that the BoE could possibly come unstuck waiting for its gilts holdings to self-liquidate.&lt;/a&gt; He explains that as soon as bank rate exceeds 100bp, the BoE will face capital losses on its portfolio. 
I am in awe of people like Chris who write such detailed stuff for free. Stuff that covers the topic so much more authoritatively than the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; or similar.
I don&amp;#8217;t even know who Exante are. Presumably, a bunch of nerdy economists with a talent for&amp;nbsp;in-jokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; inflation slows … to&amp;nbsp;5.3%&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fans of Lacy Hunt are slugging it out with the fans of Bill Fleckenstein. 
Basically, for every statistic that supports the thesis that inflation is breaking out, there is an equally convincing one that we&amp;#8217;re headed, in the longer term, to turn into Japan.
&amp;#8220;We&amp;#8221; meaning the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;, but once inflation takes off there, it&amp;#8217;s likely to spread to the rest of the world. 
Not that S. Africa or Turkey are exactly in a deflationary spiral right&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the arguments that inflation truly is temporary (or &amp;#8216;transitory&amp;#8217; as J Powell refers to it) is that if inflation was actually going to become embedded, we&amp;#8217;d see evidence for this in the markets.
Certainly, the Eurodollar futures markets show almost no sign of an expectation of short term rates going up.
One might argue that this just an expectation that the Fed isn&amp;#8217;t going to raise short term rates, probably ever.
The problem is that even 30 year treasuries are steady, whereas if markets really believed there was a real risk of persistent inflation, they&amp;#8217;d be&amp;nbsp;collapsing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes another risk-off day.
This must be the longest run of bad news (for bulls) for a year.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPI&lt;/span&gt; numbers were more or less in line with expectations.
The Democrats have proposed a bill to reverse some of Trump&amp;#8217;s cuts in corporation tax, which may explain some of the movement,
though global equities were weak and they will benefit, relatively, one would have thought. 
Consumable commodities (i.e. everything but precious metals) were generally down. Gold and miners were up.
Uranium, which has had a stonking run of late, faded, with the Sprott Trust, $U.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UN&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSE&lt;/span&gt; losing 14%. 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; was flat, but &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPY&lt;/span&gt; was down&amp;nbsp;32bp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a proposal for some sort of surcharge on those making $5M or more pa: the sort of tax bracket where it would be possible to route earnings through some sort of tax-advantaged entity to avoid this sort of tax. I don&amp;#8217;t even know why I wrote that: I don&amp;#8217;t even understand the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; tax system, so how can I guess what would work in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;? Except to say that in a tax code of the monumental complexity of that country&amp;#8217;s there has to be a&amp;nbsp;few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, equity valuations are stretched beyond breaking points, by almost any metric, so maybe it&amp;#8217;s just that the market has woken up to this.
Or, maybe it&amp;#8217;s because central banks are now nearly all easing off on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt;. I find it hard to believe that the Fed will not at least commit to tapering within a month or&amp;nbsp;two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Interesting&amp;nbsp;podcasts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed &lt;em&gt;The Market Huddle&lt;/em&gt; this week. 
Lyn Alden was on. Her monthly newsletter is worth a read. &lt;a href="https://www.lynalden.com/august-2021-newsletter/"&gt;The August edition&lt;/a&gt; is now out.
It&amp;#8217;s free, and she is not talking her own book (much).
I found her discussion of what she calls the petrodollar system interesting.
It was reminiscent of stuff by &lt;a href="https://alhambrapartners.com/author/jsnider/"&gt;Jeff Snider&lt;/a&gt;.
It argued that the deal that was done between the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; and Saudi Arabia enabled the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; to run up its current account deficit to mind boggling levels, confident that the reserve currency status of the dollar would be&amp;nbsp;undamaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not alone in believing that the next crisis will start in the currency market, probably a loss of confidence in the dollar.
At some point, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; will have to row back from its position that the dollar is its currency, but our problem. Where &amp;#8216;our&amp;#8217; refers to the rest of the world.
I have never totally bought the idea that the world is suffering from a severe shortage of &amp;#8220;safe assets&amp;#8221; by which the promoters of this idea mean &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasuries.
USTs are only a safe asset as long as the unit they are denominated in is stable with respect to other currencies.
Eventually, European countries will start paying a positive real rate of interest on their debt, which could be awkward for&amp;nbsp;Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyn is bullish on commodities, especially&amp;nbsp;oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="ec0cc620e1ad5c97a5d55697a813f688.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/ec0cc620e1ad5c97a5d55697a813f688.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is Coinbase a&amp;nbsp;bank?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve used exchanges like Coinbase to buy crypto currencies.
It never occurred to me to leave the currency with the exchange. 
My understanding was that you are supposed to get your own wallet, ideally disconnected from the Internet where you can store your coins.
(Really, this is a matter of storing your private keys.)
Most people, I&amp;#8217;m guessing, don&amp;#8217;t use coinbase like this: they leave their purchased &amp;#8220;crypto&amp;#8221; with Coinbase.
Which it can use for other purposes. Just like a bank can lend transfer funds deposited by customer A to customer B.
This is the essence of banking, but it obviously creates a situation in which customer A may not get his money back.
The problem is fixed by the government indemnifying customer A against loss. 
Which is great for banks as it allows them to borrow at no cost. (Remember, deposits are loans to the bank.)
But there is a cost: extensive regulation and restrictions on what sort of lending to customer B can take&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coinbase works like this, as far as I can tell, except the government does not get involved. So customer A is exposed.
But customer A is either oblivious to the risk (probably) or has done a careful analysis of the creditworthiness of Coinbase and has concluded that there is an acceptable risk of default (highly&amp;nbsp;unlikely).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Francine McKenna has written a long piece about this in &lt;a href="https://thedig.substack.com/p/to-be-regulated-or-not-to-be-regulated"&gt;The Dig&lt;/a&gt;.
My take on all this is that Coinbase and co are going to end up being regulated out of existence (or forced into the arms of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPM&lt;/span&gt; or similar).
We will&amp;nbsp;see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rates are going lower,&amp;nbsp;surely!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The price of money" src="https://blog.evergree​​ngavekal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Price-of-Money.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Fed will never let markets drop&amp;nbsp;again!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hussmanfunds.com/comment/mc210912/"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is a great commentary by John P. Hussman.
It points out the irrationality of investors now. 
Not the irrationality of thinking that liquidity produced by the Fed will always be at the ready to extinguish wildfires of assets going down in price.
No, the irrationality of thinking that the Fed itself has the power to support markets, when we know it has failed so many times in the past.
Read the article for examples, but one that caught my attention was the failure of &lt;em&gt;The Maestro&lt;/em&gt; to reverse the 2000 dot com&amp;nbsp;bust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mid October will see the Treasury hit its debt ceiling. &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5fb0614d-ea49-48c6-a6fb-0f7a23dfa2ae"&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt;.
I&amp;#8217;ve seen a few commentators suggesting that this could be the catalyst to finally end the extraordinary bull run of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt;.
I&amp;#8217;ll believe it when I see it, but I did buy a couple of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OTM&lt;/span&gt; puts, just in&amp;nbsp;case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NY&lt;/span&gt; Fed survey of consumer expectations showed that expectations of fairly steep inflation were becoming embedded.
&lt;a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/sce#/commodexp-1"&gt;The chart on this page&lt;/a&gt; shows that consumers expect more or less everything to have a rate of price increase between seven and ten percent.
The exception, oddly, is gold, which is expected to respond only to the tune of 5%.
Bonds barely budged. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt; was pretty quiet too. Commodities were not strongly affected, although natural gas went up by 5% (in a day!). The hydrocarbon complex was dragged higher. I suspect that gasoline will be the next to pick up the trend.
I guess the marginal buyer is still the Fed. 
But at some point, it will not&amp;nbsp;be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks were not strongly affected, either way. Mild inflation is pretty good for stocks, as long as labour costs are kept under&amp;nbsp;control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Matt Stoller on&amp;nbsp;monopoly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has noticed that the stockmarket in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; has had an incredible run over the last year or two.
The finger of blame (or praise, possibly) is pointed at the Fed.
I am not convinced that the Fed is solely responsible.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;10th&amp;nbsp;Sept&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Matt Stoller on&amp;nbsp;monopoly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has noticed that the stockmarket in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; has had an incredible run over the last year or two.
The finger of blame (or praise, possibly) is pointed at the Fed.
I am not convinced that the Fed is solely responsible.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt; has been fairly aggressive in pursuing easy money policies, to the extent that 10 year bunds are trading at negative redemption yields.
Christine Lagarde is purchasing €80B govt. bonds a month, with a balance sheet which is €1.85T. 
This is not quite keeping pace with Jerome, but it&amp;#8217;s not doing badly, given the dominance of Germany in Europe and their obsession with&amp;nbsp;inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what explains the relative outperformance of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;? 
To a certain extent, it is the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAA&lt;/span&gt;(N)G. 
Big Tech has a stranglehold on several global markets. 
Apple may not sell as many phones as Samsung, but it has margins which are an order of magnitude higher.
Nothing outside China compares with Amazon or Facebook, or Google.
This is undoubtedly a&amp;nbsp;factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, another factor is the total neutering of the competition authorities in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;. 
Big Tech totally dominates the sectors they specialize in.
Apple outsells all other mobile phone manufacturers combined, at least in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;.
Where there are large barriers to entry, there are economic rents to be had, and the gross margins charged by Big Tech certainly proves that they are able to exercise monopoly power. Well, to my mind at least. The insane prices of medical treatments, and of Ivy League university fees, suggest that Big Tech is not&amp;nbsp;unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is regrettable, but this is not a politics blog. I am not here to save the world, just to try to understand it. 
This is why I am not a huge fan of Matt Stoller. He has campaigned against the collapse in anti-trust enforcement in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; for ages, without making any impact, that I can discern.
But his stuff is interesting, in a way, because he sometimes mentions companies that operate in markets that you&amp;#8217;d think would have negligible barriers to entry.
Such as meat processing or tree growing.
But you&amp;#8217;d be wrong. &lt;a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/counterfeit-capitalism-why-a-monopolized?utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=copy"&gt;His latest piece&lt;/a&gt; mentions a few. 
Wyerhauser ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WY&lt;/span&gt;) appealed to me. When lumber futures went up like a rocket earlier this year, I could not understand why much, much cheaper Canadian lumber could not be trucked into the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;.
Well, somehow $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WY&lt;/span&gt; executives have found a way of blocking them off, or buying up the transport, or paying them to keep out.
The net result should be good for its bottom line. The neat thing is that its share price hasn&amp;#8217;t gone anywhere in five years.
As always, this is absolutely not investment advice.
&lt;img src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/PYdgMplr/" width=750&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve read a lot about China lately.
Their vaccine seems to be pretty rubbish, and their lockdown enthusiasm seems less effective against the Delta Variant than against the earlier strains of Covid.
Xi Jin Ping has decided to declare war on videogames, and consumer-facing tech.
&lt;a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Red-Roulette/Desmond-Shum/9781982156152"&gt;Red Roulette&lt;/a&gt; is getting a lot of attention. 
The &amp;#8216;revelation&amp;#8217; seems to be that China has turned into a hereditary dictatorship, with an elite cadre formed from the offspring of the earlier leaders plundering the economy for their own ends.
Anyone who has ever been to Macao, or has read about who are the most important buyers of property in Belgravia, would not be surprised to hear that the Chinese leadership is just as corrupt and oligarchic as Russia&amp;#8217;s. 
It&amp;#8217;s hard for a country with a corrupt government to achieve sustained economic growth. 
China has done surprisingly well, but it has had a strong tailwind for a long time.
Although the globalists are not yet defeated, the popular distrust of the Davos agenda is increasing.
At some point, China will cease growing at 6.6% pa, and the disparity between what is seen on the ground and what is recorded in official statistics will be too great for anyone to&amp;nbsp;ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The boomer one controls the government, says&amp;nbsp;Elmer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://elmerspud.substack.com/p/fed-presidents-and-school-lunches"&gt;Elmer Spud has a bit of a rant&lt;/a&gt; about the true awfulness of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; politics.
He points out that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; is rigged to reward a very small section of society, because politics has been captured by that section.
It&amp;#8217;s pretty ugly. He&amp;nbsp;writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does it end? I don’t know that it does, at least until the boomers die off. Until then, I suspect that inflated asset prices and pro-upper-class policies will be maintained so that boomers can liquidate their 401ks and sell their houses to fund shuffleboard at a Florida condo in their golden years. And once they die off, Millennials and Gen Z will be left to pick up the pieces. At least I think that the younger generations see through the bullshit a bit more clearly and hopefully have a bit more empathy towards their fellow&amp;nbsp;citizen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, before it ends, what does it mean for asset prices? They continue going up, I guess. J Powell looks pretty healthy for a guy of his age, and he won&amp;#8217;t want to let the air out of the bubble for a few more years. 
It&amp;#8217;s hard to guess exactly which asset classes will benefit. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; feeds most directly into bonds, if the Cantillon Effect is real, so bond prices should go up first.
Well, yields on long dated bonds are heading straight to zero (nominal) and seriously negative (real). It&amp;#8217;s hard for them to keep going up.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasuries are the collateral used by the whole world, but somehow banks just want to keep their assets as reserves at the Fed. 
Stocks have been the beneficiaries. I guess they will continue to be, but maybe there will be a rotation out of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Elmer points out, at some point, the old order will change, and Millenials will start to run the economy. 
Something tells me that they will not have the same objectives as Jo and&amp;nbsp;Jerome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/"&gt;the Sensational Alex Manzara Band&lt;/a&gt; had&amp;nbsp;it,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small dip in stocks yesterday as Kaplan and Rosengren exited longs and shifted into &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FI&lt;/span&gt;. Who says that regional Fed Presidents can’t influence&amp;nbsp;markets?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Monetary_Metals/status/1435630252500393985"&gt;The thread he mentions&lt;/a&gt; is worth reading too. The allusion to &amp;#8220;the euthanasia of the rentier&amp;#8221; is wonderful.
It explains that by flooding the economy with liquidity, savers are forced into pure speculation. 
Certainly, I increasingly see all asset markets as driven largely by &amp;#8216;hot money&amp;#8217; flows, rather than by any fundamentals. 
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFT&lt;/span&gt; Cyberpunks phenomenon, and generally the crypto mania are examples, as are the rise of meme stocks and SPACs. 
I have no idea when it will end, or exactly how, but I feel sure that it will not be pretty when it&amp;nbsp;does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Covid&amp;nbsp;policy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;COVID&lt;/span&gt; policy has become purely &lt;em&gt;ad hoc&lt;/em&gt; and reactive. There&amp;#8217;s no strategy, there&amp;#8217;s no endgame, there&amp;#8217;s no philosophy, there&amp;#8217;s no internal consistency, there&amp;#8217;s no cost-benefit analysis, there&amp;#8217;s no metrics to define success, there&amp;#8217;s no consensus on what we want to accomplish. - Nate&amp;nbsp;Silver&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this comment could be made for policy on a range of topics. Immigration, perhaps, taxation, certainly, healthcare, probably.
One could say that Covid is new, so politicians haven&amp;#8217;t had time to formulate a coherent policy around it.
But it&amp;#8217;s just an infectious disease. We&amp;#8217;ve had them since the dawn of time.
Politics is largely about making decisions on matters where there is non consensus on an objective, quantitative metric.
That&amp;#8217;s why health policy debate never dares even make a passing reference to &amp;#8220;quality adjusted life&amp;nbsp;years.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Boomer&amp;nbsp;stocks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t really think (or write) about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESG&lt;/span&gt; funds, or bitcoin investing.
My priors, which say that capital should be deployed in the highest return investments, can&amp;#8217;t cope with these things.
The reality, though, is that huge torrents of cash is flowing into fads and Ponzis, so one would be well advised to avoid these things going off the radar.
As Kuppy memorably said, &amp;#8220;Fraud &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; alpha!&amp;#8221; Well, certainly economic rents are alpha, and maybe fraud&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was a risk off day. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; was down 65bp, as were nearly all developed markets bourses. 
The drumbeat of accelerating inflation is becoming louder. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PPI&lt;/span&gt; was over 8% yesterday, going up 70bp in a month.
I guess the market is pricing in a chance of early tapering.
Krugman wrote a piece yesterday saying that we&amp;#8217;ve had spikes of inflation in the past, notably in the 50s and we&amp;#8217;ll have them in the future and that they are nothing to worry about unless expectations become entrenched, as they were in the 1970s and they are in Brazil and Turkey. 
He knows a lot, but I feel that the Fed doesn&amp;#8217;t have the tools it needs or, rather, that it does have the tools but it dare not use them for fear of crashing the economy.
Maybe I&amp;#8217;m completely wrong, but it&amp;#8217;s interesting that bonds didn&amp;#8217;t respond at all to the inflation news.
Commodities were generally up, especially &amp;#8220;green&amp;#8221; metals, such as uranium, nickel and copper.
Precious metals were flat to down, reflecting a confidence that we will not see real rates&amp;nbsp;rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; was up strongly. Maybe it will finally break&amp;nbsp;out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we can all agree that it&amp;#8217;s kinda scary, when the earnings of the biggest, most global companies in the world cannot raise their earnings yield above the rate of&amp;nbsp;inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairly risk-off again. Commodities weak, especially oil. 
Bonds strong, 10Y now at 1.3% yield.
Currencies showing risk off traits: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPY&lt;/span&gt; up 0.5%.
No obvious trigger. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt; has said it&amp;#8217;s slowing down it&amp;#8217;s buying of bonds, but keeping its balance sheet at its current size until at least next March.
Presumably, the continuing disruption due to Covid is the cause. 
I had a chat in the pub last night, and I have to say that I was quite surprised at how cautious the group was about having life &amp;#8220;returning to normal.&amp;#8221;
I cannot see things being fully back to normal for at least another six&amp;nbsp;months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Health and social care&amp;nbsp;bill&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Health and social care&amp;nbsp;bill&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Economist magazine has a good summary of the latest Boris (possible) blunder, &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/boris-johnson-at-last-grasps-the-nettle-of-social-care-reform/21804364"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
The headlines focus on the idea that the new bill is going to “&amp;#8221;fix the crisis in social care once and for all&amp;#8221;, but the reality is that it&amp;#8217;s just a fairly stiff rise in taxes on employment to raise money the large bulk of which will just get tipped into the black hole of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt;. 
I know that the Conservatives are supposed to be the party whose whole function is to resist radical reform, but the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; really is pretty terrible.
Throwing money at it has been tried before, in the early 2000s, without any dramatic improvement, at least in the rather important area of keeping people&amp;nbsp;alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Forced conversion to Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) is imposed on manufacturers but resisted by customers and is bankrupting&amp;nbsp;governments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://atlantico.fr/article/decryptage/salon-de-munich---l-electrique-s-impose-chez-les-constructeurs-mais-les-clients-boudent-et-les-etats-se-ruinent-en-subventions-automobile-industrie-avenir-jean-marc-sylvestre"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; points out the problems with BEVs. Governments are forcing them on manufacturers, but to persuade customers to buy them is ruinously expensive. It&amp;#8217;s like the idea that we can all be persuaded to go on a diet of spinach, for its health benefits, by a government that is prepared to subsidise its production sufficiently, and pay for it by taxing ice cream. 
It is a delusion.
The sentiments are not so remarkable, but the fact that France, generally an exemplar when it comes to reducing carbon emissions, is increasingly sceptical.
If the French, who can charge up their EVs with clean power from nukes, which have to run 24x7, what hope is there for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; or Chinese consumers, who largely get electricity from burning fossil&amp;nbsp;fuels?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Going into competition with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; home&amp;nbsp;buyers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renting in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; is expensive. 
It used to be cheap, but for reasons I don&amp;#8217;t fully understand it has got a lot dearer.
The crash of 2008 and the trend for millions of young males to play video games in their parents&amp;#8217; basements has been a drag on demand.
But supply will have contracted to.
House builders, like Pulte Homes, have to contend with expensive carry, demand risk, skyrocketing labour and lumber costs.
But residential REITs don&amp;#8217;t have these problems. 
With ultra-cheap funding costs, and very strong demand from a labour market on the move, the narrative seems very&amp;nbsp;positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slate did a hatchet job on some of these firms, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/business/2021/06/blackrock-invitation-houses-investment-firms-real-estate.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
I sympathise with the sentiment, but I am more interested in what is, rather than what should be.
I came across the piece after reading &lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/but-i-have-a-reservation/"&gt;Alex Manzara&amp;#8217;s latest post&lt;/a&gt;.
Blackstone is an incredible institution. It has immense lobbying power, as Mazara indicates, which translates into economic power.
I suspect that Blackstone is more important than the composition of Powell&amp;#8217;s portfolio, when it comes to persuading the Fed to keep&amp;nbsp;printing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of job openings in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; rose by 749K to a new series high of 10.9 million in July, and well above market expectations of 10.0 million.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; government really thinking about thinking about letting the economy run hot.
Remarkably, bonds barely moved. Equities (which one would have thought would benefit from an economy running above fully employment levels) sank, but not by much.
Most commodities were higher, especially the oil complex, but this is just a catch up from weakness earlier in the week.
The dollar was a bit stronger, but nothing major: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt;, at 92.7, was up 0.2%, not enough to depress commodities.
Overall, this was a risk neutral&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This anim shows how house prices have changed over the last couple of hundred years.
Today is an absolutely terrible time to buy, from a investment point of view.
But, this is the very time that you people are being pushed into buying like never before, 
with endless special offers on mortgages and parents convinced that house prices can never go&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMMO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gundigest.com/gear-ammo/ammunition/the-end-of-an-era-the-russian-ammo-ban-and-its-consequences"&gt;Cheap Russian ammo is being banned from being imported into the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/a&gt; Probably bullish for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; ammo manufacturers. Vista Outdoor ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VSTO&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYSE&lt;/span&gt;), Olin Corp ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OLN&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYSE&lt;/span&gt;) and Ammo Inc ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;POWW&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PINK&lt;/span&gt;) seem the best bets.
&lt;a href="https://investorplace.com/2020/09/3-ammunition-stocks-to-buy-as-gun-sales-surge/"&gt;This page&lt;/a&gt; has some rather dated background on the&amp;nbsp;companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Japan is back&amp;nbsp;(maaaybe)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TOPIX&lt;/span&gt; has had a bit of a spike lately.
Given the terrible hangover from the &amp;#8216;92 crash (see yesterday&amp;#8217;s post), one has almost given up on the country.
However, these companies have had nearly three decades to restructure, and some at least must be clear of the awful legacy of the balance sheet recession.
However, reports of the revival of Japan have been an annual staple for a very long&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One factor, which must be important, is BoJ buying of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TOPIX&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;ETFs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BOJ&lt;/span&gt; now owns ~7% of aggregate market cap in Japan, and we have a year-long lookback to evaluate their program after buying came to a screeching halt. To answer Fama’s question of how much does it take for the government to move the market: 7% in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; inflows may have been enough in Japan. With the rest of developed world equity markets at &amp;gt;50% passive now, it is possible there are other, equally unpredictable and even bigger whales tails from long-term fund flow trends that can’t continue in&amp;nbsp;perpetuity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read more &lt;a href="https://mailchi.mp/verdadcap/a-whale-of-a-tail-the-bank-of-japans-etf-hoard-part-ii?e=1ed3cf5a25"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wars on abstract&amp;nbsp;nouns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m against all wars on abstract nouns. 
By their very nature, they are unwinnable. 
&amp;#8220;Terror&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;Drugs&amp;#8221; always win in the end. 
But they do have winners, which are the people who are paid by taxpayers for waging the war.
Increasingly, for &amp;#8220;terror&amp;#8221; this is arms manufacturers.
The sums are staggering.
&lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/09/01/war-on-terror-deaths-cost/?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=The%20Intercept%20Newsletter"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; estimates that the cost has been of the order of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; 8 trillion (yes, that&amp;#8217;s $8e12 in a sensible notation).
Voters are finally waking up and saying &amp;#8220;enough is enough.&amp;#8221;
I feel that the next war will be on infectious disease. 
I know that no government feels safe without a war to wage on &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; enemy!
Maybe it&amp;#8217;s time to rotate from Lockheed to&amp;nbsp;Pfizer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Degrowth is&amp;nbsp;bonkers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it&amp;#8217;s not so much bonkers as politically undeliverable.
&lt;a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/people-are-realizing-that-degrowth"&gt;This post explains why.&lt;/a&gt;
For a start, you&amp;#8217;d have to get China to stall the improvements in living standards for its people (and it&amp;#8217;s global economic heft).
This is simply not going to happen, and it if doesn&amp;#8217;t happen in China, it&amp;#8217;s not going to happen in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="19c10cae729ea4e851a52c82ad6168f0.png" src="19c10cae729ea4e851a52c82ad6168f0.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Big Brother is watching you, from&amp;nbsp;above&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/09/01/fbi-spy-plane-alazhari-surveillance/"&gt;Drone surveillance really is a&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Elmer&amp;#8217;s Spudstack is&amp;nbsp;back&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://elmerspud.substack.com/"&gt;Here it is.&lt;/a&gt; It&amp;#8217;s always worth reading.
Tips recently include $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HEAR&lt;/span&gt; (Turtle Beach) and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;APRN&lt;/span&gt; (Blue Apron).
Blue Apron is an interesting&amp;nbsp;company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/8LCVSsbn/" alt="$APRN on Trading View"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see why Elmer&amp;nbsp;says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly its embarrassing for any company to have an $100 million market cap in this day and age. Just put Bitcoin or Crypto or SaaS or Green Energy or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EV&lt;/span&gt; or Battery or something in your company’s name and you’ll be worth billions. But there is one little guy that I’ve been following for a while which I like to trade in and out of - and I am getting back in&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;APRN&lt;/span&gt; came onto the market as a hot &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IPO&lt;/span&gt; - well done management and underwriters - and has since withered away to nothing as the food delivery box business has proved to not be that&amp;nbsp;fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It&amp;#8217;s really hard to understand what incentives J Powell has to raise&amp;nbsp;rates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://themarket.ch/english/skin-in-the-game-fomc-style-ld.4794?mc_cid=f89e2d6a75&amp;amp;mc_eid=8d66df2c11"&gt;Yup, it sure&amp;nbsp;is.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Equity markets considered highly inelastic with respect to&amp;nbsp;demand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://mailchi.mp/verdadcap/the-butterfly-effect"&gt;This paper&lt;/a&gt; is pretty amazing, if true.
It suggests that rather than stock market prices being independent of demand, they are actually highly sensitive to them.
I remember George Soros writing that he&amp;#8217;d given up the study of economics, because it seemed to have no bearing on the price of stocks.
I guess he was referring to microeconomics, where a commodity has a supply and a demand schedule that intersect at the observed (clearing) price.
The added complication of passive investing may explain why stock market moves have been so irrational of&amp;nbsp;late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think that Elon Musk knows much about engineering, but I suspect that he understands this inelasticity effect all too well. 
Especially for stocks with a very limited free&amp;nbsp;float.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spoofing the&amp;nbsp;world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/spoofing-the-world/"&gt;Alex Manzara&lt;/a&gt; is simply one of the best commentators I know.
He doesn&amp;#8217;t have substack, he doesn&amp;#8217;t pump cryptos, he is not a media person, he doesn&amp;#8217;t have a big profile,
but he writes a phenomenal post every single trading&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His recent one (linked above) highlights the fact that Russia is getting worried about inflation, and that the Chinese are serious about redistribution.
He also points out that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NY&lt;/span&gt; Fed has suspended publication of their &amp;#8216;nowcast&amp;#8217; model of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;, because they don&amp;#8217;t have a clue what is happening.
Except that they are totally sure that inflation is&amp;nbsp;transitory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other laugh is that Biden, in his chat to the kleptocrat who was previously in charge of Afghanistan, was emphasising the &lt;em&gt;perception&lt;/em&gt; that he was not actually in control of the situation. Not the reality, just the&amp;nbsp;perception!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We seem to be still suffering from the poor jobs report.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; equities were weak, the dollar was up a little, yields globally were up a tad (except Japan), 
commodities were weak to neutral.
The feeling seems to be that a weak jobs report will make the Fed delay tapering, which will increase inflation, which will push up (nominal) yields.
I find this difficult to comprehend, because generally yields go up when the economy is run&amp;nbsp;hot.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>In politics, you dance with them that brung you!</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/in-politics-you-dance-with-them-that-brung-you.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-09-06T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:59+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-09-06:/in-politics-you-dance-with-them-that-brung-you.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;6 Sept&amp;nbsp;2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Better living through electric&amp;nbsp;cars&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;, like Europe, is determined to replace &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICE&lt;/span&gt; cars with BEVs (battery electric vehicles).
Consumers are waking up to the limitations of these cars, which results in sales being weaker than forecast.
The result, inevitably, will be bigger subsidies,

That&amp;#8217;s why Biden&amp;#8217;s presser excluded Tesla, a non-union shop, but included representatives from much smaller &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EV&lt;/span&gt; makers which do run union shops.
Biden may be gaga, but he knows which side his bread is buttered on: as the article says &amp;#8220;You dance with them that brung&amp;nbsp;you!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Repo madness part&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know that the Fed has been creating a lot of money.
&lt;a href="https://wallstreetonparade.com/2021/08/the-fed-just-published-36-years-of-its-money-data-it-shows-a-spike-in-repo-loans-is-an-early-warning-of-an-impending-market-crash/"&gt;This article tries to set the scale of the money creation into some sort of contex.&lt;/a&gt;
It takes a pessimistic view, but my take is that as the dollar is a reserve currency, this train is not stopping any time&amp;nbsp;soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An important anniversary, only a few weeks&amp;nbsp;late&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://moneyinsideout.exantedata.com/p/the-end-of-bretton-woods-after-fifty"&gt;Chris Marsh has written on the topic of the international monetary system on the fiftieth anniversary of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; closing the gold&amp;nbsp;window.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; wakes up to the expense of the Afghan&amp;nbsp;war&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thesoundingline.com/the-us-could-have-paid-every-single-afghani-the-average-wage-for-150-years-and-saved-money/"&gt;# The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Could Have Paid Every Single Afghani the Average Wage for 150 Years and Saved Money&lt;/a&gt;.
Yep, you read this right.
I don&amp;#8217;t even know if the calculation is accurate, you just know that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; spending dwarfed any conceivable output of the Afghan economy, including lucrative opium growing.
Well, even for heroin, must of the value is added by the supply chain, not the&amp;nbsp;grower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Maintaining the&amp;nbsp;bid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buybacks now account for around two thirds the cashflow return to shareholders for shares in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt;.
This is more than I remembered. Some detail is provided &lt;a href="https://www.yardeni.com/pub/buybackdiv.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; [warning: pdf download] by Yardeni Research.
This is pretty extraordinary, as until 1982 buybacks were prohibited by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; company law as being a form of stock price manipulation.
I&amp;#8217;m afraid to say that all the evidence is that they are indeed a stock price manipulation.
By bidding for stock whenever the price falls, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; equities have achieved far higher P/E ratios than stocks in markets where this practice is illegal.
The negative real interest rates on corporate debt in the last ten years has turbocharged this&amp;nbsp;practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="9481d55e5bdc1d16ce42d0e7e8376cca.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/9481d55e5bdc1d16ce42d0e7e8376cca.png"&gt;
Well, a tsunami of buybacks are coming, so in case you were thinking of shorting anything,&amp;nbsp;beware!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just in case it needs to be said, nobody is doing buybacks for&amp;nbsp;commodities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Buy stocks in suppliers to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EV&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;industry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/electric-vehicle-boom-is-pay-dirt-factory-machinery-makers-2021-08-20/"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; points out that auto manufacturers are pouring an insane amount of money into factories to buy electric vehicles.
Many commentators have expressed scepticism that there will be enough buyers.
But one thing is certain: the factories being built will be equipped with robots and paintshops, and even if nobody buys the cars, the firms that build robots and paintshops will be paid.
Interesting plays might include $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROK&lt;/span&gt;.N (Rockwell Automation), $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DUEG&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DE&lt;/span&gt; (Durr &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AG&lt;/span&gt;), 000333.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SZ&lt;/span&gt; (Midea, which owns a chunk of Kuka), &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KU2G&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DE&lt;/span&gt; (Kuka &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AG&lt;/span&gt;), 6954.T (Fanuc) and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MG&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TO&lt;/span&gt; (Magna, parts rather than factories).
If you have some inside knowledge of this industry, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HMU&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fed rates are too low, according to the Taylor&amp;nbsp;Rule&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Computing the cost of&amp;nbsp;Wars&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://adamtooze.substack.com/p/chartbook-34-how-we-paid-for-the"&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not as easy as it should&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is Japan that&amp;nbsp;different?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://themacrocompass.substack.com/p/japan"&gt;A brilliant post by Macro Alf&lt;/a&gt; says &amp;#8220;it may be.&amp;#8221;
Japan has never managed to get real private sector rates down as far as it needed to restart the private sector levering up, as it did in the early 90&amp;#8217;s.
All the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; and Fiscal policies have failed to get the private sector borrowing and consuming.
This is a very fine overview.
As it says at the end, the big unknown is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CBDC&lt;/span&gt;. 
I await their arrival with bated&amp;nbsp;breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thesoundingline.com/the-myth-of-monetary-policy-exposed-in-three-charts/?utm_source=mailpoet&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=new-post-the-myth-of-monetary-policy-exposed-in-three-charts_825"&gt;As Taps Coogan points out, monetary policy cannot do anything to change the real output of the&amp;nbsp;economy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macro Alf is one of my favourite commentators. His substack is free, but it would be worth paying for if it were&amp;nbsp;not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="7c58a81c91f4479427448da26cdfdf35.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/7c58a81c91f4479427448da26cdfdf35.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Do Audits&amp;nbsp;matter?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thedig.substack.com/p/if-markets-move-on-stories-and-momentum"&gt;Probably not.&lt;/a&gt;
Auditors always claim that they are not employed to detect fraud. 
It&amp;#8217;s a bit unclear what they are there for, but the law requires audits to be done, and so they are done.
The incentives for auditors to probe deeply are totally absent so, surprise surprise, they don&amp;#8217;t.
But they (or other group companies) can get lots of lucrative advisory fees, as long as they don&amp;#8217;t rock the&amp;nbsp;boat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The war in Afghanistan was run by clones of the Pointy Haired&amp;nbsp;Manager&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/the-war-in-afghanistan-is-what-happens"&gt;Yup, it&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;true.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;War Machine,&lt;/em&gt; McMahan comes to Afghanistan with a spirited can do attitude and a frat house of hard-partying yes-men, after having ‘kicked Al Qaeda in the sack’ running special operations in Iraq. He is obsessed with inspirational speeches and weird bureaucratic box-ticking, under the amorphous concept of leadership. This kind of leadership, though, isn’t actually working with wisdom and foresight, but is more like management consulting. Prior to arriving in Afghanistan, for instance, McMahan created a system, with the acronym &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNORPP&lt;/span&gt; to coordinate military assets. At night, he cozies down to read books on management excellence, the kind that Harvard Business Review publishes as sort of Chicken Soup for the Executive’s Soul. He is also the author of a fictional book with the amazing title, “One Leg At a Time: Just Like Everybody&amp;nbsp;Else.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; markets were largely closed today (Labor Day). 
Futures did seem to be open, but there can&amp;#8217;t have been much volume.
German factory orders increased by 3.4%, MoM, which gave a boost to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; equities.
Aluminium and lumber futures were strong, oil was weak, uranium continues its upward trajectory.
$U.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UN&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSE&lt;/span&gt; (Sprott Physical U Trust) was up 5.44% last week, and is likely to rise tomorrow.
Evergrande bonds were suspended on one of the China&amp;nbsp;exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an interesting article in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; over the weekend about Zhang Beili, former wife of Wen Jiabao, former &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt; of China.
It&amp;#8217;s all written up in a book called &lt;em&gt;Red Roulette&lt;/em&gt; but the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TL&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DR&lt;/span&gt; version seems to be that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PRC&lt;/span&gt; is a kleptocracy, just like all the other notionally communist countries.

&lt;h2&gt;The&amp;nbsp;week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resignation of Suga, the Japanese &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt;, seems to have had a galvanizing effect on the Japanese stock market.

&lt;h2&gt;The&amp;nbsp;week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resignation of Suga, the Japanese &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt;, seems to have had a galvanizing effect on the Japanese stock market. 
I don&amp;#8217;t know anything about the politics over there.
My understanding was that he was just a caretaker &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt;, brought in because Abe became too ill to carry on.
I assume that there will be no change in ruling party, which presumably means more of the same stagnation.
Anyway, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TOPIX&lt;/span&gt; was&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; equity markets ground higher. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; stocks (Russell 3000) are up 18% &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YTD&lt;/span&gt;.
It&amp;#8217;s amazing what the Fed can achieve.
Further gains this week were presumably a reaction to the payrolls print. 
Weak employment growth would imply delayed tapering, and so the band plays&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big beneficiary of this monetary policy is real assets, specifically real estate. 
REITs are up 40% YoY. 
This is great news for Blackrock, not so great for ordinary voters who see a house as a place to live, not a financial investment.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; has had a similar boost in house prices, with the result that a number of institutions (most visibly, Lloyds Bank) have decided to invest.
Nothing goes on forever, but even if nominal rates go up, it seems likely that real estate will keep going. 
Supply of real estate responds very slowly to demand, in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; hardly at all because of the centrally planned economy in land development rights.
I think a basket of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; REITs would be worth looking at&amp;nbsp;closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As real assets go up, nominal ones tend to lose momentum.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; bonds ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IEF&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LQD&lt;/span&gt;) were down. 
I think credit instruments are the canary in the coal mine, but it&amp;#8217;s too early to call an end to the bull&amp;nbsp;run.&lt;/p&gt;

Short interest has never been lower. 
But just as a short squeeze can result in a rapid rise in the market, when all the shorts have capitulated, there is nobody left to sell but the passive&amp;nbsp;funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be nothing, but unlike interest rates, short interest cannot fall below&amp;nbsp;zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The age of&amp;nbsp;oligopoly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 19th Century was the age of steam power, the 20th Century was the age of the automobile, the 21st Century could well be shaping up as the age of oligopoly. 
&lt;img alt="44332002c9900fe2687ec077d2243e7b.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/44332002c9900fe2687ec077d2243e7b.png"&gt;
It doesn&amp;#8217;t have quite the same ring, and of course everyone thinks that we are living in the Internet Age. 
But the real power of the internet is to allow industries like brewing beer to organize on a global scale.
The way forward was shown by Coca Cola, which expanded globally on the back of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Army&amp;#8217;s global deployment in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WWII&lt;/span&gt;. 
Technologies like the humble container, fax, the telex, etc. all supported this global expansion.
The advertising industry, which includes companies like Google and Facebook, is suddenly global,
although many advertising agencies had led the way in an earlier&amp;nbsp;generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As industries became more concentrated, their lobbying power increased, and they were able to de-fang anti-trust legislation that would otherwise have impeded their progress.
Maybe the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; will prove resistant to this sort of corporatism, but I wouldn&amp;#8217;t hold my breath.
One suspects that the reason the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; has opposed the expansion of some global industries is that there are no national champions in these sectors based in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;.
Once there are, world markets will continue to be carved up into a small number of pieces, I&amp;nbsp;predict.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s about why economics, and particularly property rights are behind a  lot of the violence in the country.
It&amp;#8217;s about how the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; invasion lead to a reinstatement of the earlier, centralized, soviet-style governance that had been put in place after the coup in 1978.
It&amp;#8217;s about land reform, needed, but botched, had lead to a deep suspicion of the state machinery from enforcing and recording property rights.
It&amp;#8217;s about how the Afghans much prefer &amp;#8220;customary rights&amp;#8221; over centrally determined property rights, because the court system is corrupt and extractive.
It&amp;#8217;s about how after 20 years, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; has left a failed state in which fifty percent of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; is derived from aid.
It&amp;#8217;s a very sad story, but it&amp;#8217;s much more informative than anything I&amp;#8217;ve seen on the mainstream&amp;nbsp;media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a huge miss in the Non-farm Payrolls figure: 235K vs 750K expected. 
Under normal circumstances, this would have resulted in a crash in yield and in the equity market.
In fact, the two markets barely budged. 
I guess it&amp;#8217;s the famous ability of the market to look through temporary blips.
Almost certainly, the delta variant will burn itself out and we&amp;#8217;ll return to something approaching normal.
The one market that did react was oil, down&amp;nbsp;~1%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For individual stocks and commodities, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; was up against all the odds. 
There are increasing signs that the regulators are looking more carefully as &amp;#8220;Full Self Driving.&amp;#8221;
Some commodity plays did well: $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CCO&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSE&lt;/span&gt;), $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TECK&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RRC&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SD&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting one is $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;INMB&lt;/span&gt;.This is working on a treatment for Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s Disease. 
I don&amp;#8217;t know enough about the biochemistry to know if it will work, but the idea that the disease has an autoimmune origin seems appealing to me, 
and having some sort of option on a treatment for what is probably the world&amp;#8217;s most serious human disease seems worth having, 
even if it is way out of the&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real pandemic we face is autoimmune diseases. Many chronic conditions, such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Hashimoto&amp;#8217;s autoimmune thyroiditis, celiac diseas, Graves&amp;#8217; disease, vitiligo, rheumatic fever, pernicious anemia, and alopecia areata are autoimmune in origin, and are very serious indeed.
There are very many others, affecting almost every organ in the&amp;nbsp;body.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Uranium SPUTters, but in a good way</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/uranium-sputters-but-in-a-good-way.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-09-02T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:59+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-09-02:/uranium-sputters-but-in-a-good-way.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;2&amp;nbsp;Sept&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Uranium&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuppy is pumping uranium, &lt;a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2021/09/02/the-new-gbtc/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. 
He&amp;#8217;s keeping to his theme of sticking to investing in Ponzi-like schemes. 
One sure sign of one is an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATM&lt;/span&gt; (at the money)&amp;nbsp;offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, Kuppy&amp;#8217;s main point is that the above-ground stockpile of uranium is being used up at a hell of a lick.
The other thing, not sure he focusses on it, is that uranium is an energy material that is zero carbon.
Traditionally, the Greenpeaces of this world have been against nuclear power.
It has a lot of problems, not least of which is that excessive risk aversion has lead to unaffordable energy.
But the rest of the energy production scene is catching up with this, so maybe U&amp;#8217;s day in the sun is&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a commodity, though, uranium is a reflation play. All such plays have been crushed recently, so my guess is that the time is not yet ripe.
A few more months of high &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPI&lt;/span&gt;, though, and it may&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairly risk on again. Initial jobless claims below expectations, exports up, imports down, labour costs up, all in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;.
Treasury yields holding the line (1.3% for the 10Y), but commodities, especially U, oil complex, and coal going up.
Even copper started to catch a bid. Kuppy was prescient: uranium was up 3% on the day, but some producers were up by much&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Japanification&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robin Harding wrote in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; the other day about why it was that Japan had not experienced any inflation, in spite of a rapidly aging population, which should have given rise to labour shortages. 
He quoted some academic literature which suggested that the reason was that increasing inequality had created an excess pool of liquidity, which had driven down interest rates. 
Basically, all the wealth was held by very rich people who had a very low propensity to spend, and that this had offset the labour market tightness.

&lt;p&gt;“Evergrande is the largest player in the largest sector in the Chinese economy.  Evergrande owns 231 million sq meters of land in 234 cities.  Evergrande is the largest Chinese issuer of dollar-denominated corporate debt in the world, with a balance sheet of more than $350&amp;nbsp;billion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;– From Epsilon&amp;nbsp;Theory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is $350 billion a lot? Hmm, I think so, even today.
China is a paradox, wrapped up in an enigma. 
It is a communist country which has an absolutely stonking stock market, that has defied gravity for&amp;nbsp;decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country has a lot of physical infrastructure, real investment in real things. 
But most of this was financed with debt, much of which must be close to default.
The problem is that a major economic downturn would be extremely embarrassing for Xi Jin Ping, and nobody even pretends that the central bank is independent, so probably this debt will continue to be fine, at least&amp;nbsp;systemically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China is hugely important for the world economy, as a source of supply, but also as a source of demand. If it goes down, there is no way that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; will avoid going down with&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s hope Xi Jin Ping has had both his vaccinations, and that he didn&amp;#8217;t have the Sinopharm&amp;nbsp;one!&lt;/p&gt;

House price inflation continues to outpace wage&amp;nbsp;inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally pretty risk on. Bonds flattish, no big moves in currencies, aluminium and natural gas on the move, China bouncing back (intervention?), house construction sector&amp;nbsp;strong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Housing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The massive strength of the housing and rental market strongly suggests landlords will try to evict tenants who are delinquent on rent unless they obtain federal assistance. And evictions could be particularly pronounced in cities hardest hit by the coronacrisis, since apartment markets are actually tighter in those cities. Goldman: &amp;#8220;We estimate 2½-3½mn households significantly behind on rent and at risk of eviction without policy support. Eviction Lab data indicate that roughly half of eviction filings historically result in eviction (47% over 2006-2016), and in our remaining analyses, we assume that barring a new eviction ban from Congress or a much faster pace of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ERA&lt;/span&gt; distribution, 750k households will face eviction in the fall and winter months. With 8-9mn Americans currently unemployed and emergency unemployment programs winding down, the sudden loss of tenant protections could plausibly generate an eviction episode of this&amp;nbsp;magnitude&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Source: Goldman Sachs" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/fbb84b9789b4f641fb7f21da4debde32.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above is from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;. Housing has done extremely well, in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, since the beginning of 2020. 
My feeling is that the market will cool off, but that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; and other loose money policies will prevent prices falling.
Supply constraints on everything from cement to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HGV&lt;/span&gt; drivers are likely to provide support for the market.
In the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, planning reform is always glacial, and so I cannot see the new policies promised by the Conservative government having any impact on supply for a&amp;nbsp;decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sentiment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was browsing on Seeking Alpha when I stumbled across &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4452617-apples-stock-faces-a-massive-disconnect"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;. It makes the point that Apple&amp;#8217;s best years are behind it, that it will struggle to maintain growth when it already has, arguably, a monopoly position in many of the now-mature markets in which it operates, it faces regulatory scrutiny etc. etc. It then says that a P/E of 26 is unsustainable in such a&amp;nbsp;situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My response was &amp;#8220;Well, 26 doesn&amp;#8217;t seem too big, for a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; stock, and anyway, someone would have to have a death wish to short a stock like $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;APPL&lt;/span&gt;.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t claim to represent anyone, but I strongly suspect that most portfolio managers would be extremely wary of shorting large cap tech. As J M Keynes said, &lt;em&gt;Worldly wisdom teaches that it is better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally.&lt;/em&gt; Or, as people in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; industry used to say in the 1970&amp;#8217;s, &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Nobody ever got sacked for buying &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IBM&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, to stack up the quotes, &lt;em&gt;The old order changeth yielding place to new And God fulfills himself in many ways Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.&lt;/em&gt; The wheel turns, and Apple will fall. But probably not this&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coal, not dead&amp;nbsp;yet!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/fQQLbeBk/" alt="Rotterdam coal futures, YTD" width=750&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coal has had a stonking run this year, doubling. I read somewhere that we haven&amp;#8217;t even reached &amp;#8220;peak coal,&amp;#8221; let alone &amp;#8220;peak&amp;nbsp;oil.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know where all this coal is being burned. In power stations in South East Asia would be my guess. Oh, and&amp;nbsp;Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In equities, there seems to be a rotation into emerging markets and Japan.
In bonds, there is a slight weakness, but nothing major.
In currencies, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EUR&lt;/span&gt; has paused after its recent rally.
In commodities, precious metals began to shine, but pretty much everything else was dross.
Agricultural commodities have gone absolutely nowhere, in aggregate, all&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Everything is an option</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/everything-is-an-option.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-08-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:48+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-08-30:/everything-is-an-option.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;30 Aug&amp;nbsp;2021&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Navios Marine&amp;nbsp;Acquisition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/8oklduI1/" width=750 alt="NMM via Trading View"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This company, which is in the business of supplying all sorts of ships, had had a bad run lately. Over the last few days it has recovered. Its financials are a bit suspect. It has recently an at-the-market offering, which is favoured by the more … speculative stocks. Well, this sort of capital raise didn&amp;#8217;t harm Tesla, so maybe it&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NMM&lt;/span&gt;. You can read the latest &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt; piece &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4452257-navios-version-2-0-starting-to-take-shape"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It is certainly a very speculative&amp;nbsp;bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Everything is an&amp;nbsp;option&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a discounted dividend model, a company that earns nothing is worthless.
But this is not true in the real world. A company that owns a goldmine which is not producing anything, because it&amp;#8217;s marginal cost of production is less than the market price of gold, is not worthless. It is an option on gold prices rallying. The value of this sort of option is related for how long the options is available to be exercised, the volatility of the underlying (gold) and the current market price, together with the cost of&amp;nbsp;extraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of companies in the stock market are like this. 
They make no profits, but they may just be the next Apple. 
The vast majority will not be, of course, but a small investment in a lot of them might just be worth the&amp;nbsp;investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it&amp;#8217;s very hard to have a good model for this sort of value. 
It&amp;#8217;s not just a question of using Mathematica rather than Excel.
It&amp;#8217;s that the inputs are just known&amp;nbsp;unknowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it&amp;#8217;s not only stocks without income (or, in some cases, without revenue). It&amp;#8217;s every stock. SPACs have exploited this approach. The twist is that you pay the premium before you even know what the underlying is. But you receive a put, which you can exercise, to get your money back if you decide you think the option is&amp;nbsp;overpriced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that the regulators think that SPACs look a bit too much like regular investment funds, but with fees which break the rules for this sort of product. Bill Ackman has come up with an idea for getting around this that seems pretty good to me. He&amp;#8217;s offering investors in his original &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPAC&lt;/span&gt; nil-paid transferrable rights which can be exercised when he announces his target acquisition. 
You can read a bit about this &lt;a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/pershing-square-tontine-holdings-ltd-220000891.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. There was a good article about this in the Economist this weekend, but it&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;paywalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Market&amp;nbsp;update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets are still trending sideways. 
The plunge in oil has reversed. 
Some international indexes have recovered.
There seems to be some evidence that the backwardation in oil futures is closing.
It doesn&amp;#8217;t make sense to me that a few years out you will be able to buy oil for $54 a barrel. 
We&amp;#8217;re not close to running the economy on wind power&amp;nbsp;yet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The schools will be going back next week.

&lt;p&gt;August is sometimes a month when markets melt down.
It was the month that the First World War got started.
This August doesn&amp;#8217;t look like it&amp;#8217;ll be one of those.
Markets are lacking direction, financial journalists have nothing to write about, so fall back on the old&amp;nbsp;chestnuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;, Helen Thomas wrote about how the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s dysfunctional planning system is failing to deliver enough warehouses. You can read the piece &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9582767d-49fe-43e5-afe1-372fd6f1dd22"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
The essence of the problem is that planners care only about houses. 
It is assumed that infrastructure for jobs and transport will materialize out of thin air.
Our planning system probably takes a few tens of bps off our growth every year, with the result that we are a lot less well off now than we would have been if the 1947 Act had never been&amp;nbsp;passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip Coggan, always worth reading, sums up the problem with markets &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/95fd431f-fd97-4380-9349-5a3261f46f39"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. He has got old warning about how bad the system is, but it just keeps pushing down interest rates and pushing up asset prices.
He writes about the insanity of investing in SPACs and cryptocurrencies, evoking parallels with the South Sea Bubble. 
But the modern era is a rolling series of bubbles, which never fully deflate, but nevertheless weigh down the economy with zombie asset&amp;nbsp;allocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Frontline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://alhambrapartners.com/2021/07/30/eurodollar-universitys-making-more-sense-episode-92-frontlines-power-of-the-fed-wouldve-been-powerful-criticism-had-it-not-blindly-swallowed-easy-money/"&gt;This episode&lt;/a&gt; is notionally about what a documentary film about the Fed got wrong.
But it&amp;#8217;s a great summary of Snider&amp;#8217;s thesis that we&amp;#8217;ve got the Fed all wrong: that it&amp;#8217;s actually powerless to affect the real economy, except to the extent that it can sway sentiment.
I am becoming more and more convinced that sentiment is a much more important determinant of how markets behave than I&amp;#8217;d previously understood.
Exhibit A is Bitcoin. 
This is one of many tens of thousands of cryptocurrencies, all of which share some essential features (mainly recording all transactions on a distributed ledger).
There is simply no reason why people should put their money in Bitcoin in preference to any other crypto.
&lt;em&gt;Except&lt;/em&gt; people understand that given an unprompted choice, most people will choose Bitcoin over the others &lt;em&gt;because that&amp;#8217;s exactly what they expect everyone else to do, even though they might privately harbour doubts about the choice&lt;/em&gt;.
Keynes&amp;#8217; idea about the market being like a beauty contents where the winner is the one who picks the most popular choice of model remains a deep insight into how markets&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snider addresses the problem I&amp;#8217;ve grappled with for a long time: why stocks? 
He thinks that with safe investments, such as deposit accounts at one&amp;#8217;s bank, being euthanized by the Fed, people are forced into risk assets and the ones that all fund managers divert them is stocks, because that&amp;#8217;s where they can charge the biggest fees. 
Well, private equity, hedge funds, venture capital etc. etc. are similar and have shown explosive growth.
I don&amp;#8217;t know whether this is the answer, but it&amp;#8217;s certainly a plausible hypothesis.
Crypto also has high fees for miners, so may be an exception that proves (tests) the&amp;nbsp;rule.&lt;/p&gt;

This is a cannabis company run by an experienced fraudster that is unlikely to produce any long-term return for shareholders.
Of course, it will probably go up like a rocket in the short term, so do your own research!

&lt;p&gt;Jackson Hole has had a case of Covid, with the result that, for the second year, it will be held over video.
I&amp;#8217;m sure the world&amp;#8217;s central bankers were awfully disappointed, but the planet will thank them for the kilotonnes of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CO&lt;/span&gt;~2~ production&amp;nbsp;avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#8217;s hard to beat Alex Manzara&amp;#8217;s commentary on Fed matters. 
&lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/taper-groundwork-is-set/"&gt;His recent piece&lt;/a&gt; is no exception.
He is saying that the Fed won&amp;#8217;t risk another Repo Madness (2019) episode again, at least in the bond markets.
He has said that the Fed will do everything in its power to pin short-term rates to the floor, which should naturally lead to a bit of steepening.
I&amp;#8217;ve been waiting for this for a while. 
We&amp;#8217;ve seen a few basis points increase in the 10Y recently, to approaching 1.4%, but I can&amp;#8217;t see that long-duration rates are going to exactly shoot&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manzara reckons that the slowing in the growth of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; might hit the equities market.
This seems more plausible to me, but remember that Manzara is a Fixed Income guy, not an equity guy, so he is a tourist as far as this asset class is concerned.
Sentiment still holds that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; stocks can only go up in price.
It&amp;#8217;s rational to think that this must be true, but irrationality can last a long time in the&amp;nbsp;markets.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>I don’t know why she swallowed a fly</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/i-dont-know-why-she-swallowed-a-fly.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-08-25T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:48+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-08-25:/i-dont-know-why-she-swallowed-a-fly.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;25 Aug&amp;nbsp;2021&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the inspirating for the title of a piece by Bill Nelson.
It&amp;#8217;s an academic piece, but he summarized it nicely &lt;a href="https://morningconsult.com/opinions/i-dont-know-why-she-swallowed-a-fly/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
It&amp;#8217;s saying more or less what &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RudyHavenstein"&gt;Rudy Havenstein&lt;/a&gt; has been saying on Twitter for a long while.
(No, it&amp;#8217;s not the real Rudy, just his&amp;nbsp;reincarnation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill explains that the Fed has repeatedly tried to fix problems. The problem is that these are mainly of its own creation. 
However, each fix results in a bigger problem, which in turn requires another fix.
It&amp;#8217;s like a doctor who keeps prescribing a new, more powerful drug, to combat the side effects. 
Each new drug is required to treat the side effects of an earlier treatment.
Nelson speaks with the authority that comes with having been a senior figure at the Fed in the past.
The most egregious problem is, obviously, the balance sheet, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; ∞. 
Nelson points out that, as in Japan, the Fed now &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the market for many securities, and any move it makes can create huge volatility.
The Fed itself expects that by 2023 the Fed balance sheet will be 39 percent of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;. It was six percent before the global financial&amp;nbsp;crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=GeAn alt="The Fed balance sheet" width="760px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can only wonder what it will be in 2033. Japan&amp;#8217;s BoJ now has a balance sheet which is several times the size of the&amp;nbsp;economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that the Fed knowsthat it has to reverse the ridiculous stack of programs it is now running. And that it has known this for a while.
But needs to manage this without spooking the markets: a tricky&amp;nbsp;operation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if the current heavy reverse repo program is part of this process.
(Reverse repos, are when banks swap reserves for T-bills. It&amp;#8217;s a Fed program, but it&amp;#8217;s named from the point of view of the banks.)

&lt;p&gt;Chinese stocks, including $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HSTECH&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KWEB&lt;/span&gt; are rallying. 
Maybe they&amp;#8217;ve gone down&amp;nbsp;enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities going nowhere. The dip last Friday has been comprehensively bought. 
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSCI&lt;/span&gt; (Goldman&amp;#8217;s commodity index) is back to where it was in early May.
Bonds pretty flat, on a week or so timeline.
The dollar is high, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt;=92, but has been higher (93.55 last week), and was around this level back in March.
10Y Treasury yields are back where they were a month&amp;nbsp;ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s hard to make money in such a meandering market.
Jackson Hole is happening this week.

For reasons I&amp;#8217;m a bit hazy about, when I installed Pelican via conda (just google it) I ended up with either version 3.7.0 or a screed of error&amp;nbsp;messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I decided to leap into the unknown and build+install the latest version from Github. 
It worked a dream. If you want to give it a go, just&amp;nbsp;paste:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;python -m pip install -e &amp;quot;git+https://github.com/getpelican/pelican.git#egg=pelican&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Net Interest is a wonderful blog. Marc Rubinstein is a smart cookie.

&lt;h2&gt;Afterpay&amp;nbsp;analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net Interest is a wonderful blog. Marc Rubinstein is a smart cookie.
I always enjoy his missives, but I enjoyed 
&lt;a href="https://www.netinterest.co/p/after-afterpay"&gt;this writeup of why Afterpay in particular, and why this sort of retail finance fintech is so sought after.&lt;/a&gt;
Afterpay has been snapped up by Square, for $33 billion.
That&amp;#8217;s a lot of&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People want a frictionless life nowadays. Having something automatically provide finance for a capital purchase is a nice thing.
It&amp;#8217;s not a new idea, and it hasn&amp;#8217;t always been profitable, but it makes a huge difference to the seller.
The article explains how the Singer Sewing Machine company achieved its dominance by providing finance.
The same was true of General Motors, which overtook Ford because old man Ford thought debt was&amp;nbsp;evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article referenced above has a link to another article Rubinstein has written about Klarna.
You can read it &lt;a href="https://www.netinterest.co/p/buy-now-pay-later"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. 
Key takeaways:
- Klarna is a bank, &amp;#8216;unashamedly&amp;#8217;,
- the merchant pays for the whole operation (6%, exactly the same figure as was used in the earliest days of the credit card), rather than having some consumers free-riding off others,
- the model is very cash flow positive &lt;em&gt;except for defaults,&lt;/em&gt; which run at 7.6%, even in a rapid growth, low interest rate&amp;nbsp;environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a fan of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BNPL&lt;/span&gt; companies. The seem an absurdly expensive way of getting credit. But I&amp;#8217;m not representative of the customers they&amp;nbsp;target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why do people quit their&amp;nbsp;jobs?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What is happening to the&amp;nbsp;markets?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wall Street and&amp;nbsp;politics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I subscribe to &lt;a href="https://wallstreetonparade.com/"&gt;Wall Street on Parade&lt;/a&gt;. Even though it&amp;#8217;s well-written and usually says something new, the unvarying underlying message can be depressing. That message is that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; government is now a creature of the finance industry and that the Fed and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury are run to benefit the managers of Wall Street firms. 
&lt;a href="https://wallstreetonparade.com/2021/08/meet-the-two-congressmen-who-facilitated-todays-derivatives-nightmare-at-wall-streets-mega-banks/"&gt;Today&amp;#8217;s edition&lt;/a&gt; is fairly typical.
It cites two examples of Congressmen who have rotated, through the revolving door, into jobs with the finance industry after having participated in sabotaging legislation which would have limited the power of large banks.
I don&amp;#8217;t know enough, or care enough, to check the details, but I never see any rebuttals of this work, and I imagine that if it contained any factual inaccuracies the individuals named would seem some sort of redress.
The Internet is a dangerous place, as it&amp;#8217;s easy to miss the arguments from the other side. 
But nobody really seems to be making those arguments, as far as I can&amp;nbsp;see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was a distinctly risk off day, in spite of the major &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; equity markets looking as though they will finish flat.
It seems that these days, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; are sort of risk-off proxies. 
Equity is no longer seen as risk capital. 
I don&amp;#8217;t know why, but the Twitter consensus is that the Plunge Protection Team of Yellen and Powell can always be counted on to ride to the rescue of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; equity markets if they should show signs of having more than a couple of down days on the&amp;nbsp;run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main casualty of the risk off sentiment was commodities. 
Essentially every commodity that is traded was down, from energy to food to precious metals.
The sole exception was Natural Gas, which was up 40bps.
Most of the energy complex was down by ~2%, after a run of six down days. Crude is now at $64 a barrel.
The dollar was a beneficiary of this risk off mood, hitting 93.5, above where it peaked at the end of March, and not far off where it was last&amp;nbsp;Nov.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main economic news was &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; new unemployment claims were down at 348K, about 15K fewer than expected. I would have thought this would be positive, but it may make the hinted-at Fed tapering more likely. The Delta variant is still with us, and there are lots of cases, but by any objective measure not many people are&amp;nbsp;dying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds were not very active today, 10Y yields down just a couple of bp. I&amp;#8217;ve always accepted that the bond guys may be the most miserable traders on Wall Street, but they are also the most well-informed. One bond guy who certainly qualifies is &lt;a href="https://alhambrapartners.com/author/jsnider/"&gt;Jeff Snider of Alhambra Investments&lt;/a&gt;.
He writes extensively about the shadow money system, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TIC&lt;/span&gt; (Treasury Internation Capital System) and what these repo madness episodes really mean.
He thinks the world is going to hell in a handcart, which would be miserable but is music to the ears of bond&amp;nbsp;investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My bias is to think that bond yields cannot go much lower. They are already deeply negative, at least in real terms, and for most of Europe and Japan they are negative in real terms.
The simple-minded me who thinks that &lt;a href="https://richardduncaneconomics.com/the-world-is-300-trillion-in-debt/"&gt;global debt hitting &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; 300 trillion&lt;/a&gt; is hard to square with a shrinking money supply which would lead to deflation.
But guys like Snider and Lacy Hunt have been right more often than they&amp;#8217;ve been wrong, so maybe I am just missing something.
There is certainly a risk that a collapse of demand will cut inflation, which will then push up real rates to the point where they form a self-reinforcing deflationary&amp;nbsp;spiral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, the new version of &lt;a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;#8217;ve installed can&amp;#8217;t find any of my (stolen)&amp;nbsp;images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve moved to &lt;a href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-pkgs.html"&gt;Anaconda&lt;/a&gt; to install Python packages. It seems to be an improvement on Pip and virtual environments, but for some reason it doesn&amp;#8217;t want to install the latest version of Pelican (4.6.0) and instead installs 3.7.0, which doesn&amp;#8217;t support the &lt;code&gt;{attach}&lt;/code&gt; syntax that I have used&amp;nbsp;throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There must be a way of fixing this, but for the time being my images are all borked, but at least I know why, at least in&amp;nbsp;principle.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Afghan War Lumbers on</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/afghan-war-lumbers-on.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-08-18T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:48+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-08-18:/afghan-war-lumbers-on.html</id><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;18 Aug&amp;nbsp;21&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As some wag pointed out, Twitter is full of Covid experts who double up as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; foreign policy experts.
I would never claim to be an expert, but I&amp;#8217;ve never heard anyone sensible and disinterested arguing that the Afghan army ever had a chance against …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;17 Aug&amp;nbsp;2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As some wag pointed out, Twitter is full of Covid experts who double up as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; foreign policy experts.
I would never claim to be an expert, but I&amp;#8217;ve never heard anyone sensible and disinterested arguing that the Afghan army ever had a chance against the Taliban.
For a start, they are much more vulnerable than the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; troops in that their families are living in the damn country.
The other thing is that, as I understand it, the corrupt officials in the old regime would steal the money that was supposed to be used to pay them to boost their Swiss Bank account&amp;nbsp;balances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem is the huge conflict of interest between ordinary citizens and the defence industry. Eisenhower saw it coming, in his valedictory speech as president in&amp;nbsp;1961:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the latest of our world conflicts, the United States had no armaments industry. American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense; we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. Added to this, three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment. We annually spend on military security more than the net income of all United States&amp;nbsp;corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence &amp;#8212; economic, political, even spiritual &amp;#8212; is felt in every city, every State house, every office of the Federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our&amp;nbsp;society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will&amp;nbsp;persist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper&amp;nbsp;together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPAC&lt;/span&gt; sponsors are not your&amp;nbsp;friends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://yetanothervalueblog.substack.com/p/spac-sponsors-dont-give-a-fudge-about"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is a fantastic piece about why the incentives faced by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPAC&lt;/span&gt; sponsors are very unaligned with those of the ordinary&amp;nbsp;investor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A whole range of SPACs have collapsed, since about the 8th August. 
My guess is that they&amp;#8217;ll mainly be like the bubble stocks from 2000, i.e. burnt-out shells within the year. 
However, some might have a solid business model and be the Amazon of the 2050s. 
Those who have a powerful magnet might like to tackle this job like they&amp;#8217;d tackle finding a needle in a haystack.
Others would probably be better advised to do something less&amp;nbsp;risky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why is the construction sector so resistant to&amp;nbsp;innovation?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://constructionphysics.substack.com/p/why-its-hard-to-innovate-in-construction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no one single reason, but a big problem is the structure of the industry, with many layers of subcontractors, which leads to a breakdown of incentives. 
The best way to avoid things going wrong is to avoid any untried techniques.
Contractors, who need to be persuaded of the benefit of new materials, do not capture any of the upside in using them. 
Very often the architect specifies traditional materials and techniques, because this makes it easier for him to run the competition.
He has no incentive to recommend anything newfangled, especially as his fees are usually a percentage of the total&amp;nbsp;cost.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Aluminium glitters brighter than gold</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/aluminium-glitters-brighter-than-gold.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-08-15T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:48+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-08-15:/aluminium-glitters-brighter-than-gold.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Weekend 14/15&amp;nbsp;August&lt;/h1&gt;

The stimulus is yesterday&amp;#8217;s news.
Stock markets globally hit more all time highs.
I assume this is all tied up to the confidence collapse pushing out the expected start of tapering.
It still seems odd when bad news for the economy is brilliant news for the stock market,
but investors have developed a Pavlovian response to anything which might keep the Fed from tightening.
Oil and natural gas were weaker. It&amp;#8217;s very rare to see the two move in tandem.
Apart from gold, which has a good recent run, most commodities were up, 
presumably helped by a weaker dollar.
Oats are at their highest price for seven&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European equities seem to have finally escaped the doldrums. Even the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTSE100&lt;/span&gt; was&amp;nbsp;positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main international news at the moment is the implosion in Afghanistan following the withdrawal of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; (and Brit) troops. 
I am no international strategist, but it seems obvious to me that once the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; left, we&amp;#8217;d see a re-run of the fall of Saigon.
So much money, maybe $2T, spent. I hope the shareholders of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; defence contractors were suitably grateful to the policians in charge of these&amp;nbsp;policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; inflation (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPI&lt;/span&gt; measure) was 5.4% annualized in July, a rate unchanged from the previous month and fractionally above&amp;nbsp;expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Senate passed a $1T (i.e. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;1MMM&lt;/span&gt;) infrastructure bill, with cross party support. 
A federal budget framework of $3.5T was also agreed by the Senate (very narrowly,&amp;nbsp;50-49).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deficit of $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;302MMM&lt;/span&gt; was notched up in July. At that rate, that&amp;#8217;s a deficit of $3.6T: a lot of money.
A trillion here, a trillion there, and pretty soon we&amp;#8217;re talking real money.
Stocks went up, more all time highs.
The dollar dropped to 93 (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt;), but it&amp;#8217;s still very high.
Treasuries were unbothered.
Nothing matters, until everything matters. 
The sentiment of the market is that everything will turn out &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;.
Maybe that&amp;#8217;s correct.
The market is probably an unbiased&amp;nbsp;indicator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; Housing&amp;nbsp;market&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are problematic institutions.
They transform illiquid risky assets into money, which is liquid and risk free.
But they can only do this by assigning all the risk to the government.
Ultimately, governments cannot afford, politically, to see bank deposits vaporized.
So all the incentives for bankers to balance risk and reward, at least as far as risk to depositors is concerned, is removed.
To compensate for this, banks are subject to mind-bogglingly complex regulation to prevent them taking too much risk.
The result of this is that banks compete with each other by being better at finding loopholes in the regulation.
Every so often there is a crash, taxpayers bail out the banks, and another set of loopholes is plugged, but only at the cost of making bank regulation even more complex and&amp;nbsp;gameable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because housing and land constitutes by far the biggest asset on banks&amp;#8217; balance sheets, the side effect of this policy is to make housing a one-way bet for investors, but an unaffordable luxury for those who want to actually consume housing&amp;nbsp;services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a mess. It&amp;#8217;s becoming a consensus on the left that it&amp;#8217;s a sort of conspiracy to enrich the rentier class. 
I don&amp;#8217;t actually think this narrative is true. It&amp;#8217;s more likely that some reasonable-sounding policies to improve the stability of the financial system had unforeseen consequences. 
But, whatever the origin of the problem, it has become a very serious one and has created a formidable intersection of interest groups which see radical reform as likely to do them serious economic&amp;nbsp;harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tyranny of&amp;nbsp;merit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just listened to Luigi Zingales and Bethany McLean interview Michael Sandel about his latest book.
For a review, look &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/06/michael-sandel-the-populist-backlash-has-been-a-revolt-against-the-tyranny-of-merit"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandel argues that we all rationalize unjustified rewards. It&amp;#8217;s hard to believe we passed an exam because we were lucky with our choice of&amp;nbsp;parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He argues that Blair &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Clinton &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Obama had a rhetoric of meritocracy, which resulted in their parties being abandoned by the very voters those parties were established to&amp;nbsp;represent.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The willingness of the Democrats to become the party of producer interest and concentrated power is the story of the last few decades. It was played out not only in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; but in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; and Western Europe too.
It has lead to the rise of demagoguery exemplified by Trump, Farage, Orban and le Pen (senior and&amp;nbsp;junior).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He argues that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GFC&lt;/span&gt; showed that the highly rewarded leaders of the finance industry were actually not very good at their job.
Insanely, Jamie Dimon is now a multi-billionaire for vaporizing the equity of the bank where he was the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also points out that it is difficult to separate out monetary reward from respect. This is true in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;, but maybe elsewhere.
The heavier taxation of income from labour than income from capital shows the balance of priorities.
The ludicrous &amp;#8220;carried interest exemption&amp;#8221; shows where power lies in modern&amp;nbsp;society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few other&amp;nbsp;thoughts: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meritocracy does not recognize the contribution of others to the success of&amp;nbsp;leaders. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economic price is a measure of scarcity relative to demand.  To a large extent, this is a measure of luck. The ability to master contour integration or matrix algebra would not have resulted in any special status in almost every human society that has ever existed, until&amp;nbsp;today&amp;#8217;s. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fewer and fewer class mixing institutions exist. The elite now travel in private jets and yachts, and no longer take the bus, as Harold Wilson undoubtedly&amp;nbsp;did.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is an increasing separation of communities. America, and probably many other countries, are much more segregated by wealth than they ever were in the&amp;nbsp;past.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equality of opportunity is a slippery concept. This is something that the elite struggle to comprehend, but the down and out has no problem&amp;nbsp;with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A challenge for any meritocracy is a question of measurement. Almost always a proxy is used. A meritorious trader is one who made the biggest profits. But there is no assurance that this is a good measure of actual&amp;nbsp;talent.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Inflation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems fairly obvious that if the currency is rebased, inflation will occur.

If the govt. announces that each pound in your bank account will be multiplied by ten overnight, the price of everything will rocket.
Well, not everything. 
Your mortgage will suddenly have got a lot cheaper, unless your liability accounts are redenominated.
But, one way or another, inflation will result.
Central banks are creating money, or, at least, doing their level best to make commercial banks lend, and thereby create money.
This has not been felt in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPI&lt;/span&gt;, much, except in that base effects more or less guarantee that stats will look bad for a couple of months,
given that a year ago we were locked down&amp;nbsp;hard.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Reflation trade dead?

But the trend seems embedded: commodities down, dollar up, yields down, curves flattening, inflation transitory, rates heading to zero (real rates -2%). Equity markets lack direction.
The accepted cause seems to be the dreaded Delta Variant.
Australia and China have had waves of the variant, and so everyone now doubts whether the world will ever get back to &amp;#8216;normal&amp;#8217;.
I feel that we are near the end of the tunnel.
Estimates for deaths from Covid seem to be between 4 million and 8 million. 
This is a lot, but it&amp;#8217;s still only about one in a thousand, and overwhelmingly it kills those who are already very ill or very old.
I would not dream of saying that authorities over reacted. 
The level of the threat was sufficient to justify a lot of the actions taken.
But now we understand a lot about the disease and most people can take effective steps to avoid catching it, if they wish&amp;nbsp;to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of these, OppFi looks to be on a flightpath to oblivion, from a technical perspective.
The others look too perky to short, in my opinion. 
&lt;em&gt;Not investment&amp;nbsp;advice!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gold&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold is untradeable, to me. 
It hasn&amp;#8217;t had a clear direction for a long time.
The creation of so much money supply would seem to guarantee that it&amp;#8217;s price would rise almost monotonically.
But that&amp;#8217;s almost the opposite of what has&amp;nbsp;happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have pondered on the cause of this, but haven&amp;#8217;t come up with anything very compelling.
Gold isn&amp;#8217;t very trendy. Wearing a chain an a medallion, both made of gold, seems sooo 1980s. 
Maybe all the gold bugs have pivoted to bitcoin.
Maybe they are all in meme stocks.
Maybe they all the &amp;#8216;transitory&amp;#8217; thesis and have decided that negative real interest rates are a passing phase, and that the future holds the promise of money-like assets giving a decent real yield.
But I hadn&amp;#8217;t seriously considered the possibility that it was all an evil conspiracy by Wall Street.
Well, someone thinks that it is: &lt;a href="https://kingworldnews.com/the-gold-markets-why-me-moment-and-the-dark-side-of-manipulation/"&gt;King Gold thinks that the weakness in the price of physical gold is a cunning plan to allow banks to cheaply source the stuff to meet their yet-to-be imposed obligations under Basel 3.&lt;/a&gt;
Is this plausible? I very much doubt it, but something pretty odd is going on, so I wouldn&amp;#8217;t rule it out&amp;nbsp;totally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various permabears, such as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NorthmanTrader"&gt;Sven Henrich&lt;/a&gt;, have been talking about how the Fed is destroying price discovery for equities by endlessly monetizing debt. 
But he never talks about why some assets ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMZN&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FB&lt;/span&gt;, real estate) are so responsive, but gold resolutely refuses to play ball.
Maybe I have misjudged him. He tweets endlessly and I probably miss 99% of them.
But it still seems odd how unequally the asset-price inflating impact of the Fed has been.
Gold seems an obvious beneficiary, as it is the traditional anchor of&amp;nbsp;value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;David&amp;nbsp;Cameron&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rolling train wreck that is Greensill plus Gupta Family Group is doing more and more damage to the reputation of David Cameron. The latest revelations is that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt; was able to sell approx $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;10MM&lt;/span&gt; of his Greensill shares before the group became insolvent. The fact that Greensill was backstopped on eight loans to Gupta when it should have been limited to one, after &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt; had sent 56 text messages to Treasury officials trying to get them to approve them look terrible to the average voter, however technically correct the decision was.
The damage to Cameron&amp;#8217;s reputation will have a secondary effect on the reputation of the Conservative Party. 
The party has been in power, exclusively or in coalition, since 2010. By the time of the next election, it will be forteen years. 
Very few &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; parties manage to remain in power for&amp;nbsp;longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-58149765"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt; report on the affair&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s obsession over being unbiased usually leads them to avoid this sort of coverage. Maybe they sense that Cameron is a spent&amp;nbsp;force.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Intuitive understanding</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/intuitive-understanding.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-08-09T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:47+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-08-09:/intuitive-understanding.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;9th&amp;nbsp;Aug&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was quite young, I must have seen some sort of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; interview of Hermann Bondi, then the master of a Cambridge college.
He said something which resonated with me, which is that in some sense we have an instinctive grasp of Newtonian mechanics.
A dog can catch a ball thrown to it, even though it has never seen the equation of a parabola. 
Maybe this is what is meant.
Anyway, it&amp;#8217;s an old trope of economics that ordinary people have no intuitive grasp of it.
Politicians from Alec Douglas-Home to Margaret Thatcher have been mocked for saying things that betrayed a misunderstanding of modern (probably implicitly Keynsian) ideas of how the economy as a whole&amp;nbsp;works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I am not really persuaded that our instincts lead us astray so badly in macroeconomics. 
I think that we do understand that our consumption is someone else&amp;#8217;s income. 
Keynes wrote about &amp;#8220;the paradox of thrift&amp;#8221; which is just another version of the fallacy of composition: if we all stop spending, in order to save more, it won&amp;#8217;t work because our lack of spending will result in everyone not having an income.
This strictly works in a closed economy, obviously, because if we could get foreigners to take all our output, we&amp;#8217;d be fine (except that we&amp;#8217;d end up having our savings in foreign&amp;nbsp;assets).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bondi actually wrote a book, &amp;#8220;Relativity and Common Sense: A New Approach to Einstein,&amp;#8221; which attempted to make Special Relativity intuitively plausible. 
It&amp;#8217;s interesting that he, as a mathematical prodigy, chose to do this without&amp;nbsp;equations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;

The groups, which have not so far been allowed to default, have about 48.7trn yuan ($7.5trn) in debts, 11.9trn yuan of which is held in fixed-income&amp;nbsp;securities.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Archegos staff may face $500m loss after pay plan&amp;nbsp;collapses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees of Archegos Capital Management face losses of about $500m after the value of a deferred pay plan set up by the firm crashed along with its other&amp;nbsp;investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family office run by Bill Hwang is yet to release money it owes to former staff, who saw the value of their deferred bonuses soar to about $500m before Archegos collapsed in March, according to two people close to the&amp;nbsp;firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archegos sent shockwaves through financial markets when it was forced to unwind several highly leveraged trades made using derivatives known as total return swaps. The episode left the banks with which it traded, including Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley and Nomura, nursing losses of more than&amp;nbsp;$10bn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;. The idea that a &amp;#8220;family office&amp;#8221; has a staff bill running into hundreds of millions is a&amp;nbsp;joke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Grid storage battery&amp;nbsp;fire&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fire at one of the largest Tesla battery installations has drawn fresh attention to the risks of batteries used to store renewable energy for electricity&amp;nbsp;grids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took three days for the blaze to be extinguished after it started during testing in a shipping container holding a 13 tonne lithium-ion battery, at Moorabool near Geelong in Australia, and spread to a second battery&amp;nbsp;pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Victorian Big Battery project using the Tesla Megapack is the largest in the country, with 210 packs capable of storing up to 450 megawatt-hours of energy for the electricity&amp;nbsp;grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rules of the&amp;nbsp;game&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading is not investing. &lt;a href="https://themacrocompass.substack.com/p/5-rules-to-not-suck-at-this-game"&gt;This handy summary&lt;/a&gt; tells you what you should do if you want to make it as a&amp;nbsp;trader:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be realistic about your goals: recognize that if you take big risks, you must pay a bigger&amp;nbsp;carry,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;try to have an asymmetric payoff: make your bad bets lose less than your good bets win. This is easy to say, but hard to do. Buying options gives you an asymmetric profile, but of course you pay for the&amp;nbsp;hedging,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use stops, maybe trailing stops. Works much better in a trending market than the noisy market we are in&amp;nbsp;now,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don&amp;#8217;t use up all you margin on one position (and don&amp;#8217;t assume that margin use is an accurate measure of&amp;nbsp;risk),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;understand that &amp;#8220;the only perfect hedge is in a Japanese garden,&amp;#8221; or, in other words, don&amp;#8217;t imagine that correlations won&amp;#8217;t go to one (or minus one) in a panic, thereby rendering your hedges&amp;nbsp;worthless,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;kill your babies&amp;#8221; (i.e. avoid becoming emotionally invested in any&amp;nbsp;position),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do not trade on a macro thesis until the market has woken up to the idea (or, in the immortal words of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JMK&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Japan and balance&amp;nbsp;sheets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was about to buy Richard Koo&amp;#8217;s book &amp;#8220;The Holy Grail of Macroeconomics&amp;#8221; but it&amp;#8217;s quite expensive in money and time, so I thought I&amp;#8217;d at least try to find an outline of the thesis. 
I managed to find &lt;a href="http://www.enlightenmenteconomics.com/blog/index.php/2010/02/the-holy-grail-of-macroeconomics-a-guest-review/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; by Diane Coyle. 
My summary of this&amp;nbsp;is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Japan experienced a Hiroshima like explosion in asset prices, followed by an implosion which is unprecedented in global economic history: real estate fell 87% in&amp;nbsp;price!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The resulting pressure on companies to repair their balance sheets, caused dysfunctional debt-reducing behaviour, at the expense of producing profits for&amp;nbsp;shareholders,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the contraction in aggregate demand created the deflation that has plagued Japan for the last thirty&amp;nbsp;years,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the drive to save created a classic &amp;#8216;Paradox of Thrift&amp;#8217; where everyone tries to spend but simply reduces his neighbour&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;income,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the govt. undertook a massive public spending programme, to take  up some of the slack in the economy resulting from the savings&amp;nbsp;binge,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;huge govt. insurance schemes for banks allowed depositors to ignore the fact they were lending to insolvent&amp;nbsp;institutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may read the book, but at least I now understand the outline of the theory. 
Central banks have blown huge bubbles in some asset classes, with very bad consequences for wealth inequality, but at least I can understand why the policy was adopted. 
(I still believe that wiping out equity holders, and some debt holders would still have been preferable in&amp;nbsp;2008/9.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>What we have here is a failure to trust</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/what-we-have-here-is-a-failure-to-trust.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-08-04T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:47+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-08-04:/what-we-have-here-is-a-failure-to-trust.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;4&amp;nbsp;August&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While 3 month realized vols have trended small lower/threaded water, the 3 month implied vols have continued&amp;nbsp;higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you think there is something big occurring this month, vols and especially the short term &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; looks&amp;nbsp;rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you play&amp;nbsp;this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given how far we have come and the fact there is some uncertainty going forward we would look at earning some &amp;#8220;extra summer yield&amp;#8221; for the people that want to stay long. Why not overwriting some of your favorite longs; covered calls for&amp;nbsp;example?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need portfolio hedges you should &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; look at long short term &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; exposure, it is simply too rich. Skew remains steep, so put spreads still make sense as an overall portfolio&amp;nbsp;hedge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think this slow grind higher at highs goes on for longer, a simple sold straddle/strangle also makes sense given how elevated vols&amp;nbsp;trade.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Oil market becalmed</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/oil-market-becalmed.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-08-03T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:47+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-08-03:/oil-market-becalmed.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;3 Aug&amp;nbsp;2021&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Manipulating the political&amp;nbsp;agenda&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media is full of stuff about trans-gender athletes.
There is a huge amount of coverage of green issues.
Feminism, especially the sort that says women are people who are born with a vagina, is now very controversial.
Islamophobia, antisemitism, racism, mental health are all major issues for the left.
But nobody talks about economic policy issues any longer: redistribution, wealth taxes, carried interest exemption, capital transfer taxes, estate taxes, bankruptcy of banks, enforcement of tax collection, competition policy, eminent domain etc.&amp;nbsp;etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s almost as if the 0.01% control the policy&amp;nbsp;agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post was influenced by the fact that I have just finished  &amp;#8216;Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few&amp;#8217; by Robert Reich. 
I plan to write a review of it on GoodReads.
In many ways it echos themes in [Saving Capitalism from the Capitalists].(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving_Capitalism_from_the_Capitalists)
The core point is that the world is moving further and further away from the capitalism of (Adam) Smith, Stanley Jevons, Alfred Marshall and Milton Friedman, as the elites learn to undermine the role of the state as an umpire in the game of commercial&amp;nbsp;competition.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>New Paradigm</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/new-paradigm.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-07-28T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:52+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-07-28:/new-paradigm.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;28 July&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8216;21&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Inflation&amp;nbsp;expectations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a lot of people, I tend to think of the bond guys as the ones who understand what is going on in the economy.
Bond yields are being crushed, which implies that the bond buys think that the central banks are correct in asserting that inflation is merely transitory.
But this makes no sense. The marginal buyer of govt. bonds (off whose yields the rest of the bond market trades) is those very central banks. 
It&amp;#8217;s almost like Elon Musk predicting that Tesla&amp;#8217;s deliveries will break records this quarter and then going out an buying a ton of&amp;nbsp;calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money supply (M3) growth in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; is running at 8.2% annually. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; is higher (13%?). If this doesn&amp;#8217;t lead to inflation, monetarism is dead. The bulk of the contribution to the increase is loans to governments. It is just about possible they will spend this on capital projects, but it&amp;#8217;s much more likely they will use it for transfer payments, I&amp;nbsp;feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;diverge&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wrap for 27&amp;nbsp;July&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks took a dip ahead of tomorrow’s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOMC&lt;/span&gt; rate decision, as the S&amp;amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 pulled back by 50 and 110 basis points, respectively, though each finished well off their worst levels of the day following an overnight liquidation in Chinese equities.  Treasurys caught a bid with the long bond yield sinking to just 1.89%, while &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTI&lt;/span&gt; crude remained near $72 a barrel and gold finished near $1,800 for a fifth straight session.  The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; advanced to 19.4, up 10% on the day.&amp;nbsp;|&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general tenor of the market seems to be risk on, except for Chinese internet stocks ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KWEB&lt;/span&gt;) which has infected various Far East markets.
There is an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOMC&lt;/span&gt; announcement tomorrow, which will undoubtedly be dovish to some extent, but if it is less than extremely dovish this time it could well spook&amp;nbsp;equities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10Y is now down to&amp;nbsp;1.23%. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Summer&amp;nbsp;serenity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The markets seem eerily calm at the moment. No new themes seem to have emerged for ages.
To me, we seem to be living on borrowed time. 
We&amp;#8217;re either getting inflation, or a crash.
Nobody seems to like what the Fed is doing (maybe Larry Fink or Ken Griffin are an exceptions). 
One good example of this is &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8ed6a9a5-914c-4c15-89f3-fe7f2395dea3"&gt;this op-ed by Brendan Greeley&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The Fed] takes some of the $5.2tn in Treasuries it holds on its balance sheet, transfers ownership of some of them to money market funds and commercial banks, then credits itself with cash, in the same amount. The next day, the Fed reverses the transaction: it buys the Treasuries back. But this time the Fed loses a little money. It buys high, then sells low. On&amp;nbsp;purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things I noticed from &lt;a href="https://dailyshotbrief.com/the-daily-shot-brief-july-20th-2021/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Daily Shot&lt;/em&gt; today&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; residents are no longer comfortable with buying, and more importantly, financing a house today (U&amp;nbsp;Michigan), &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, housing demand is still strong (reluctant buyers with no alternatives and Blackrock,&amp;nbsp;presumably),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greensill Bank seems still to rank in the top ten &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8216;unicorns.&amp;#8217; The list is headed by Revolut, which is ten times the value of Oxford Nanopore, which at least has some patented and valuable&amp;nbsp;technology,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Funds have been flowing into Columbia&amp;#8217;s local currency debt, while its economy takes a&amp;nbsp;dive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things I noticed in &lt;em&gt;The Market Ear&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;newsletter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GS&lt;/span&gt; are convinced that oil is heading&amp;nbsp;higher,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; is struggling to regain momentum, in spite of a general risk-on tone to the&amp;nbsp;markets,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &amp;#8216;blackout&amp;#8217; period for buybacks has ended and now is the season for CEOs of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SP500&lt;/span&gt; companies to not spare the balance sheet in pursuit of their&amp;nbsp;bonuses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Morgan Stanley Global Risk Demand Index is flashing green: it&amp;#8217;s reading -2.13, which constitutes &amp;#8216;extreme risk aversion&amp;#8217;. I have no idea how this is computed, but it tends to reverse once it gets to these levels, leading to a strong rebound in risk&amp;nbsp;appetite. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10Y yield is looking overstretched on the downside. At about 1.1%, it&amp;#8217;s discounting something approaching deflation in the next ten years, which no serious macro forecaster is (&lt;em&gt;pace&lt;/em&gt; Lacey Hunt). This has caused a real flattening in the&amp;nbsp;curve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breakevens, which go as the yield on Treasury bills less the yield on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TIPS&lt;/span&gt;, have been falling. 
Presumably, this reflects two parts of the bond market not agreeing about the&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The falling yields have hammered &amp;#8216;short duration&amp;#8217; stocks like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XOM&lt;/span&gt;, relative to long duration stocks, such as&amp;nbsp;Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, this was a bounce back from Monday&amp;#8217;s swoon. 
Not based on any particular news, as far as I can tell.
Most markets bouncing back, especially oil and related commodities.
As far as I can tell, the volatility is all driven by nervousness about Covid variants. Well, maybe not so much the variants as the (over)reaction we can expect from nervous&amp;nbsp;governments.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Freedom Day comes and goes</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/freedom-day-comes-and-goes.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-07-19T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:52+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-07-19:/freedom-day-comes-and-goes.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;19 July&amp;nbsp;2021&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today has been trailed for weeks as &amp;#8220;Freedom Day,&amp;#8221; when life in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; was going to return to normal.
Well, it didn&amp;#8217;t quite work out that way, as measured cases are still quite high and the badly designed &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; Covid&amp;#8221; app has wreaked havoc by &amp;#8216;pinging&amp;#8217; workers who have no symptoms, are fully vaccinated but might have come withing bluetooth range of someone who has potentially been&amp;nbsp;infected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can see, the app has been an unmitigated disaster, and has made a negligible contribution to suppressing transmission of the virus, but it&amp;#8217;s easy to see why the cabinet grasped at a shiny new piece of vapourware as the answer to all its prayers as the scale of the pandemic became apparent in the first quarter of&amp;nbsp;2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Markets&amp;nbsp;swoon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had some strong classic risk-off behaviour&amp;nbsp;today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;commodities all down, oil by&amp;nbsp;7.5%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bonds jumping, 10Y yield now&amp;nbsp;1.18%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nearly all equity markets slumping by more than&amp;nbsp;1%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPY&lt;/span&gt; dropping by &amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0.5%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin down&amp;nbsp;3.8%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s really not entirely clear what has driven this, other than sheer old age of the bull market.
Tomorrow is very hard to call. As usual, the most likely outcome is that prices rebound a bit, but it&amp;#8217;s hard to say as the down trend is getting some legs now. People are spending some of the massive rise in their net wealth, even the very rich with their famously low propensity to&amp;nbsp;spend.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Revolut is remarkable</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/revolut-is-remarkable.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-07-18T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:52+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-07-18:/revolut-is-remarkable.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Weekend 17/18 July (and week in&amp;nbsp;review)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revolut is the highest value private company in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; at £33B.
It shows all the signs of being prepared for an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IPO&lt;/span&gt;, through one of the many routes (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPAC&lt;/span&gt;, probably).
The mainstream press is carrying lots of stories about how innovative it is, and rather less about how it has never managed to make a profit, nor how it spends a fortune on referral fees to boost its user numbers, nor how it doesn&amp;#8217;t even have a banking licence in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, or how if it would have to be much better capitalized, nor how it&amp;#8217;s trading on 75 times&amp;nbsp;revenues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my best guess is that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IPO&lt;/span&gt; will be hailed as a huge success, especially by the City firms that bring it to&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cameron&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Cameron has been revealed to have been paid insane amounts of money for a very part time job as &amp;#8220;advisor&amp;#8221; to Greensill. The work seemed to consist of bombarding his former colleagues with pleas to give loans to the &amp;#8220;Gupta Family Group&amp;#8221; which could be used to let Greensill off the hook.
The full extent of the lobbying scandal is yet to emerge, but this is sleaze on an industrial scale, certainly in comparison to the so-called sleaze under John Major. That episode gave the country ten years of Blairite government. It may yet happen that Cameron&amp;#8217;s actions delivers several Labour&amp;nbsp;governments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Freedom&amp;nbsp;Day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supposedly, most Covid-19 restrictions are to be lifted on 19th July.
There are plausible arguments on both sides.
Because whatever is decided, we all have to abide by the same rules, it&amp;#8217;s not really feasible to let everyone decide for&amp;nbsp;himself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Football&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think that politicians should make a big fuss about being interested in football.
I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure most of them have been to the opera more often than they&amp;#8217;ve gone to a football match.
I know that some have a deep and abiding love for the game, but as far as most of the cabinet are concerned, I&amp;#8217;m fairly sceptical.
At least Euro 2020 is over for another three years, so we&amp;#8217;ll see less of this faux&amp;nbsp;enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Most-shorted&amp;nbsp;index&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has spent the last quarter going skywards. It has started coming down to earth, violently, recently.
Whether this has any implications for other classes of assets is anyone&amp;#8217;s guess, but surely it indicates a declining appetite for riskier assets.
The index is called &lt;em&gt;Refinitiv United States Most Shorted&lt;/em&gt; and has the snappy ticker $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TRXUSPMSHRT&lt;/span&gt;. I&amp;#8217;d share a chart, but trading view doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to cover&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Financial&amp;nbsp;Repression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/inflation-and-interest-rates-unrelated/"&gt;Alex Manzara talks about interest rates and inflation rates.&lt;/a&gt;
He points out that they can become uncorrelated if a government is determined enough.
Normally, interest rates rise in tandem with inflation rates. 
Savers want a real return, not a nominal return.
As inflation erodes their real return on a fixed rate investment, they demand a higher rate, so the rates move together.
But if a government or central bank regulates saving institutions and savers so they are obliged to keep their money in fixed income, long-dated securities, that&amp;#8217;s what they&amp;#8217;ll do.
To an extend this has happened already, but Alex suspects it&amp;#8217;s going to happen more, so that selling govt. bonds on the expectation inflation taking off may be an&amp;nbsp;error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will this happen outside of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;? I think it might. Especially in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, which is historically more prone to inflation than Germany, which sets the tone for the rest of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The argument is that we&amp;#8217;re in for a re-run of the forties, when the equity risk premium went up as inflation&amp;nbsp;spiked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am fairly convinced that Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s Disease is an auto-immune condition. I am totally convinced that it is the most economically costly disease which is facing the world right now.

The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FDA&lt;/span&gt; approve drugs based on their not being harmful, rather than on their being actually effective, which should dampen anyone&amp;#8217;s enthusiasm.
A lot of other biotech firms are working along the same lines as INmune, it&amp;nbsp;seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with biotech is that you have to spend a decade studying molecular biology at university to have a hope of understanding what they are doing, let alone decide if it is going to work, and (even more importantly) lead to a treatment that is superior to their competitors. Even with lots of data, the future performance radically&amp;nbsp;uncertain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing in INmune Bio therefore is more like buying an out-of-the-money option. But with such radical uncertainty around this field, it may well that this option is under&amp;nbsp;priced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Job shortages in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://think.ing.com/articles/the-desperate-hunt-for-us-workers-continues"&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; has more jobs than workers.&lt;/a&gt;
This is a good thing, for labour. 
Maybe not such a good thing for capital.
I cannot see how this will not give rise to inflation.
It feels like the late 1940s, &amp;#8216;50s, where National Service and the slow release of labour from the conscripted army kept wages high and inflation up. 
Just as then, the government had borrowed far too much, such that the lenders (largely &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; savers) would have to take the pain.
Now it is the Bank of England, but in reality that&amp;#8217;s just us anyway, so the pain will be more evenly spread.
Of course, the pensioners will not be spared, but that&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, they have had a good&amp;nbsp;run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not an original idea. The Economist has been pointing it out for a long time. &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/07/04/central-banks-face-up-to-the-daunting-task-of-quitting-qe"&gt;Here is another article on the same&amp;nbsp;topic.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chinese Internet stocks getting&amp;nbsp;hammered&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With what has happened to Jack Ma, plus Didi getting pulled from the Chinese app store, it&amp;#8217;s not suprising that $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KWEB&lt;/span&gt; is being hammered. Down 44% from its &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATH&lt;/span&gt; in Feb this year, it has further to go, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMHO&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img alt="Inflation is now rising,pushing all real yields down" src="https://compoundadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/real-yields-7-11.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How long this can go on is anyone&amp;#8217;s guess. But it can&amp;#8217;t go on&amp;nbsp;forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Now people are flying again, airline stocks finally start on a descent&amp;nbsp;path&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t had time to write daily &amp;#8216;wraps&amp;#8217; recently.
The opening up of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; economy has had a personal impact on me.
I have needed to spend my time working on other things.
I will therefore try to make sense of market behaviour over a slightly longer period than one&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current driver seems to be the resurgence of Covid, particularly the &amp;#8216;delta&amp;#8217; variant. 
It was always likely that Covid would evolve to form a more transmissible strain. 
This was always the worry with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt; which, if it were as contagious as Covid would have practically wiped out the planet by&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Commodities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only asset which has not seen strong price action since 2008 is commodities. 
I don&amp;#8217;t know whether this means that they are cheap, and even if I did know that they are cheap there is no reason why they should not become even&amp;nbsp;cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, the oil price has recovered from its swoon on Tuesday.
Most commodities have benefited, but particularly hydrocarbons.
There seems to be an expectation that the supply of oil will ease, as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OPEC&lt;/span&gt;+ struggles to impose strict quotas on producers. 
Demand will undoubtedly rise, so if it is not met by an increasing supply will drive prices&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UAE&lt;/span&gt; and Saudi Arabia were reported to have failed to agree and this failure was deemed to have led to the cancellation of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OPEC&lt;/span&gt; meeting.
This should result in more production and falling prices, but this sort of reasoning is usually&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bonds &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Credit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds have been very strong since about 20 June.  In fact, bond prices have been rising (yields dropping) since about July 2020. 
This is presumably because of some slowing narrative. 
Certainly, the global economy hasn&amp;#8217;t exactly felt strong during the pandemic. 
This has now turned around, with the surprising result that $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WFC&lt;/span&gt; has strongly tightened personal credit availability. Credit card borrowing has shot up recently, presumably as shoppers and diners use their cards in shops and&amp;nbsp;restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Crypto and&amp;nbsp;currency&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday was a risk-on day, so of course &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; rallied. 
It seems to be stalled in a range between $36K and $30K. 
I guess this means that sentiment is fairly stable, although I suspect that there is a lot of transfer of assets to bagholders. Time will&amp;nbsp;tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most currencies seem to have lacked direction. With all governments trying to pull their economies out of a pandemic-induced recession using very loose monetary policy, maybe that&amp;#8217;s to be&amp;nbsp;expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Equities &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Vol&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; really hasn&amp;#8217;t managed to get off the mat for the last three months.
After a spike earlier in the week, it has crashed back down to&amp;nbsp;16.3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all consistent with punters &amp;#8220;buying the dip.&amp;#8221; I think that we&amp;#8217;re stuck in this territory until we get inflation persistently exceeding targets for an extended period. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt; have started targetting 2%, and dropped the &amp;#8220;or below&amp;#8221; language. 
I have a horrible feeling that they will get what they wish for and will regret&amp;nbsp;it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Private&amp;nbsp;Equity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private Equity is having a banner year. 
With real interest rates held down at deeply negative rates, it&amp;#8217;s not surprising that old, boring cash-generative businesses like supermarkets are being snapped up, to be replaced by SPACs which will buy unicorns with free cash flow negative for the next few decades.
Some people will become very rich from these SPACs. Principally, the sponsors, but probably some of the early investors with good&amp;nbsp;timing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; causes customers&amp;#8217; bank balances to&amp;nbsp;swell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="H/T The DailyShot" src="https://thedailyshot.com/wp-content/uploads/CR-QE-mechanics2107060433.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diagram argues that if securities are purchased from banks&amp;#8217; customers, the customers will end up with more cash in their&amp;nbsp;accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Residential&amp;nbsp;Rents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for rental properties seems very strong. Resi REITs in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; are booming. &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/1723581-hoya-capital-real-estate/5612048-staggering-rent-growth-yields-retreat-china-crackdown?mail_subject=hoya-capital-real-estate-staggering-rent-growth-yields-retreat-china-crackdown"&gt;Apartment rents in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; have seen rents jump 9.2%&lt;/a&gt;. I have never known rental growth of this magnitude. Generally, cash rents are very stable, with gross rental yields lagging capital prices by several years. The yield compression since the 90&amp;#8217;s has been agonizing in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Troops withdraw from&amp;nbsp;Afghanistan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No wonder it&amp;#8217;s called the graveyard of empires. 
&lt;a href="https://on.rt.com/bbsx"&gt;Russia resists gloating.&lt;/a&gt; 
I cannot imagine that Russia wasted the real equivalent of well over two trillion dollars in fighting an unwinnable war. 
At least a lot of defence contractors got&amp;nbsp;rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trump maybe paranoid, but they are out to get&amp;nbsp;him&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/threadreaderapp/status/1413175984241664010?s=20"&gt;This thread explains why so many people voted for Trump.&lt;/a&gt;
It&amp;#8217;s that it&amp;#8217;s rather too obvious that the establishment were out to get him, even at the cost of cutting a few corners.
I am not saying that the assertions in the thread are true, just that they constitute, in aggregate, quite a weight of&amp;nbsp;evidence.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>ISM survey sparks risk-off swoon</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/ism-survey-sparks-risk-off-swoon.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-07-06T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:52+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-07-06:/ism-survey-sparks-risk-off-swoon.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;6&amp;nbsp;July&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The markets got totally spooked by a range of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISM&lt;/span&gt; reports today.
The services index came in very weak, compared to recent months, which I would have though would have been expected. Labour costs were expected to rise, suggesting that labour shortages were the problem.

&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The markets got totally spooked by a range of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISM&lt;/span&gt; reports today.
The services index came in very weak, compared to recent months, which I would have though would have been expected. Labour costs were expected to rise, suggesting that labour shortages were the problem. 
For me, this points to inflation, but the &amp;#8216;weaker growth&amp;#8217; narrative dominated and yields fell further across the board. 
The weighted &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISM&lt;/span&gt; survey for manufacturing and services fell from a recent high of 14% to 5%. 
Presumably the weighting is by contribution to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; in which case these figures will be mainly services activity. I these are &amp;#8220;diffusion indexes,&amp;#8221; which are based on asking purchasing managers on their expectations of future economic activity. 
I don&amp;#8217;t suppose these individuals have a crystal ball that is clearer than anyone&amp;nbsp;else&amp;#8217;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the market seems to have taken the figures to heart and pivoted in the predictable deflationary direction. Nearly all equity indexes down, commodities down quite heavily, bond yields down, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; up. 
Exceptions are that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; was up a bit and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; eked out a gain, presumably in response to the idea that it&amp;#8217;s a long-duration&amp;nbsp;asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why is Japan like it&amp;nbsp;is?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&amp;#8217;s working-age population has been declining for decades. 
This will reduce demand, a bit. But a lot of those retirees are still consuming stuff.
Meanwhile, the labour supply is drying up.
Assuming the magnitude of the first effect is less than that of the second, surely this would result in increasing wage costs and inflation.
Obviously, I&amp;#8217;m missing something, but&amp;nbsp;what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something is pretty odd about China. Didi, which just IPOed in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NY&lt;/span&gt;, suddenly got removed from the app store. I think this means that new drivers can&amp;#8217;t sign up. But what it really means is that the Emperor Xi will not tolerate dissent.
How anyone can invest in equities in China is beyond me. 
I can see the appeal of sovereign local currency bonds, as it&amp;#8217;s unlikely to default and current interest rates are bound to go down. 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, maybe they&amp;#8217;ll go up for a while, but China has had its industrial revolution and is now following Japan down the path to deflationary despondency.  Well, that&amp;#8217;s my view,&amp;nbsp;obviously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Didi fiasco, maybe the authorities were sending a signal &amp;#8220;List in China, or else feel the effect of our wrath!&amp;#8221; The stock is down 30% within days, and other China &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; issues are in&amp;nbsp;doubt.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Reverse Repo Madness predicted</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/reverse-repo-madness-predicted.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-07-05T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:52+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-07-05:/reverse-repo-madness-predicted.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Note for 5&amp;nbsp;July&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was away over the weekend and didn&amp;#8217;t look at a screen. Well, maybe my phone a bit, and I read some stuff on my Kindle, but that doesn&amp;#8217;t count. Does&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; markets were closed today.
Other equity markets were generally flat: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MXEA&lt;/span&gt; nearby future was up 3bp.
In currencies, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; continued its slow decline, to 92.2, but this is still a long way above its low point in May, which was approx. 89.6.
Commodities were generally up, consistent with dollar weakening, including gold ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GC&lt;/span&gt;), but still below $1800/oz, so well behind its highs in May.
Bonds were pretty flat outside of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;.
Everything seems to have changed direction on or around 10 June, when J Powell gave his &amp;#8220;We’re Not Even Thinking About Thinking About Raising Rates&amp;#8221; speech. 
This will probably seen as a &amp;#8220;We will do whatever it takes&amp;#8221; moment.
I assume the market thinks that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; is really going full Japanese, and that the rest of the world will have no option but to follow. 
But to be fully Japanese is to run a deficit of under 3% of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;, rather than the nearly 5% in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;.
Having said that, it&amp;#8217;s remarkable how the public sector deficits of the two countries track each&amp;nbsp;other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Deficit" src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=Fe01"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tesla&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve stopped following the $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; share price. No matter how shamelessly Mr Musk manipulates the stock price, and the price of various crypto currencies, it is clear that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEC&lt;/span&gt; and the automobile safety agency are simply not going to take any action against him.
The latest fiasco is that a new engine configuration in the Model S causes almost new cars to burst into flames. 
Until someone really famous dies in a Tesla the stock price will not be harmed. 
This fact says volumes about the transparency and regulation of securities markets in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;. 
I have no doubt that markets elsewhere are usually worse.
The same unwillingness to prosecute securities manipulation has characterized the treatment of the bulge bracket&amp;nbsp;banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nat&amp;nbsp;Gas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am long-term bullish about nat gas. I believe that the world simply cannot keep running without a base level of fossil fuels, for electricity generation, plastic feedstock, fertilizer energy and possibly hydrogen production. 
&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/judeclemente/2021/07/01/as-us-temperatures-spike-so-does-the-need-for-natural-gas/?sh=44c231b92b6b"&gt;This article makes the case.&lt;/a&gt;
The economics of this have not changed for a decade. 
Even if we do manage to make carbon capture and storage economic (a big &amp;#8220;if&amp;#8221;), we will probably use it in conjunction with nat gas because that produces the least &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CO&lt;/span&gt;~2~ per&amp;nbsp;Joule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IPOs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is fixated on SPACs, but firms to come to market in the old fashioned way, via IPOs.
The following were picked out by &lt;a href="https://gritcapital.substack.com/x"&gt;Grit Capital&lt;/a&gt; as having done spactacularly&amp;nbsp;well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Esports Technologies (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EBET&lt;/span&gt;) | Market cap: $290M | &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YTD&lt;/span&gt;:&amp;nbsp;251%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UTime Limited (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UTME&lt;/span&gt;) | Market cap: $98M | &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YTD&lt;/span&gt;:&amp;nbsp;207%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZIM&lt;/span&gt; Integrated Shipping Services (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZIM&lt;/span&gt;) | Market cap: $5B | &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YTD&lt;/span&gt;:&amp;nbsp;199%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global E-Online (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GLBE&lt;/span&gt;) | Market cap: $8B | &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YTD&lt;/span&gt;:&amp;nbsp;128%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FIGS&lt;/span&gt;, Inc (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FIGS&lt;/span&gt;) | Market cap: $7.4B | &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YTD&lt;/span&gt;:&amp;nbsp;127%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Edward Snowden on conspiracy&amp;nbsp;theories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/01/edward-snowdon-conspiracy-theories-belief-powerlessness"&gt;Edward Snowden writes that it&amp;#8217;s not the wild conspiracy theories that we should be worried about, but the open manipulation of our behaviour by mainstream institutions.&lt;/a&gt; 
Persuading everyone to install an app like the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; Covid 19 app on his or her phone is an example of a conspiracy in plain sight.
The idea that we&amp;#8217;d all walk around with an app designed by the government to monitor with whom we come into contact is &amp;#8230; Orwellian, but somehow because the app is branded with &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; we all install it. 
It is actually nothing to do with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt;, because ministers knew that a lumbering dinosaur of an organization like the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; would never be able to develop such a thing in a sub-decade&amp;nbsp;timescale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trump&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/01/nyregion/allen-weisselberg-charged-trump-organization.html"&gt;Everyone, I suspect, knew that Trump cheated on paying taxes. Only now he&amp;#8217;s disappeared from the scene are the authorities willing to risk taking action against him.&lt;/a&gt;
Well, not really against him yet, but they&amp;#8217;re warming up for it.
Maybe people were more persuaded of Trump&amp;#8217;s virtue than cynical me, and this is why so many Americans voted for him. Or maybe they voted for him while holding their nose. 
Or maybe they voted for him because he was smart enough to not pay taxes, and they wanted to stick it to the boring establishment that notionally play by the&amp;nbsp;rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe this is just a witch hunt, and his accountant will be full exonerated, and Trump will ride the wave of sympathy to become the 47th president. 
I simply have no idea what might happen, which is what makes &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; politics such a great spectator&amp;nbsp;sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indictment took square aim at Mr. Weisselberg after months of increasing pressure on him to offer information that could help that broader inquiry. Prosecutors had subpoenaed Mr. Weisselberg’s personal tax returns and bank records, reviewed a raft of his financial dealings and questioned his ex-daughter-in-law — all part of an effort to gain his cooperation. That effort is expected to continue, and now Mr. Weisselberg is under even greater pressure: He could face more than a decade in prison if he is&amp;nbsp;convicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump was not charged, and no other executives were accused by name of&amp;nbsp;wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to remind you, &lt;a href="https://www.earnthenecklace.com/charles-kushner-facts-to-know-about-jared-kushners-father/#:~:text=Jared%20Kushner%20rarely%20talks%20about%20his%20father%2C%20and,and%20was%20sentenced%20to%20two%20years%20in%20prison."&gt;Trump has form for associating with tax&amp;nbsp;evaders.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Telegraphic&amp;nbsp;Transfers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.netinterest.co/p/the-long-slow-short?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTAyMDI1LCJwb3N0X2lkIjozODMwOTgxMywiXyI6Ii8rREdaIiwiaWF0IjoxNjI1NDkzNTY5LCJleHAiOjE2MjU0OTcxNjksImlzcyI6InB1Yi00MzU1OSIsInN1YiI6InBvc3QtcmVhY3Rpb24ifQ.d2jIUAuM0unBWQ587DjETKT1tuDc9tyPDn6N8pEuFwk"&gt;This amazingly interesting read explains why it is so hard to make money by shorting a stock based on understanding how disruptive technologies are going to play out.&lt;/a&gt;
The first example is horses. Although Ford was churning out Model T&amp;#8217;s in 1905, it wasn&amp;#8217;t until 1920 that the number of horses in use was clearly declining. Fifteen years is a long time to wait for an investment idea to bear&amp;nbsp;fruit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other example, which is fascinating, is Western Union. This is a company that has been in decline since 1856. But it&amp;#8217;s still profitable! It took thirty years for the number of &amp;#8220;telegraphic transfers&amp;#8221; to halve. Even now, many decades since telegrams simply ceased to exist, people will still refer to an electronic transfer as a &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; (i.e. &amp;#8220;telegraphic transfer&amp;#8221;). This is insane, given that the telephone was patented in&amp;nbsp;1876. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not just that the force of habit is very strong, it&amp;#8217;s that competitors all exit a market, leaving the residual player able to extract rich economic rents. Who else offers a cash transfer from Patagonia to Timbuctoo? If you need to get that money between those places, you have nowhere else to go. Especially for the great unbanked, who make up the vast bulk of the human&amp;nbsp;population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A very durable business!" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9362585c-b668-4228-bbb5-2c2ce7371151_648x468.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inflation transitioning from economic statistic to political&amp;nbsp;football&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/EpsilonTheory/issues/epsilon-theory-zeitgeist-the-political-autotuning-of-inflation-657168"&gt;Ben Hunt argues that nowadays your view about the future path of inflation is likely to get you shot down as being a partisan.&lt;/a&gt;
It hasn&amp;#8217;t happened yet in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, but we nearly always seem to follow the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; in these matters.
Once we get a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPI&lt;/span&gt; print of 5% per annum or above, we&amp;#8217;ll get the finger pointing and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CB&lt;/span&gt; spokesmen talking about how this is all &lt;em&gt;transitory&lt;/em&gt;. 
The voice in the wilderness now is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jun/30/bank-of-englands-andy-haldane-warns-of-inflation-rises"&gt;Andy Haldane&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;#8217;t expect him to remain alone for&amp;nbsp;long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Covid &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; transmitted long distances via&amp;nbsp;aerosols&lt;/h2&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s rather long and detailed, but the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TL&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DR&lt;/span&gt; seems to be that medicine is very siloed and doesn&amp;#8217;t welcome input from physicists who really know about how suspended particles move in the&amp;nbsp;air.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s hard to invest in farmland, but fertilizers are a reasonable proxy.
As usual, I am looking for a catalyst to get the stock moving, and an anti-dumping investigation, with the threat of quotas and tariffs provides lots of economic rents for suppliers at home and abroad.
Oh, consumers of food have to pay more, but they don&amp;#8217;t employ lobbyists, so nobody cares about them, especially when nobody outside the industry joins the&amp;nbsp;dots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIP&lt;/span&gt; Donald&amp;nbsp;Rumsfeld&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was smart and conscientious, but ultimately worked to start wars in the Middle East that resulted in a horrible legacy of never ending Islamic terrorism. 
I don&amp;#8217;t suppose he could have known what the consequences of his actions would be (Cheney was the instigator, I&amp;#8217;ve read), but the fact that he was so embedded in the military industrial complex must have coloured his&amp;nbsp;judgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia is talking about increasing interest rates to quench inflation, which has recently ticked over&amp;nbsp;6%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy is having a great few months, but it is still low relative to materials (metals, wood, agricultural products). This is pointed out by Massif Capital, which offers a very nice free newsletter.  See &lt;a href="https://insights.massifcap.com/blog/shiftingfocus"&gt;the latest&lt;/a&gt; for some nice charts illustrating&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vols have been &amp;#8216;crushed&amp;#8217; lately. The Fed is smothering all signs of life in equities and bonds (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MOVE&lt;/span&gt;), and probably will try to keep doing that at least until J Powell has safely left the building. 
However, August is often when things blow up, so it might be worth watching the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; for the next few&amp;nbsp;weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NY&lt;/span&gt; Fed Weekly Economic Index is showing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; growth of over 10%. Obviously this is affected by base effects, but it&amp;#8217;s hard to believe this won&amp;#8217;t generate a bit of price&amp;nbsp;inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wallstreetonparade.com/2021/07/witness-drops-bombshell-at-house-hearing-hedge-funds-are-getting-100-times-leverage-on-crypto/"&gt;It seems that Binance and others are offering leverage ratios of 100 to 1 for hedge funds to speculate on crypto.&lt;/a&gt; 
As someone who has read Graham and Dodd and has studies securities for getting on for forty years, this makes zero sense to me. 
I think the blockchain is a wonderful technology, but it is no more than a rather inefficient database with a decentralized trust model. 
The world runs Victorian era paper-based systems (e.g. for international trade), but blockchain isn&amp;#8217;t really the solution. It is good old 1960s data processing. 
Paper is a decentralized model, but the trust model of looking at a squiggly ink line drawn on a piece of paper is barely better than the Roman&amp;#8217;s use of oaths sworn to minor&amp;nbsp;deities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.arpinvestments.com/arl/govcoin"&gt;Some people assume that the logical outcome of all this interest in crypto is a &amp;#8216;govcoin&amp;#8217;: a crypto currency issued by and tracked by the central bank.&lt;/a&gt; I can see the benefit, but I also think I&amp;#8217;d like to have the ability to buy and sell things without the government knowing all about the transaction, something the author seems to think is a bad&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love long-term charts, and one that goes back 150 years, especially for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; govt. data, is wonderful.
Admire this great work from the Visual&amp;nbsp;Capitalist:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;This market really is&amp;nbsp;crazy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Yes it is!" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5DvJl5XwAsHSh3?format=jpg&amp;amp;name=large"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Google has become bureaucratic and slow&amp;nbsp;moving&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/21/technology/sundar-pichai-google.html"&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NY&lt;/span&gt; Times has a story which says that Google&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; is risk averse.&lt;/a&gt;
Every other disruptive company has opted to defend its existing markets rather than keep challenging incumbents.
That&amp;#8217;s what monopolists do.
I am sure that the shareholders are&amp;nbsp;delighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Macro&amp;nbsp;matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China has huge demographic headwinds. 
It&amp;#8217;s like Japan, but worse.
Nobody is going to migrate &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; China. Anyone sensible with funds will &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTFO&lt;/span&gt;, especially when growth runs out because the labour supply has dried&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument made by Vincent Deluard is that China needs the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; to become a reserve currency, and that the only way this can happen is if &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; collateral is valuable and stable.
This is very bullish for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PRC&lt;/span&gt; bonds.
Individual companies may be taxed out of existence, but sovereign bonds will be solid.
I&amp;#8217;ve heard the argument that countries which need to be aligned with China because they are so tightly coupled with it for trade reasons (Vietnam, Korea) might be a better play, at least in currency terms.
But Deluard argues that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; bonds are the way to go.
To be fair, this is what Gavekal has been saying for&amp;nbsp;ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Deluard's charts" src="https://stonex--c.documentforce.com/sfc/dist/version/renditionDownload?rendition=SVGZ&amp;amp;versionId=0680h00000AkKvZ&amp;amp;operationContext=DELIVERY&amp;amp;contentId=05T0h00000dcCZF&amp;amp;page=2&amp;amp;d=/a/0h0000000XNj/DxsiliZVYsxtq0xoHUMZZ2Jk32kGDxX9GuEat7llrTA&amp;amp;oid=00DE0000000KCB8&amp;amp;dpt=null&amp;amp;viewId="&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StoneX goes on to say that the factors that make China want to preserve the value of its currency and bond market at all costs simply do not obtain in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;. 
From an electoral point of view, allowing the stock market to crash would be a disaster for both the Democrats and the Republicans. 
If the price of this is allowing a purging dose of inflation, the collapse of the dollar and double digit inflation, well, this is a price worth&amp;nbsp;paying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Deluard points out, with N. Pelosi having a $120M stock portfolio, which she actively trades, the establishment of the &amp;#8216;Left Wing&amp;#8217; party in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; maybe about to &amp;#8220;euthanize the rentier class,&amp;#8221;  but only those who have invested in Treasuries, and they are certainly not going to upset the&amp;nbsp;0.1%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; about China&amp;#8217;s demographic timebomb. Certainly, it seems likely that China will follow the route that Japan has been taking for a long&amp;nbsp;while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story has been touted for a long time. I think that it will come to pass, but there needs to be a catalyst for the trend to change. Emerging market fixed income has been negative to flat for a long time. Ultimately, this is because investors have more attractive assets&amp;nbsp;to &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wages of&amp;nbsp;sin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://yemen.forensic-architecture.org/"&gt;Yemen bombing map.&lt;/a&gt;
This is deeply depressing.
It shows the companies which made these arms, and the countries they are based in.
All bought by Iran and Saudi, whose proxy war has killed about a quarter of a million people out of a population of 28&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The case for a bull market in fossil&amp;nbsp;fuels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4436929-the-case-for-a-longer-term-oil-and-gas-bull-market"&gt;This article by Lyn Alden makes a detailed case for fossil fuels having a golden twilight.&lt;/a&gt;
The argument is that as the world gets richer, energy use per capita goes up rapidly, too rapidly for decarbonization can keep up. Meanwhile, capex is falling. 
Mix in the fact that most of the growth in population and wealth will be in emerging markets which don&amp;#8217;t have the political need to appear green and you get a strong bull&amp;nbsp;case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock picks (hers, not&amp;nbsp;mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For simplicity, investors can consider an oil and gas &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; like the iShares Global Energy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IXC&lt;/span&gt;) along with a uranium producer &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; like the Global X Uranium &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;URA&lt;/span&gt;) or the North Shore Global Uranium Mining &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;URNM&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of individual energy producers or transporters, I like names such as Canadian Natural Resources (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNQ&lt;/span&gt;), Lukoil (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OTCPK&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LUKOY&lt;/span&gt;), Enterprise Products Partners (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EPD&lt;/span&gt;), and Kazatomprom as buy-and-hold&amp;nbsp;positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equity markets grind higher: $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPY&lt;/span&gt; hits another &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATH&lt;/span&gt;, but generally markets lack&amp;nbsp;direction,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yields down a few bp (10Y now&amp;nbsp;1.44%),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;energy commodities continue to be strong, especially natural gas,&amp;nbsp;dragging &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;slight recovery of prices for precious metals, from a low&amp;nbsp;base,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; gaining, against &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EUR&lt;/span&gt;, 10bp, tracking &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LB&lt;/span&gt; (lumber futures) continue to be crushed, but $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WOOD&lt;/span&gt;, the forestry &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; has turned&amp;nbsp;around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;credit (e.g. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IBXXIBHY&lt;/span&gt;) continues to be strong. I think that when this edifice starts to totter, high yield credit will be where the cracks appear&amp;nbsp;first,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;continued anger over the collapse of the Florida apartment&amp;nbsp;block,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7.5% pop for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EV&lt;/span&gt; maker Xpeng ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;XPEV&lt;/span&gt;),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Didi, Chinese version of Uber sagged after &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IPO&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RobinHood fined for abusing its customers. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;70MM&lt;/span&gt;. About one quarter&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;revenue.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh what a dull day. No particular news. Probably biggest move was &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; up 20bp. No big deal, but it seems to have dragged energy commodities down.  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NZD&lt;/span&gt; was down 0.7%, so quite a big move, but it&amp;#8217;s not a deep market.

This is from Brent Donnelly, author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Alpha-Trader-Methodology-Mathematics-Professional/dp/1736739816/"&gt;Alpha Trader&lt;/a&gt;.
My takeaways from the summary&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your real stop loss is less than your notional one. Understand what you really stand to&amp;nbsp;lose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trade cautiously, especially at&amp;nbsp;first. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;understand that being up by 1% followed by being down by 1% will, cumulatively, wipe you&amp;nbsp;out,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don&amp;#8217;t be too proud to do a stupid trade. As long as it makes money, it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter if its&amp;nbsp;stupid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don&amp;#8217;t decide that the markets where you have an edge are too dull and that you&amp;#8217;ll start punting in markets you&amp;#8217;ve never traded&amp;nbsp;before,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep your powder dry. If you get allocated more capital, don&amp;#8217;t just use it up on day&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;always remember that the global macro cycle is the most important driver in nearly all&amp;nbsp;markets,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;don&amp;#8217;t be afraid to run against the crowd (especially when you&amp;#8217;re a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt; in a shop where everyone is on the other side of the&amp;nbsp;trade).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was a deflationary day.
Partly this was a jump in the value of $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FB&lt;/span&gt; which won some anti-trust action.
Bonds are strong, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt; is pretty flat, and commodities were on average flat.
Crude was down a lot, gas was up a lot, as was food.
Bitcoin was up 7%: there is lots of noise about central banks using digital currencies, the latest being Russia&amp;#8217;s.
I don&amp;#8217;t really see how the coming into existence of a competing product increases the price of the original one, 
but it must be the same reason that ten thousand different crypto currencies doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to diminish the appetite of the investing public for&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Monetizing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESG&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8212; with diesel&amp;nbsp;generators&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c376b2fa-1af5-4920-88cf-27ac297ed8f2"&gt;John Dizard has written a piece on diesel generators.&lt;/a&gt; He points out that as a result the phasing out of coal-fired power stations, power is a lot less reliable so people are buying their own diesel generators. The new F-150 from Ford even includes a 7.5 kW&amp;nbsp;generator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generac Holdings Inc. has been a huge beneficiary of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESG&lt;/span&gt; zealots. Its share price has risen tenfold in five years. 
I think that maybe Aggreko may be due to see some benefits, as it has not had anything like the same ramp up in profits or share&amp;nbsp;price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is Lacy Hunt predicting that bonds are going up in&amp;nbsp;price?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people would consider this as on a par with &amp;#8220;Is Boris Johnson economical with the truth?&amp;#8221;
Of course Lacy is predicting no inflation, but I am sure he&amp;#8217;s inserting a few caveats. 
I suspect that one of them is that the Fed reserves, which are currently money only for banks (which cannot actually spend it) do not get magically transformed into money for the consumer, via some sort of central bank digital&amp;nbsp;currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will listen to to the podcast, not least because I need to listen to someone with a point of view which is opposed to me. 
I will not be able to convince myself, let alone other people, that inflation is coming if I do understand the argument that it is not at least as well as its proponents, like Dr&amp;nbsp;Hunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thesoundingline.com/dr-lacy-hunt-inflation-and-growth-are-peaking-excessive-debt-is-deflationary/"&gt;Dr. Lacy Hunt: Inflation and Growth Are Peaking, Excessive Debt Is Deflationary&lt;/a&gt; via The Sounding&amp;nbsp;Line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ReconAfrica &amp;#8212; a&amp;nbsp;con?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://viceroyresearch.org/2021/06/24/reconafrica-no-oil-pump-stock/"&gt;Viceroy Research have done the hard&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shorting anything in this market is practically suicidal, so this is definitely not investment advice.
But I think it shows how the irrational exuberance of the market today is enabling this sort of&amp;nbsp;fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yes, the rich got richer. It&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;official.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, this was another reflation trade day.
Bonds drifted down a bit, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; held steady, the equity markets were up a bit and commodities overall (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSCI&lt;/span&gt;) were flat. 
Oil managed to eke out a 1%&amp;nbsp;rise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACWI&lt;/span&gt; was up&amp;nbsp;40bp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Core &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PCE&lt;/span&gt;  was up 3.4% YoY. 
This is pretty steep, given that all the expensive stuff is kept out of the index.
I guess everyone was expecting this, otherwise the bond market and dollar would not have been so sanguine.
I would not be surprised to see some soft of reaction in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt; market, except that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; and Japan are probably going to show some similar figures.
The stimulus spending, another $1.3T agreed today, in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; is much heavier in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PCE&lt;/span&gt; deflator (the Fed&amp;#8217;s preferred measure) was up 3.9% YoY. This is sanitized relative to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPI&lt;/span&gt;, and must be a big worry for the Fed. 
Of course they are maintaining their &amp;#8220;transitory&amp;#8221; narrative, because they are desperate to avoid tapering (i.e. buying Treasuries at a slightly slower rate than $120B per&amp;nbsp;month).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My view is that five year Treasuries are going to take a hit, fairly soon. &lt;em&gt;Not&amp;nbsp;advice!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BoA sees up to four years of&amp;nbsp;hyperinflation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/bofa-crashes-transitory-party-sees-4-years-hyperinflation"&gt;Here is the link (ZeroHedge: you have been&amp;nbsp;warned).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Not all assets have inflated equally." src="https://cms.zerohedge.com/s3/files/inline-images/asset%20price%20inflation%20Goldman%20June%202021.jpg?itok=OPzckDsM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the head BofA strategist concludes, it is &amp;#8220;tough to solve inequality with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt;.&amp;#8221; If only anyone at the Fed had this degree of&amp;nbsp;clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nearest equivalent, it is asserted was &amp;#8216;65 to &amp;#8216;68. I was around, but I was not following equity markets at the&amp;nbsp;time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Here is the dispersion of returns." src="https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_mobile/public/inline-images/60s%20analog.jpg?itok=Swzt-fnY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the 60&amp;#8217;s it was small caps that were the winners and real estate that barely moved. I doubt if they will repeat the trick, but really it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter much. Equities as a class did pretty well. 
I think the only lesson to be drawn is that in this sort of environment it&amp;#8217;s dangerous to be short of any real or financial asset. Even&amp;nbsp;bonds!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;El Salvador and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government of El Salvador is planning to airdrop ~3,000 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; into the hands of its&amp;nbsp;citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they can’t even print money to buy the&amp;nbsp;Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be really crazy to think about 10 years from&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1408272559192252423?s=20&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know enough about this experiment to have a handle on the consequences.
 I don&amp;#8217;t know anything about El Salvador.
 I do know that Maduro of Venezuela was promising an oil-backed cryptocurrency for Venezuela, to replace the worthless predecessor, but as far as I know it never happened and, presumably, the economy became&amp;nbsp;dollarized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ray Dalio and Denis Gartman are saying this is a good time to buy&amp;nbsp;stocks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cynic in me tells me that these guys don&amp;#8217;t come on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNBC&lt;/span&gt; to tip their hand.
They tell people to buy when they want to sell.
I might be totally wrong, and these guys might like to share the profits around to the little guy, and pay their taxes. 
But every time I err on the side of giving these guys the benefit of the doubt, I&amp;nbsp;err.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EXX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net profit margin: 32%
Return on investment: 16%
Revenue has grown monotonically over last 5 years.
Price/cashflow per share: 5.2
Tot. debt/Tot. capital:&amp;nbsp;23%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks too good to be true, eh?
The problem is that this is a coal miner with most of its operations in an increasingly unstable African country, South Africa.
Maybe Ramaphosa will grip the politics and put &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt; back on the economic growth track, but the obstacles against this are huge. 
I have never believed that a company with bad economics can be &amp;#8220;turned around&amp;#8221; but a celebrity manager, and I believe the equivalent thing about a&amp;nbsp;country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Exxaro might be worth further investigation. Buying on the local exchange (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSE&lt;/span&gt;) means that you are long coal and short &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZAR&lt;/span&gt;, so even if the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt; economy ends up as a basket case, the stock price will look&amp;nbsp;good.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Better late than even later</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/better-late-than-even-later.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-06-24T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:53+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-06-24:/better-late-than-even-later.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/the-secret-3-step-master-plan-to"&gt;Packy McCormack writes about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;-first&amp;nbsp;companies.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code is powerful, but that power comes only when there is something to connect it to.
When I was a programmer, I spent some time writing screen drivers, i.e. a set of calls to allow an application program to make things happen on the monitor in front of him.
Now, companies are employing people to write code to make things happen in their real life: e.g. taking money from their bank account to put it into securities. This sort of thing is difficult because real life was never designed to be driven by&amp;nbsp;software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, read the piece. It&amp;#8217;s excellent.
Stripe is a wonderful company. It looks as though these two have the potential to emulate&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The West, in opposition to communism, has become&amp;nbsp;fascist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fascism should more properly be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power.” — Benito&amp;nbsp;Mussolini&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is generally attributed to an article written by Mussolini in the 1932 Enciclopedia Italiana with the assistance of Giovanni Gentile, the&amp;nbsp;editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://www.politicalresearch.org/2005/01/12/mussolini-corporate-state&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Banks stress test results out&amp;nbsp;today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is expecting that, backstopped by the Fed, the banks will be able to pay out much more capital than previously.
It&amp;#8217;s not obvious how a change of capital structure will change the valuation of the enterprise (didn&amp;#8217;t two academic economists get a Nobel Prize for saying that?), but it seems that it&amp;nbsp;does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a guilty pleasure of mine to read &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s normally pretty mainstream, but 
&lt;a href="https://www.rt.com/op-ed/527300-blackstone-asset-stripping-realestate-ripoff/"&gt;this article about Blackstone buying up housing assets in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; really goes for the&amp;nbsp;jugular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that there is a very tilted playing field involved here. 
Blackstone can access funds at a few basis points. 
The precariat is having to borrow from credit card companies at 30% (i.e. 3,000bp). 
The higher rate is to compensate the lender for the credit risk. 
But the high rate is itself the cause of that&amp;nbsp;risk!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, people do not buy houses on a credit card, but when people are buyers, their liabilities may push their marginal cost of funds to these levels. 
Once they have received the &amp;#8216;black spot&amp;#8217; of having an impaired credit score, their sins can never be&amp;nbsp;expunged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No we&amp;nbsp;can&amp;#8217;t!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that EVs need about 0.3 kWh per mile to travel. 
I don&amp;#8217;t know if the other figures here are right, but they don&amp;#8217;t sound&amp;nbsp;wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2020, the United States had 1,117,475 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MW&lt;/span&gt;—or about 1.12 billion kilowatts (kW)—of total utility-scale electricity generating capacity and about 27,724 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MW&lt;/span&gt;—or nearly 0.03 billion kW—of small-scale solar photovoltaic electricity generating&amp;nbsp;capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from&amp;nbsp;https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/electricity-in-the-us-generation-capacity-and-sales.php&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems intuitively obvious that to replace the energy distribution capability of petrol and diesel in a country, the electricity generation capacity is going to be massively ramped&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;Some quick napkin math
Per 1M EVs on the road driving 12K miles/year require ~400GWh 

286M EV cars on the road (US) will need ~114TWh capacity

US capacity had 1.12TWh in 2020

Solar cost (retail) at ~$2.75/watt would be ~$314T to get to 114TWh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOOP&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TRCH&lt;/span&gt;, another Ponzi stock slumped 26%. See &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4406983-torchlight-0_35-value-at-25-percent-merged-company"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for an explanation why.  Note that when this article was written, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TRCH&lt;/span&gt; was trading at about $1.5. It is still above $5. This is the problem of identifying a&amp;nbsp;fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil ground higher. Most energy stocks were up, and copper and other miners.
Range Resources ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RRC&lt;/span&gt;) was up 9%. This is a natural gas company, involved in fracking.
This might be a better nat. gas play than the commodity itself, via futures.
&lt;em&gt;Not investment&amp;nbsp;advice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fed and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MBS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thesoundingline.com/?mailpoet_router&amp;amp;endpoint=track&amp;amp;action=click&amp;amp;data=WyIxNDM3IiwiMWk3MmtvbXlvZndnczQ0ZzhjYzg0Y284azA4b3Nvc2ciLCIxNDg2IiwiNzllMDUzYWQ0ODM5IixmYWxzZV0"&gt;Our Problem in a Nutshell: Why Is the Fed Still Buying $40 Billion a Month of&amp;nbsp;Mortgages?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $120 billion-a-month &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; program that the Federal Reserve has been running since last Spring includes $40 billion-a-month of Mortgage Backed Securities (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MBS&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the Fed is buying $480 billion of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MBS&lt;/span&gt; a year, a pace equivalent to roughly $74,000 per home sold in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; this year or about 25% of the value of current home sales. If you buy a home this year, there is a decent chance that the Federal Reserve will end up holding your&amp;nbsp;mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not too surprisingly, home prices are screaming higher at the fastest pace since 2006. That was right before the last housing bubble burst in spectacular&amp;nbsp;fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the Sounding Line, sounding off again about the problem with the Fed. 
With Blackrock buying up a lot of single family houses, this seems just wrong. 
I sort of understand why &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; is needed (although I doubt if it creates inflation), but buying commercial, long-dated paper seems&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why did gold sell&amp;nbsp;off?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4435595-gold-what-i-think-about-the-recent-selloff?mail_subject=must-read-gold-thoughts-about-the-recent-selloff"&gt;This article says that it is unfathomable.&lt;/a&gt;
Well, I agree, but  in the short run I&amp;#8217;d prefer to say out of&amp;nbsp;gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, it doesn&amp;#8217;t make sense for other real assets to be rallying against gold. 
Real rates are strongly negative, which a positive for the metal: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TIPS&lt;/span&gt; are yielding something like&amp;nbsp;-2.5%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s just a herd reaction, I guess. Some inflation hawks have moved money into crypto, but I am not sure how much longer that is going on.
In the short run, all markets are voting machines. And people don&amp;#8217;t like gold right now, and because they don&amp;#8217;t they convince themselves that we&amp;#8217;re heading for deflation. Or the other way&amp;nbsp;around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Twitter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/coloradotravis/status/1407488962847936513?s=20"&gt;This is a great thread that makes the point that money now is not the same as money at some point in the future, as they are not subsitutes, but that they can be traded and the price of the trade is the discount factor, i.e. the interest rate.&lt;/a&gt; I haven&amp;#8217;t done justice to this great explanation, so you should follow the link.

Powell is due to go in Feb., and the last thing he wants to do is start a stockmarket crash before he has made his exit.
The market is betting that $120B of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; will continue unchanged until the heat death of the universe, and who can blame&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, all global equities were up. 
Nothing really matters any longer apart from the&amp;nbsp;Fed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other markets, the dollar is heading back down again, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; is at 91.74. I would guess this will continue, i.e. down 0.17%.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; bounced to $32K.
Most other currencies moved in line with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities were mixed, with oil down 0.8% with most food.
Lumber continues to&amp;nbsp;crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds were flat: 10Y at&amp;nbsp;1.465%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With risk assets so strongly correlated because of the dominant role of the Fed, it&amp;#8217;s hard to hedge specific risk, or succeed in a classical hedging strategy. The Fed is having a strongly negative impact on what repressing the normal processes of creative destruction in the economy.
It makes everyone (Dave Portnoy) look like a stockmarket&amp;nbsp;genius. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;International Economics and&amp;nbsp;Policy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m reading Krugman and Obsfeld&amp;#8217;s book on International Economics and Policy. 
It&amp;#8217;s actually extremely readable, and could easily be absorbed by a non-specialist.
It goes through the theory of how tariffs and quotas and policies which add friction to international trade &lt;em&gt;generally&lt;/em&gt; make the world, and the countries imposing these policies, poorer places.
However, it points out that some trade barriers do make citizens better off. 
One example is Saudi Arabia. If &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KSA&lt;/span&gt; sold oil at the cost of production, it would certainly be worse off today, in terms of the welfare of its citizens.
This is an anomalous case. Krugman shows how these situations can arise, while pointing out that for most &amp;#8220;small&amp;#8221; countries (which cannot affect world prices by imposing barriers) are not in this&amp;nbsp;category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has a great description of the various &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GATT&lt;/span&gt; trade rounds, and the process of negotiating a trade deal. I read the financial press fairly religiously (the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;), but I felt that I understood these things much better. For example, I now know the difference between a free trade area (like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAFTA&lt;/span&gt;) and a customs union (like the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;). There is a lot to be said for the latter, as the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; govt. is discovering now in relation to Northern&amp;nbsp;Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oil price&amp;nbsp;thesis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4435380-100-wti-crude-oil-here-it-comes"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is worth reading.
The thesis is that supply is constrained, because nobody will fund upstream and exploration, demand is picking up, because of the end of the pandemic, and the dollar is going&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any one of the premises could be challenged, but it&amp;#8217;s hard to argue that Romil Patel is 100%&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great&amp;nbsp;chart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Net Zero is anything but a free&amp;nbsp;lunch&lt;/h2&gt;

Well, they would, wouldn&amp;#8217;t they?
If stopping using natural gas, oil and coal was such a no-brainer economically, there would not be any need for vast amounts of government regulation and subsidy.
If these things are necessary, there will be a heavy economic price to pay.
It will be paid by poor people in the rich world, but it will not work because rich people in the poor world will not risk riots caused by imposing impossible costs on their&amp;nbsp;populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nunziato_frank/status/1407126081883213824?s=20"&gt;Guess which stock this is…. 1.  Last week a director purchased nearly $21,000,000 of this company’s stock on the open mkt.  2.  This morning unusual options activity came in for nearly $1mm in premium in one print purchasing a 50% &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OTM&lt;/span&gt; call 5 months out. 3.  Stock is under&amp;nbsp;$10.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIG&lt;/span&gt; (Transocean). Someone thinks that we&amp;#8217;re gonna get some drilling&amp;nbsp;going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dynagas, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LNG&lt;/span&gt; carriers. This makes the bull&amp;nbsp;case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, this is a play on six &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LNG&lt;/span&gt; carriers. 
It is losing&amp;nbsp;money, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is highly geared, and has preferreds, but its cashflow is strong, and has solid operational profits.
Whether or not you think it&amp;#8217;s a good investment really depends on your view on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LNG&lt;/span&gt;. 
Personally, I think it has a future as a clean alternative to coal which is not prohibitively expensive to produce or to&amp;nbsp;transport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of last week, markets were spooked by the Fed saying that they might need to raise rates a tad by the end of 2023.

&lt;p&gt;At the end of last week, markets were spooked by the Fed saying that they might need to raise rates a tad by the end of 2023. 
Given we had an inflation print of 5% a few weeks ago, this seems like stating the obvious.
James Bullard, president of the Reserve Bank of St Louis made some anodyne remarks, such as that the Fed might stop buying mortgage backed securities (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MBS&lt;/span&gt;).
The market reaction was to swoon, with the major indexes dropping by several&amp;nbsp;percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not write a Wrap on Thursday or Friday, because I didn&amp;#8217;t really understand what was going on.
It didn&amp;#8217;t seem possible that such innocuous statements from the Fed could explain the market reaction.
Sure enough, today everything went into reverse. Commodities, stocks … all risk assets&amp;nbsp;climbed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In detail: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; lost 0.4%, oil gained 2.6%, gold gained 0.8%, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; gained 1.5%.
However, bitcoin lost 7.7%.  $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSTR&lt;/span&gt; (Microstrategy), which seems to have turned itself into an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPV&lt;/span&gt; for owning bitcoin, fell nearly&amp;nbsp;10%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lightning&amp;nbsp;Network&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1407030518483410951?s=20"&gt;The Lightning Network&lt;/a&gt; seems to be a layer built on top of bitcoin which fixes the problem of slow transactions and vast power consumption needs.
I don&amp;#8217;t really know how it works, but I did install a wallet which allows me to use the network. It&amp;#8217;s called Lightning, but there are others which might be better: I did minimal research: I just wanted to experience the speedup. I need to find someone on the same network to pay&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Transferwise&amp;nbsp;story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.netinterest.co/p/money-without-borders-a-peek-inside"&gt;It&amp;#8217;s worth reading how Transferwise (Wise) got&amp;nbsp;started.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks have a huge inbuilt advantage. The get massive economies from being at the nexus of many payments. 
This was recognized a long time ago. 
This is why banks make such huge income from making entries in ledgers: an activity which has zero marginal cost.
Maybe all this will be rendered obsolete by&amp;nbsp;crypto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/playboyhodl/status/1407041043464396801?s=20"&gt;Someone pointed out on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;  that Western Union invented telegraphic transfers a hundred and fifty years&amp;nbsp;ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1871, Western Union invented the wire transfer. Cost 3%, took 2-4 days, and a person had to transfer physical money on horseback. 150 years and multiple technological revolutions later, a wire transfer still costs 3% and takes 2 days. &lt;img alt="Exploding head" src="https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f92f.svg" title="Exploding head"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ziglu&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know much about Ziglu. I installed it on my phone. It seems to let me lend crypto. 
If crypto is a substitute for money, it will need to do all the things I can do with money. 
Probably the most important of these two is to lend, i.e. allow me to buy or sell money today in exchange for a fixed sum of money in the future. 
I am reasonably convinced that crypto has utility, but that&amp;#8217;s a very different matter from it having&amp;nbsp;value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oil going to the&amp;nbsp;moon!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/commodities/oil-about-benjamin-oil-hits-3-year-high-bofa-now-sees-spike-100"&gt;Oil may go higher!&lt;/a&gt;
Well, producers are being forced, by activists or by legislation, to stop investing in production, but no practical substitutes for the actual good have been found. 
This, to me, adds up to a bull case.
It&amp;#8217;s nice to know that the Bank of America, using a more sophisticated argument, comes to the same&amp;nbsp;conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Oil plunges</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/oil-plunges.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-06-17T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:53+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-06-17:/oil-plunges.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Inflation is on the rise.

One party of me wants to think that this is part of a coordinated reverse pump, coordinated by Klaus Schwab, but I just can&amp;#8217;t see them coordinating action in so many&amp;nbsp;markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some very popular (in a pejorative sense) newsletters are now getting very fired up about inflation. 
The latest from HedgeEye is full of doom and gloom. 
I know that the establishment cannot even bear to think about thinking of the consequences of inflation on the (budget) deficit, but are they really playing big markets, like oil? It just seems&amp;nbsp;unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Forward indicator suggests &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; is heading&amp;nbsp;down&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/weekly-economic-index#/interactive"&gt;It&amp;#8217;s probably all noise, but that&amp;#8217;s what the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NY&lt;/span&gt; Fed&amp;nbsp;says.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DKNG&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8212; not entirely&amp;nbsp;legit?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/draftkings/"&gt;Unbeknownst to investors, DraftKings’ merger with SBTech also brings exposure to extensive dealings in black-market gaming, money laundering and organized&amp;nbsp;crime.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulgaria is a hotbed of criminal activity. This sounds&amp;nbsp;plausible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Central bank balance sheets then and&amp;nbsp;now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://moneyinsideout.exantedata.com/p/the-remarkable-expansion-of-global?utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=copy"&gt;Chris Marsh with a historic and international overview of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CB&lt;/span&gt; balance&amp;nbsp;sheets.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not sure I understand all of this, but I understand some, and that part seems right and is extremely&amp;nbsp;interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It points out that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt; cannot start to tighten, ever, because of Target 2&amp;nbsp;balances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/michaelxpettis/status/1405539470741364745?s=20"&gt;This thread&lt;/a&gt; argues that debt (not just debt purchased by the central bank) was growing unsustainably in China and that this will cause huge problems for the regime there.
I don&amp;#8217;t know enough about China to have an opinion, but clearly China has been addicted to debt-funded creation of vast quantities of physical capital, which it has combined with its seemingly bottomless supply of labour to produce annual growth of 6% for the last couple of decades. 
I guess it makes sense that this won&amp;#8217;t go on for ever, especially with the demographic challenges that China&amp;nbsp;faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not all that is golden&amp;nbsp;glisters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4433962-golden-matrix-group-reboot-of-a-toxic-penny-stock-disaster"&gt;Golden Matrix is a carbon copy of management&amp;#8217;s former penny stock, Elray Resources, which ran into issues with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEC&lt;/span&gt;.     While the company only has two actual employees, there is a catalog of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEC&lt;/span&gt; sanctioned individuals and firms that have been involved at Golden Matrix and Elray.     The company&amp;#8217;s operations are a complicated web of related party transactions which obfuscate an otherwise trivial&amp;nbsp;business. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s interesting that banks are offering prime brokerage services to entities other than hedge funds.
One thinks that people like Elon Musk would be the ideal customer for a bank like Credit&amp;nbsp;Suisse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities were massacred today.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; was flat. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; up 1%.
Generally a deflationary day, presumably triggered by weak initial claims figures (i.e. higher than expected numbers filing for&amp;nbsp;unemployment).&lt;/p&gt;

Bonds, though, didn&amp;#8217;t think this would be enough: the 10Y yield went back up to 1.57, up&amp;nbsp;7bp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, a tiny bit of excitement on a hot summer evening. 
European indexes were up, but I think the markets may have closed by the time of the rate hike intentions had been&amp;nbsp;released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other economic news, housing starts were strong: 3.6% MoM. I think that the disaster that was housing in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; in 2009 may finally be healing.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EQR&lt;/span&gt; might be a way of playing&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;

The important prices have all been directionless for a month: the 10Y yield, the dollar index, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LIBOR&lt;/span&gt; (via the Eurodollar futures contract), even broad commodity indexes like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSCI&lt;/span&gt;.
Even the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACWI&lt;/span&gt; global equity index is only 1% up on a month ago.
Everyone is waiting for the Fed to tip its hand.
The one price that is moving is oil. 
This is steadily moving up, as demand picks up, but supply is taken out because of pressure from green activists and governments looking to secure the youth&amp;nbsp;vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one equity market that is moving is Europe, via the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DJ600&lt;/span&gt;, although it is only crawling up the&amp;nbsp;hill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;the economy is a car that has the handbrake off, and has started rolling down the hill. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOMC&lt;/span&gt; is in the driver&amp;#8217;s seat pressing the pedal to the&amp;nbsp;metal,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ED&lt;/span&gt; futures hit all time high, 3M &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LIBOR&lt;/span&gt; now at under&amp;nbsp;12bp,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;asset managers are less exposed to commodities than they have ever&amp;nbsp;been,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greek bonds are paying negative interest rates. People are &lt;em&gt;paying money&lt;/em&gt; in order to lend money to serial defaulter Greece, where not paying your taxes is a patriotic&amp;nbsp;duty!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOMC&lt;/span&gt; is the most important ever. We might see tapering, or at least evidence that Powell is thinking about thinking about&amp;nbsp;tapering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Paul Tudor Jones interview is &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/14/paul-tudor-jones-says-bet-heavily-on-every-inflation-trade-if-fed-keeps-ignoring-higher-prices.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, complete with helpful transcript. 
My reading (of the transcript) is that he wants to keep some inflation hedges in his portfolio, even if the currently neutral or deflationary environment endures and the Fed&amp;#8217;s rhetoric about &amp;#8216;transitory&amp;#8217; inflation is believed or turns out to be&amp;nbsp;true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; rental costs vary by a factor of&amp;nbsp;two&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.spareroom.co.uk/where-can-you-afford-to-live/"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; shows that if you wish to live in central London, you&amp;#8217;ll be paying double the rent in some of the less fashionable parts of the&amp;nbsp;country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are &lt;em&gt;room&lt;/em&gt; rents. To pay £900 pcm for a room needs a salary of at least £30K.  This is miles above min&amp;nbsp;wage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government drone on endlessly about &amp;#8220;levelling up.&amp;#8221; People who are forced to work in London, because that&amp;#8217;s where their industry is based, are getting a terrible deal compared to those who can work from the periphery. 
I can&amp;#8217;t help wondering whether the red-listing of European holiday destinations is not a cunning plan to curry favour in the Skegnesses of this world. 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; seaside destinations have been hammered by the rise of Benidorm and Ryanair. 
Boris doesn&amp;#8217;t lose any votes to speak of by sticking it to these two, but will earn gratitude in Jaywick and Margate and even Southend on&amp;nbsp;Sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But think of all that money that cuddly Mr Buffett gives&amp;nbsp;away&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not convinced that Warren Buffett is the benign grandfatherly figure that he appears to be. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/13/opinion/warren-buffett-billionaire-taxes.html"&gt;Neither is Anand Giridharadas.&lt;/a&gt;
The background is that Warren Buffett pays no tax. Well, a negligible amount, in terms of his wealth, and annualized increase in wealth.
Hicks, the famous economist, once defined income as that amount of money that you can spend in a year without being worse off at the end of it.
On this definition, Buffett has plenty of income, but they tax system doesn&amp;#8217;t recognize the Hicks definition. Instead, it taxes the sort of income that wage slaves receive from their&amp;nbsp;employers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I urge you to read the article. Nothing will change, though, as the Warren Buffetts of this world are much too influential. 
No matter how electorally popular, political parties cannot survive without plutocrat donations, so we are in a sort of Mexican&amp;nbsp;standoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will things change? It seems unlikely. It seems more likely that the West will follow Latin America, where whoever you vote for, he is on the payroll of the 0.1%.
I might sound like a batshit crazy Marxist conspiracy theorist, but a lot of damaging policy choices made by governments throughout the world can be perfectly explained by the idea that they are in the pocket of&amp;nbsp;billionaires.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inflation, Part 94: Interest income channel: why &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; is&amp;nbsp;deflationary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edward Harrison &lt;a href="https://pro.creditwritedowns.com/p/risks-to-growth-and-inflation-helping?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=cta&amp;amp;action=share"&gt;argues&lt;/a&gt; that by the Fed (and other central banks) buying up all the yielding assets (longer dated govt. bonds), the interest income to the private sector is squashed, thereby draining demand out of the&amp;nbsp;economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is certainly consistent with what happened in Japan.
The collapse in yields lately points to a similar process. 
Will the impact be limited to a collapse in yields, or will it collapse the price of real assets too?
Maybe it&amp;#8217;s too soon to&amp;nbsp;say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chimes with what I heard on &lt;a href="https://pileusmmt.libsyn.com/104-john-t-harvey-inflation-stagflation-healing-the-nation"&gt;this podcast&lt;/a&gt;.
I haven&amp;#8217;t listened to the full podcast, but this one argues that inflation in the 1970s was caused principally by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OPEC&lt;/span&gt; oil shock.
This argument doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to explain Turkey, S. Africa, Zimbabwe or Wiemar, but I haven&amp;#8217;t listened to the full&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Yes, inflation is coming.

&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows that inflation is coming. 
You can&amp;#8217;t read a newspaper or look at an email newsletter without being reminded of that.
The problem is that it&amp;#8217;s difficult converting this knowledge into money.
Maybe buy real assets: lumber, perhaps?
But then you remember …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;#8217;s it all&amp;nbsp;about?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows that inflation is coming. 
You can&amp;#8217;t read a newspaper or look at an email newsletter without being reminded of that.
The problem is that it&amp;#8217;s difficult converting this knowledge into money.
Maybe buy real assets: lumber, perhaps?
But then you remember that lumber futures have quadrupled in price over the previous year, which makes buying now a tad risky.
(Yes, I know that there is autocorrelation in these&amp;nbsp;things.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other tactic is to sell bonds. Inflation goes up, interest rates are composed a of an element compensating for risk, and an element compensating for inflation.
So, nominal yields are gonna go up, so bonds are gonna crash, right? Actually, no. 
The Fed controls the short end. And you can hedge your long-dated bonds with a rolling series of short term positions. 
If the Fed keeps short rates at zero, then long rates will remain at zero.
Or the Fed will just keep buying long-dated bonds until the result is achieved.
Will this stop inflation? Hell, no! But it will protect holders of long-dated bonds, and more importantly, keep funding costs low for the&amp;nbsp;government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TIPS&lt;/span&gt;? Yes, these guarantee a fixed real return. But it&amp;#8217;s negative, around 80bp. So, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, you get protected, but it&amp;#8217;ll cost&amp;nbsp;ya!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe gold. The ultimate store of value, trusted by humans for thousands of years.
In such an inflationary environment, gold prices must be rocketing, right? 
Actually, not so much.
This is why the media deride Peter Schiff so much.
He&amp;#8217;s only saying explicitly what most serious commentators know: that gold will catch a bid.
But he&amp;#8217;s not putting in many caveats, and is explicitly saying &amp;#8220;buy gold&amp;nbsp;now.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else? Well, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; is a possibility. When we roll over into inflation, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; will get hit, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; will start to rise again.
But, like the other real assets, it has been crushed, so maybe, again, the time is not yet&amp;nbsp;ripe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion of all this is: put tight stops on exposure to bubble assets, and maybe hold some small precautionary positions in geared reflation assets. 
Not investment advice:&amp;nbsp;obviously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;However&lt;/em&gt;, Edward Harrison &lt;a href="https://pro.creditwritedowns.com/p/risks-to-growth-and-inflation-helping?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=cta&amp;amp;action=share"&gt;argues&lt;/a&gt; that by the Fed (and other central banks) buying up all the yielding assets (longer dated govt. bonds), the interest income to the private sector is squashed, thereby draining demand out of the economy, which is of course&amp;nbsp;deflationary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is certainly consistent with what happened in Japan.
The collapse in yields lately points to a similar process. 
Will the impact be limited to a collapse in yields, or will it collapse the price of real assets too?
Maybe it&amp;#8217;s too soon to&amp;nbsp;say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another day of calm before the storm? I have no idea, but the day had no real&amp;nbsp;direction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;equity indexes mainly gained new all time&amp;nbsp;highs,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bitcoin staged a bounce back&amp;nbsp;(6.3%),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;currencies more broadly were very flat (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; actually&amp;nbsp;0%),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;commodities were mixed. Oil ground higher, by 30bp, but generally quiet. Lumber continued to collapse: down&amp;nbsp;6%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bonds sagged a bit. Maybe someone read my inflation shroud-waving above (or one of the 10K similar&amp;nbsp;ones),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How much does it cost to set up a crypto bank to lend stable&amp;nbsp;coins?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out to be &lt;a href="https://www.netinterest.co/p/my-adventures-in-cryptoland"&gt;not very much at all&lt;/a&gt; to lend crypto using defi.  The key technology is ethereum. 
It&amp;#8217;s a fantastic technology, with amazing&amp;nbsp;utility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is, does that utility turn into value?
It seems to me that the answer is &amp;#8220;no,&amp;#8221; because there is simply no limit to how much can be produced.
Nobody made any money out of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;, or web servers, or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TPC&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;. They are wonderful technologies, which transformed the world. But they did not make money for anyone&amp;nbsp;directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sure, people made money in ventures that utilized that technology. Where would Amazon be without &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TCP&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;? (I know it also depends on a whole host of other clever tech, like public key encryption, that underpins https&amp;nbsp;too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lightning&amp;nbsp;Network&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t really know what this is, but I&amp;#8217;ve seen it speed up and reduce the cost of bitcoin transactions by a lot.
You can read about it &lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lightning-network.asp"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
It seems to use Ethereum smart contracts to conduct transactions &amp;#8216;off blockchain.&amp;#8217; Yes, I&amp;#8217;m waffling, but read the thing yourself.
One thing I can understand is that with a private key, I can enter into a binding contract with another party on the same network to agree I owe money (for coffee etc.).
I can see that using &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; as collateral for this could remove credit risk.
Same goes for any crypto currency, I&amp;nbsp;guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I installed Zap on my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt;, and I&amp;#8217;ll have a play with the network. 
I did look at paying for something with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; today, but then I discovered that it had to be routed via BitPay, which requires registration etc. and so is no more anonymous than PayPal. I was just renewing a domain name registration, but I thought it was interesting. So few &amp;#8216;normal&amp;#8217; retailers even take&amp;nbsp;BitPay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Corporate Taxes are a&amp;nbsp;distraction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://thesoundingline.com/corporate-tax-revenues-are-irrelevant/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brutal truth is that hardly any tax revenue is raised by taxing profits.
Company boards have a choice about funding their activities with debt (or equity that looks enough like debt that the tax authorities treat it like debt), so in a sense all corporate taxation is&amp;nbsp;voluntary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The G7 position on corporate taxes is yet more political theatre, designed to make the proles think that governments are on their&amp;nbsp;side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, a risk-on day.
Crude up, equities up, bonds up, long-duration stocks outperform value.
No obvious driver.
Lots of coverage of a new motor in the Tesla Model S, which would take it to 200 mph, if only it had tyres and brakes and cooling that were of the right&amp;nbsp;spec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What caught my attention&amp;nbsp;today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.econtalk.org/ian-leslie-on-conflicted/"&gt;This Econtalk episode&lt;/a&gt; was good.
It made the case that it&amp;#8217;s good to be wedded to an idea, and it&amp;#8217;s good to argue about it, and it&amp;#8217;s good to have conflict.
And these idea apply to marriages as much as to committees and boards.
Ian Leslie argues the case that, actually, to make an argument effectively you have to be invested in it and actually not make it calmly and rationally.
It&amp;#8217;s a sort of defence of the British idea that justice is served by an adversarial&amp;nbsp;process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found it interesting, in that it argued that simply having diversity of skin colour was not nearly enough.
You have to recruit partisan opponents.
This is, of course, just another argument for having laws made by debates in parliament, not by a kitchen cabinet of cronies.
Unfortunately, this seems to happen less and&amp;nbsp;less.&lt;/p&gt;

It requires uniformed volunteers to take on well-funded incumbents who are paid public money to bat away difficult&amp;nbsp;questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A free press is a buttress against tyranny, for sure. But in the age of social media, the mainstream media seems an irrelevance. 
The Guardian seems to be hemorrhaging cash, and seems a very unhappy ship indeed, with a lot of very unhappy and underpaid journalists.
&lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9669115/Guardian-chief-executive-Annette-Thomas-quits-just-15-months-job-600-000-payoff.html"&gt;Inevitably, the Daily Mail indulges in an orgy of &lt;em&gt;schadenfreude&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but you can see why they would&amp;nbsp;gloat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPI&lt;/span&gt; came in at 5%, but absolutely nobody blinked. 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; flat, oil flat (well, up 30bp), equities (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt;) up 44bp (which practically counts as flat), bonds up, 10Y yield now at&amp;nbsp;1.46%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market met the highest inflation print for 13 years with a huge yawn. Jobless claims down to 376K, half the level of April 2020, was shrugged off.
Alex Manzara saw this coming: &lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/cpi-already-in-the-rearview-mirror/"&gt;Alex Manzara reckons that whatever the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPI&lt;/span&gt; print is, it won&amp;#8217;t matter.&lt;/a&gt;
I think that until the asset bubble bursts, we will not see inflation.
People are ploughing every last bean of their spare cash into bitcoin, property, classic cars, wine &lt;a href="https://newseu.cgtn.com/news/2021-06-10/This-1-cent-Magenta-stamp-is-now-worth-8-3m-10Z0XncGafC/index.html"&gt;and even insanely expensive stamps&lt;/a&gt;.

In other words, the much trumpeted G7 agreement is a substantial cut in taxes for the profitable &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; digital services companies.
It&amp;#8217;s funny how the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; and, presumably, the rest of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSM&lt;/span&gt; have conveniently omitted to report&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yields on the 10Y continue to drift down.
I don&amp;#8217;t really know why this is, but I&amp;#8217;m wondering if it is because marginal buyers have decided that most of the big fiscal stimulus bill that has been announced by Joe Biden will never become law. 
With Clinton era Democratic figures like Larry Summers saying that this is a bad idea, maybe old Joe has lost his nerve, and Karmala has understood that business doesn&amp;#8217;t want to see wage costs taking off.
Maybe I&amp;#8217;m just too&amp;nbsp;cynical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Predicting&amp;nbsp;politics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politics for most people is a spectator sport.
Each of us has a team, which we want to see win. 
We think about the arguments for and against a policy, and decide what needs to be done.
But this is a very poor way to predict what will&amp;nbsp;happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people agree, if they are asked, that children are our most precious resource, and that no reasonable expense should be spared in having the state provide a good environment in which they can grown and learn. 
This clearly includes paying childcare workers a generous wage to ensure that there is enough labour market competition to ensure that only reliable, conscientious and intelligent workers are recruited into this most responsible profession.
In practice, this simply doesn&amp;#8217;t happen. 
Why it doesn&amp;#8217;t must be something to do with what voters &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/six-hundred-atlantic/season/two/ep-2-us-history-hides-clues-about-child-care-and-the-fight-for-reform.aspx"&gt;This podcast&lt;/a&gt; explains what the problem is. 
Voters don&amp;#8217;t like free universal childcare, because they think it will disproportionately benefit the poor (and in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, black women), and also because it will put pressure on more women to work when in the current system they have no alternative but to stay at home and look after their young children: something they actively would prefer to&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result, both in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, is a poor-quality, short-hours publicly funded system for those who have no option, and a wildly expensive system for that minority women who want to work in professional, high-paying jobs. 
The result is a mess, but is entirely&amp;nbsp;predictable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also notable that no large corporate interest is behind a reform in state child care provision, which is another block on&amp;nbsp;change.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Another day in Paradise, but not for Bezos, Buffet or Bloomberg</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/another-day-in-paradise-but-not-for-bezos-buffet-or-bloomberg.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-06-08T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:52+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-06-08:/another-day-in-paradise-but-not-for-bezos-buffet-or-bloomberg.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy generally was up, as were energy stocks. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTU&lt;/span&gt; was up 11%! 
Starving energy companies of capital will not directly reduce the demand for oil, which continues to go up and an undiminished rate.
Mark Carney can bleat on about &amp;#8220;stranded assets&amp;#8221; as much as he likes, but developing economies are going to want power stations that can be constructed quickly and cheaply, run 24x7, are compact, and can be located close to centres of population. Coal, oil and natural gas will be the winners. China may slow down building coal plant, but they will make sure that Vietnam gets the coal stations that would otherwise have been built in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PRC&lt;/span&gt;. I don&amp;#8217;t argue for a moment that this is a good thing. I am just trying to guess what is going to happen. I leave what &amp;#8220;should&amp;#8221; happen to the politicians, who prefer to keep things very&amp;nbsp;vague.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yup, inflation was &amp;#8220;transitory&amp;#8221; between 1974 and 1981&amp;nbsp;too&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/villains-and-heroes/"&gt;Alex Manzara riffs on inflation&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Inflation and unemployment in the 70's" src="https://www.chartpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CPI-UNEMP-1977-1024x491.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we&amp;#8217;re going to see this&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that there are arguments to say that the demand for money is much greater now, for collateral purposes, so the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; and M2 explosion don&amp;#8217;t matter so much now. This was argued in &lt;a href="https://macromusings.libsyn.com/david-andolfatto-on-a-standing-repo-facility-the-future-of-cbdc-and-plumbing-issues-in-monetary-policy"&gt;the latest edition of Macro Musings&lt;/a&gt; (which is always worth listening to).
I certainly think we won&amp;#8217;t get a repeat exactly of this. 
Maybe the 40&amp;#8217;s will be a better comparison. Nobody remembers the 40&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; 50&amp;#8217;s being inflationary, probably because the govt. took no action to suppress it, so people still got to borrow at&amp;nbsp;2%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really don&amp;#8217;t know what will happen, but more people seem to be predicting inflation than predicting the&amp;nbsp;opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Global minimum tax&amp;nbsp;rate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The G7 finance ministers met in London over the weekend. 
I&amp;#8217;m sure the travel created a few tonnes of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CO&lt;/span&gt;~2~ equivalent.
The communiqué is typically vague. 
A minimum figure for tax is quoted, as a percentage of corporate profits, but no mention is made of how to measure profits.
It&amp;#8217;s well known that average corporation taxes are less than half of marginal rates, as a proportion of reported profits.
Companies report many different profit rates, including the notoriously &amp;#8220;Community Adjusted&amp;#8221; rate of We Work. 
Vague statements like this are the lifeblood of the lobbying industry. 
I am confident that the CEOs of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; lost no sleep over the G7 announcement, which was just one paragraph&amp;nbsp;long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Propublica Tax&amp;nbsp;Leak&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax"&gt;As everyone knew, billionaires pay no Federal Income tax.&lt;/a&gt; Their companies arrange for them to get richer (than Croesus), and then they fund their lifestyle against their wealth by borrowing.
Anyone can do this: start a company, own a good chunk of it. Make profits. Use these profits to buy back shares (but not those owned by the founder). Watch the share spike in value, borrow against them. Rinse and repeat.
Buffett, Bezos and Bloomberg paid tax at a rate of less than 1.3%. Buffett paid 10bp on his increase in wealth.
Elon Musk paid only 3.27%, a figure that will have plummeted as he became the world&amp;#8217;s richest&amp;nbsp;man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure that these billionaires are furious, but the cat is out of the bag. I just hope that whoever did the leaking covered his tracks well.
These guys have plenty of money and will use it to destroy anyone who stands up to them.
It might be worth downloading the article to read at leisure, as it&amp;#8217;s perfectly possible that Bezos is pulling the plug on the Pro Publica servers as we&amp;nbsp;speak.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Another dull day with trade policy comment</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/another-dull-day-with-trade-policy-comment.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-06-07T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:52+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-06-07:/another-dull-day-with-trade-policy-comment.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sharing the benefit&amp;nbsp;equitably&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politicians have very short-term thinking, but that&amp;#8217;s understandable.
A case in point is trade policy: everyone (maybe even politicians) know that we are all better off if we drop tariffs to zero.
But this is in the long term. Because factors of production like labour are not very mobile, when a country opens up to trade with China,
it would be expected that production shifts to those sectors where we have a comparative advantage: e.g. insurance underwriting, or trade finance.
But the people who worked in shoe factories in Northampton will not move to the City to work as quants.
It takes time for labour markets to clear, and in the meantime, politicians lose their&amp;nbsp;seats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m reading Krugman &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Obstfeld on International Economics. 
It&amp;#8217;s actually a fairly easy read.
It once again shows that our chronic inability to compensate losers, both short-term and long-term, has been absorbed by voters, who now are unwilling to allow any change.
I cannot see how change can happen given the current institutional architecture we have.
Classically, constitutions exist to protect minorities that might be oppressed by majority voting.
We need something to unlock the mechanism for&amp;nbsp;change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of a valley which happens to be the obvious route for a new road. There are a hundred landowners along the length of the only practical route.
None will sell, because every one wants to be the last hold-out seller, who can extract an economic rent of 100% of the net benefit of building the road.

Hourly wages increased 0.5% MoM, more than the 0.2% expected.
I am not sure whether this adds up to very much, other than that the economy is still in recovery&amp;nbsp;mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude was up, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; was down. The Turkish Lira continues a very slow drift down against the euro.
Gold recovered some of its recent losses.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSCI&lt;/span&gt; was up about&amp;nbsp;1%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Carried&amp;nbsp;Interest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carried interest is one of those many things which exist purely because they are a form of tax arbitrage.
By taking the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPV&lt;/span&gt; of a stream of performance-related fees and taking the sum as a stake in a the assets of a fund, what would ordinarily be treated as income becomes transformed into capital gains.
Because the tax system taxes cash flows differently according to when they are received, classifying them into &amp;#8220;income&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;capital gains&amp;#8221; this results in a considerable tax saving for the managers.
The practice was strongly defended in the letters page of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; today, responding to &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e9fae12d-17bc-47e3-80ad-b52d7e58fd2e"&gt;a report that Scottish Widows has called for this arrangement to be scrapped&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;h2&gt;Limits to&amp;nbsp;accounting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baruch Lev wrote &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9f77bf14-6cad-48d2-b068-e625ed44f1fd"&gt;a thoughtful piece in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; today&lt;/a&gt;.
He pointed out that when a company is mainly investing in software, R&amp;amp;D and intangibles, it expenses the whole amount immediately, even though it creates an asset that drives future profits and cashflow.
The classic example is Amazon and Google and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFLX&lt;/span&gt;, which are spending tons of money creating an infrastructure which is practically unmatched.
For me, the whole distinction between an expense and an asset is wholly artificial.
Using free cash flow allows a somewhat better comparison between businesses which invest in real assets and those which invest in intangible ones. 
I doubt if the comparison is that good however. 
Really, it&amp;#8217;s up to the analyst to understand whether a software business really is creating an enduring competitive advantage, and therefore has created some valuable intangibles. 
I think that deciding on that will always be above the accountant&amp;#8217;s pay&amp;nbsp;grade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Insurance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principal agency problem is a big one. 
Economics works best when principals transact directly: when the farmer sells his produce to the housewife.
Of course, the modern economy is increasingly characterized by long chains of intermediaries, not least when it comes to insurable risks.
Akerlof (husband of Janet Yellen) got a Nobel Prize for writing about the market for lemons, i.e. cars which sellers know have faults, where those faults are undetectable by buyers.
This asymmetry of information leads to a failure of the market to clear at a price which maximizes utility.
It seems to me that all purchases of insurance are of this sort: if I insure my house against fire, or earthquake, the underwriter is enormously better informed about the real risks that I am running than I am. 
Moreover, even if I could estimate the risk accurately, and knew the cost (e.g. of rebuilding) I would probably willingly overpay for insurance, &amp;#8220;just to be on the safe side.&amp;#8221;
I think this problem is behind the out-of-control level of prices for medical care in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;.
I don&amp;#8217;t think it was a surprise that both Ben Graham and Warren Buffett decided to base their investing around an insurance underwriter (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GEICO&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great thing about being an underwriter is that if you are big enough, the government will bail you out even if you misprice risk and would otherwise be bankrupted by claims (exhibit A: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIG&lt;/span&gt; in&amp;nbsp;2009).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Reflation trade starts to move, possibly</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/reflation-trade-starts-to-move-possibly.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-06-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:52+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-06-01:/reflation-trade-starts-to-move-possibly.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; has suddenly jumped off the low of about 16 to about 17.9. 
This is quite a big percentage jump (although, conceivably, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; could drop to zero, in which case we&amp;#8217;d see much bigger percentage jumps).
It seems odd that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; didn&amp;#8217;t move but the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; jumped.

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s interesting is that the whole thing is centred around stablecoins: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DAI&lt;/span&gt;, Tether and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USDC&lt;/span&gt;. 
Getting hold of these is not that easy, and transaction costs are high, but they clearly have more utility as a store of value and especially a means of payment that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This piece appeared in Grant&amp;#8217;s Almost Daily Faulty Towers. You can subscribe for free via &lt;a href="https://www.grantspub.com/"&gt;the main website&lt;/a&gt;. I enjoy Grant&amp;#8217;s take on the market, but this daily letter is as much as I can get&amp;nbsp;through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grant&amp;#8217;s called out the craziness of the Global Financial Crisis for several years before it finally broke. 
I feel that the same applies today: Grant&amp;#8217;s is right, but early, therefore wrong in a trading sense. But when this market breaks (and it will be a global recession), China real estate developers will get swept away as by a&amp;nbsp;typhoon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A real estate division of China Oceanwide Holdings Co. (715 on the Hang Seng) defaulted on a $280 million dollar bond earlier this week, Bloomberg reports.  The conglomerate, which was only able to repay roughly half that principal sum using the proceeds of a recent private bond offering, stated in a filing that the rest of the funds are forthcoming in the next three months. A scuttled attempt at $1 billion-plus of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; asset sales preceded this week’s&amp;nbsp;development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oceanwide has been in trouble for some time. Two years ago, the company abruptly ceased construction on a $1 billion downtown &lt;span class="caps"&gt;L.A.&lt;/span&gt; condominium, hotel and retail complex “due to a recapitalization of the project,” as the Los Angeles Times put&amp;nbsp;it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The property sector remains in focus for all the wrong reasons, as Chinese developers had already accounted for more than a quarter of the $20 billion in missed bond payments this year as of last week, according to data from&amp;nbsp;Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, the authorities look to crack down on financial shenanigans within the all-important property realm.  To that end, Caixin reports that regulators are scrutinizing mega-developer China Evergrande (3333 on the Hang Seng) for its ties to lender Shengjing Bank.  Per the report, Shengjing holds “large amounts” of Evergrande debt on its books, while Evergrande is Shenjing’s largest&amp;nbsp;shareholder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pair have a history. Back in summer 2019, Evergrande shelled out &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; 13.2 billion ($2.1 billion) to raise its stake in Shengjing to 36% from 17%, paying a 40% premium to the bank’s share price.  Subsequent reports indicated that the Chinese government “encouraged” the deal to help recapitalize&amp;nbsp;Shengjing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to today’s news, the developer’s dollar-pay 8 3/4% notes due 2025 dropped to 81 from 84, for a 1,429 basis point spread over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; Treasurys (traditionally, a pickup in excess of 1,000 basis points indicates borrower distress). Single-B-plus-rated Evergrande sports $117 billion in net debt, equivalent to 8.5 times consensus 2021 Ebitda.  The company has pledged to cut its debt load in half by the end of 2023, as it attempts to reach compliance with Beijing’s recently implemented “three red lines” governing property developer balance&amp;nbsp;sheets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solvency trouble at Evergrande, which Grant’s predicted in fall 2017 will eventually take its place in history alongside “Bank of United States” and “the Hindenburg,” could reverberate far and wide. Chinese corporate borrowers face a hefty $1.3 trillion in domestic debt maturities over the next 12 months, per data from Bloomberg, with $900 billion of that falling due before year end.  That compares to $1 trillion by June 2022 and $600 billion by December 31 for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; companies, and $800 billion and $400 billion, respectively, in principal repayments for European corporate borrowers.  Chinese firms have already defaulted on more than &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; 100 billion of onshore debt this year, marking the first time that threshold had been crossed before&amp;nbsp;September&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, Mr. Market continues to whistle past the high-rise.  Bloomberg notes that a quartet of Chinese property developers (Yango Group, Greenland Hong Kong Holdings, Times China Holdings and New World Development Company) are marketing dollar bonds&amp;nbsp;today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oh, no, not more&amp;nbsp;crypto!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About half the financial news media space is occupied by stories about crypto currencies.
It&amp;#8217;s a fascinating topic, for sure. When I first heard about bitcoin in a podcast in April 2011, I was hooked on the subject.
I actually had used public key encryption, and was familiar with how public key cryptography works, at least from a user&amp;#8217;s perspective. I published my own gpg public key way back in 2000. 
I have no idea how the general public think about &amp;#8220;crypto&amp;#8221; now. 
As I have said from time to time, the value of bitcoin is a pure measure of sentiment, and there is still a lot of positive sentiment.
People assume that now Goldman Sachs are putting out research notes about &amp;#8220;crypto&amp;#8221; being a new asset class, there must be something to this thing. After all, most people don&amp;#8217;t really understand how Netflix makes any money (it doesn&amp;#8217;t) but still wishes it owned shares in it (they go up. And up.&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8230;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, as you can tell, crypto falls firmly into the &amp;#8220;a worthless asset trading at a premium price&amp;#8221; category, but as with most things it this category, until the broader market becomes unambiguously bearish, it&amp;#8217;s best to sit and&amp;nbsp;wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9aee2f71-2d95-4be2-a2df-5dcab2a2a3ff"&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; is clearly a sceptic.&lt;/a&gt; The article points out. The title is &amp;#8220;Goldman’s not giving up hope on Bitcoin&amp;#8221; with a subtitle &lt;em&gt;Where there’s a prime brokerage opportunity, there’s a way. And if there’s a whale, there’s a&amp;nbsp;will.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PBoC executing stealth &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt; purchases to prevent &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNY&lt;/span&gt; from rising to its natural&amp;nbsp;level?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://moneyinsideout.exantedata.com/p/china-bop-part-iii-back-in-the-manipulation"&gt;This piece about how the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNY&lt;/span&gt; is being artificially held down by its central bank&lt;/a&gt;. The amazing thing is that the work is made available to all without charge. I don&amp;#8217;t know much about &lt;a href="https://moneyinsideout.exantedata.com/"&gt;Ex-Ante Data&lt;/a&gt; but I&amp;#8217;ve subscribed to their Substack and look forward to reading more research from&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My instinct is that resources, including currency, will flow to East Asia, and to China in particular, over the next decade. The growth in population, and productive capacity is irreversible, in my view (which is conditioned by hearing too much guidance from Gavekal Research, I&amp;nbsp;fear).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it&amp;#8217;s always nice to have one&amp;#8217;s priors confirmed, and this is an example for me. 
However, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt; is a tricky asset, as it is subject to heavy manipulation by political actors who can quite happily do things which are hugely destructive to their economies to thwart the actions of &amp;#8216;speculators&amp;#8217; who simply are trying to improve price discovery. Soros broke the Bank of England, but you never hear of the times he tried to out-stare a central bank somewhere and blinked first. I can&amp;#8217;t believe he got to be as rich as he is without having good risk management in&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fusion power: no longer twenty years to achieving commercial&amp;nbsp;viability?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/first-results-from-uk-experiment-point-to-a-solution-to-one-of-fusions-hottest-problems"&gt;This press release&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AERE&lt;/span&gt; suggests that we are getting closer than ever to making nuclear fusion economically&amp;nbsp;viable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first job was with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UKAEA&lt;/span&gt;, and I visited Culham, which was very close to the site where I worked, Harwell. It was a standing joke that governments had infinite patience to continue funding fusion research decades after the point where the originators had promised that the technology would be an economic source of power. At that point, the fact that it produced no carbon emissions was not even a&amp;nbsp;factor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message then, as now, is that getting fusion to work commercially is &amp;#8220;merely&amp;#8221; an engineering problem. The physics is settled. Fusion works, and has been used to produce the most devastating weapon the planet has ever seen: the &amp;#8220;H Bomb.&amp;#8221; I sometimes feel that this is exactly the same attitude that prevails in discussion about carbon capture and storage, but I&amp;#8217;ll stop&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, maybe we are near to a breakthrough. Nuclear fusion would truly be a game changer. Apart from cheap, carbon-free energy, it has the huge advantage that there is no nuclear waste, to speak of, which has always been the Achilles&amp;#8217;  Heel of nuclear fission. Although I think we&amp;#8217;re nearly all much too afraid of radioactivity, it must be said that the idea of releasing Pu radioisotopes to circulating in the world&amp;#8217;s oceans for the next few hundred thousand years is not a nice legacy to leave for future&amp;nbsp;generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So nobody really believes the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMH&lt;/span&gt;. Everyone wants to feel good about spotting something that the rest of the market has&amp;nbsp;overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody wants to believe Cramer, or the dull analyst reports from the bulge bracket banks.
But, on the whole, they prove pretty accurate; of course they sometimes prove spectacularly wrong, and a few Cassandras point out how they were right all along.
But as long as more money flows into equities, and dilution is kept modest by buybacks undoing the dilutive impact of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; option grants, I am not sure there is &amp;#8212; even now &amp;#8212; any strong case of a major&amp;nbsp;correction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, events like 1987, 1992, 2000 and 2008 seem very scary at the time. But, in retrospect, it really is the case that buying the dip in the share prices of dull, well capitalized, profitable, conservatively managed companies will have produced a better return than calling and shorting the market immediately prior to the crash. Of course, the two strategies are not incompatible, but even someone like me, who is a terminal bear, must acknowledge&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transparency in public&amp;nbsp;life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An article in Private Eye pointed out that a lot of the beneficiaries of the hugely generous terms given to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PPE&lt;/span&gt; suppliers under the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PPE&lt;/span&gt; scramble a year ago went to small companies which would make use of the reduced disclosure rules for filing accounts at Companies&amp;nbsp;House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a great fan of the Norwegian system in which all tax returns are available for public scrutiny.
Nobody has to look if they do not want to.
The logic of having a public register of companies is to allow creditors to evaluation their credit standing. An abbreviated balance sheet is simply not enough for this.
If people do not want their profit and loss statement made public, they can operate as a sole&amp;nbsp;trader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I run a number of companies, and I am always surprised by the fact that accountants do not even give me the option of filing full accounts, assuming that all their clients will want to have as little information on the public record as&amp;nbsp;possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, my material creditors expect me to provide vastly more detail than a mere P&amp;amp;L statement, but it would be a start. Councils regularly contract with suppliers who supply the sketchiest detail about their financial activities, with the result that in a number of cases these suppliers go bankrupt before delivering on their contract. I can understand the under-capitalized company wanting to hide its precariousness from public view, but I do not understand why more solid businesses are so coy about their financial affairs. Apart from anything else, it would allow customers to see to what extent they are being ripped off. On average,&amp;nbsp;anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dovetails into another hobby horse of mine: hidden cartels. It&amp;#8217;s quite clear that very high returns on investment, or very high payments to the board are a sure sign of monopolistic profits, which we are supposed to regulate&amp;nbsp;away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was another extremely dull day. The only asset that seems to have anything resembling a well defined trend is gold, although that is not exactly strong.  I believe that real stresses in the financial system will show up first in currencies. Today the dollar index, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt;, moved by 3bp.

&lt;h2&gt;Controlling the&amp;nbsp;narrative&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Francine McKenna writes long detailed, forensic pieces about how frauds get committed, how the people who commit these frauds often get off Scot free because they are well connected, and the powers that be like to protect their&amp;nbsp;friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jay Clayton was notoriously averse to prosecuting egregious cases of stock price manipulation, most notoriously by Elon Musk. Now Trump has gone, there is a new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEC&lt;/span&gt; chair, Gary Gensler, ex head of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, often considered more effective than the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEC&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gensler has had a much better press than Clayton, because, presumably, from the point of view of the Washington Post he is &amp;#8216;our guy.&amp;#8217; McKenna thinks &lt;a href="https://thedig.substack.com/p/gary-gensler-is-not-the-guy"&gt;he&amp;#8217;s not the guy&lt;/a&gt; and makes the case that his involvement of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MF&lt;/span&gt; Global case is Exhibit A. Maybe I should have written &amp;#8216;his recusal, or non-involvement in the case&amp;#8217; but you&amp;#8217;ll have to read McKenna&amp;#8217;s piece for the&amp;nbsp;details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The political appointment of these regulators seems guaranteed to result in selection of individuals who are the choice of lobbyists. Washington truly is a swamp, as Trump declared, not that he had any intention of doing anything other than filling it with his own&amp;nbsp;alligators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this make any difference to me? Probably not, but because the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; has such a lively population of truly independent investigative freelancers like McKenna that we can get a glimpse behind the curtain, in a way that we don&amp;#8217;t in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. I don&amp;#8217;t really know why that is, maybe it&amp;#8217;s because things have gone further in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, and the abuse of power is more outrageous, and sufficient to make these heroes make the decision to make the sacrifice to make their fellow citizens aware of the abuses. I don&amp;#8217;t know, but I hope they&amp;nbsp;prosper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, Substack seems to offer a platform for this material, but we&amp;#8217;ve seen from Twitter&amp;#8217;s behaviour that once free speech gets to the point where it seriously challenges the &lt;em&gt;status quo ante&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8216;no platforming&amp;#8217; becomes a&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A post like this is not complete without a mention of the Martens who are indefatigable in calling out the abuses of the bulge bracket banks, for example in &lt;a href="https://wallstreetonparade.com/2021/05/this-is-what-jamie-dimon-will-tell-the-u-s-senate-today-with-annotated-text/"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; published&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vol. 2, No. 1 (Spring, 1971), pp. 3-21 (19&amp;nbsp;pages)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is fifty years old. 
I am not sure I&amp;#8217;ve ever read the original, but the ideas it contains, as popularized by academics such as Luigi Zingales and Russ Roberts have been hugely influential on me, and have been very influential in forming my political outlook.
The idea is simple: that regulation to protect the public can be structured in such a way as to protect incumbent suppliers of the regulated good or (usually)&amp;nbsp;service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS9YeXRQa3lkSQ/episode/NGMxMjdlZWEtZDA3OC00YzFmLWFhZmQtZWJhZDQ1ZDQ1MDk2?sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0CAUQkfYCahcKEwiI96awzdvwAhUAAAAAHQAAAAAQBA&amp;amp;hl=en-GB"&gt;An episode of Capitalismisn&amp;#8217;t&lt;/a&gt; was devoted to this article, which has some excellent illustrations of what can happen.
Probably the most egregious example of how the theory predicts what will happen in the banking industry is what happened with Dodd Frank, and in particular the Volker Rule, which is exquisitely crafted to protect the incumbents and create the illusion of protection to the public.
Quite obviously, the banks which were &amp;#8220;too big to fail&amp;#8221; in 2007 are much bigger and more dominant&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stigler was in favour of breaking up monopolies and using structural means of protecting the public, over complex rule books written by legions of lawyers who would be later able to make money by explaining how to skirt these&amp;nbsp;rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are not many ways of preventing the dysfunctional outcomes that Stigler&amp;#8217;s theory predicts. One is to create permanent incorruptible civil servants. As far as I know, the only state to have tried this seriously is Singapore. More generally, in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;, and increasingly in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, the regulators of finance and judges (who interpret the law itself) are paid a tiny fraction of what practitioners are paid. As Zingales says, it might be possible to persuade a judge to forego a career as a partner in a top law firm if he was expected to sacrifice only 20% of his possible salary, but if he is expected to forego 90% of it, we are doomed to have practitioners who are hugely more talented than&amp;nbsp;regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another issue is the sheer complexity of modern regulation. Dodd Frank &lt;a href="https://www.mercatus.org/publications/regulation/dodd-frank-one-biggest-regulatory-events-ever"&gt;is estimated&lt;/a&gt; to have introduced over 27,000 new restrictions on business activity. It is simply inconceivable that anyone has the time to read and understand this other than people paid as lobbyists to ensure that the regulation is ineffective in terms of limiting the power of large financial&amp;nbsp;institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to think about how a situation like this comes about. This is easy: the economic incentives are extremely large. And I like to think about how it might end or change. This is much more difficult to do. I suppose that, eventually, the deadweight costs of economic inefficiency resulting from the misallocation of resources will allow some other form of economic organization to overtake societies which allow Stiglerian regulatory capture. We might have to wait a long&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today almost literally nothing happened. 10Y yields hardly budged, and equity markets remained stalled.
The Ponzi sector mean reverted a bit, oil dragged many non-monetary commodities upwards, by a little. 
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSCI&lt;/span&gt; index was up 1.2%, with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CL1&lt;/span&gt; up 3%.
Gold was flat. 
Coal miners were down a lot. The see-saw between the rise of alternative fuels and the recovery of fossil fuel prices is likely to continue for the rest of this year, at&amp;nbsp;least. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Twitter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/profplum99/status/1395597098402426881?s=20"&gt;This is a fantastic thread&lt;/a&gt; about what the appropriate size of the state must be in order to carry out its proper function of protecting citizens against external or otherwise organized threats, and about how that size must change as a function of the size of these threats.
I think that the threat level is in some sense determined by the size of the state that can be plundered: seizing the reins of power in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; would take a big power (China, presumably), but the reward, in terms of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; state&amp;#8217;s reach both in it&amp;#8217;s control of its domestic economy and it&amp;#8217;s global influence are so great it might actually be worth that power attempting the job. Beefing up the army is not the best solution to the&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I don&amp;#8217;t agree with the solution, but I agree that there is a problem and anarchy is not a solution. Although David Friedman has some ideas which make some much reduced size of the state sound&amp;nbsp;feasible.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Market forgets about yesterday</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-forgets-about-yesterday.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-05-20T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:56+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-05-20:/market-forgets-about-yesterday.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Australia-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; Trade&amp;nbsp;deal&lt;/h2&gt;

The problem seems to be that farmers object to having to face competition from a country with a huge competitive advantage over the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; in beef production.
Ricardo understood that the economically rational decision was to get our beef from Australia, but he wasn&amp;#8217;t a politician, so I have no doubt that we&amp;#8217;ll succumb to some mercantilist&amp;nbsp;fudge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Market retrieves&amp;nbsp;poise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&amp;#8217;s market dip was reversed to day. 
Those traders who &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTFD&lt;/span&gt; were rewarded, as they usually&amp;nbsp;are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treasuries&amp;nbsp;up,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;equities up, almost&amp;nbsp;everywhere,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;commodities up apart from those dragged down by oil. The explanation seems to be that Iran will be released from sanctions, which will boost supply; the backwardation in futures prices in oil seems to be easing (i.e. the market is changing its mind somewhat about future oil prices being cheaper than&amp;nbsp;today&amp;#8217;s),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;precious metals retrace, a&amp;nbsp;little,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the dollar resumes it downward trajectory, against the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPY&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EUR&lt;/span&gt; (approx&amp;nbsp;0.4%),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bitcoin resumes upward&amp;nbsp;momentum,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; weekly unemployment claims&amp;nbsp;fall,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;several frontier and developing markets report strong growth, and produce prices&amp;nbsp;gains,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;housing market in Canada is still red&amp;nbsp;hot,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;many European markets (incl. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;) were strong. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; factory orders&amp;nbsp;strong.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Markets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed finally moved. Some committee members whispered the possibility of reducing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt;, or &amp;#8220;tapering&amp;#8221; in the jargon.
This knocked 3.2% off the price of oil (but see the item about the China credit impulse below).
The markets are fixated by the Fed, because it&amp;#8217;s all the is backstopping the market.
If the Fed blinks, the market will implode is the&amp;nbsp;consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I can&amp;#8217;t see this happening. The asymmetry of risks and rewards for the Fed committee is too great. Easing for too long will create some inflation, which&amp;nbsp;will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;give workers more money in their pay&amp;nbsp;packets,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;put a floor under the price of real assets like houses and&amp;nbsp;401Ks,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make mortgages more affordable, especially long-dated fixed rate ones which are unique to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make it easier for the Treasury to service govt.&amp;nbsp;borrowing, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;push down the dollar, thereby boosting the competitiveness of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; industry and making domestic producers of all products more able to defend their home&amp;nbsp;markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will of cause, in the long run create all the miseries that we associate with the seventies. But it could take a decade before these become serious, by which time J Powell will have had time to retire to his island in the Caribbean, and Biden will not care one way or&amp;nbsp;another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details for&amp;nbsp;today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all commodities&amp;nbsp;down,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dollar up 0.5% to&amp;nbsp;90.16,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; stock markets down, except &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; which is&amp;nbsp;flat,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; 10Y practically&amp;nbsp;flat,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Credit (e.g. Iboxx high yield corp. bond index) down&amp;nbsp;0.25%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;crypto currencies weaker, with linked stocks down (e.g. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIOT&lt;/span&gt; down 4.7%); bitcoin touched $30K, down from $59K a few weeks&amp;nbsp;ago.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect the market to bounce tomorrow. More and more big groups are defunding fossil fuel producers, so $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;XOM&lt;/span&gt; might struggle, as oil prices&amp;nbsp;rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Crescat Inflation&amp;nbsp;Bulletin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.crescat.net/may-research-letter/"&gt;Crescat&amp;#8217;s letter&lt;/a&gt; makes a strong case that this time it&amp;#8217;s not transitory.
I know you&amp;#8217;ve read a lot of similar arguments, but Crescat have assembled a very solid&amp;nbsp;case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Austerity is&amp;nbsp;inevitable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/austerity-goal-to-compel-workers-low-wages-by-yanis-varoufakis-2021-05"&gt;Yanis Varoufakis explains that avoiding austerity is politically&amp;nbsp;impossible.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all good Marxists, Varoufakis would be aware that &amp;#8220;inevitable&amp;#8221; is word beloved of Marx and his followers. The article explains that the powerful actors in society cannot tolerate any increase in interest rates (because capital is so highly geared), so more government spending, to fix inequality (or &amp;#8220;level up&amp;#8221; as the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; catch phrase has it) will provoke too much of a backlash before it can&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know whether this is an accurate account, but it&amp;#8217;s a persuasive&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Commodities under&amp;nbsp;pressure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="China credit is the culprit." src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F81db1061-9e25-4560-ac08-65e7cb6a105e_498x284.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China is the world&amp;#8217;s dominant consumer of most commodities. 
The authorities seem to be getting worried about overheating.
They are trying to make rating agencies get real about ratings for company debt in China.
This is all going to push down the demand for&amp;nbsp;commodities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, we&amp;#8217;re in an odd time, and some commodities, such as energy, have a global demand.
And probably battery factories will not shut down, which is good for lithium, cobalt and a host of rare earths. However, maybe copper and wood have&amp;nbsp;peaked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Forecasting inflation is&amp;nbsp;difficult&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="It sure is" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E1rMzQLXEAg8ix2?format=png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I post some variant on this chart from time to time.
Central banks have always underestimated the size of the output gap, which is why they keep overestimating inflation.
I think their measure of labour market supply is off. People live healthy lives well into their eighties now.
The pool of workers in their 60s and 70s means that whenever the labour market gets a bit tight, this extra supply puts a lid on&amp;nbsp;wages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The labour market is an incredibly complicated thing, I realize. But we simply have a lot of idle hands these days, probably an order of magnitude more than the unemployment statistics&amp;nbsp;indicate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/heimbergecon/status/1394530246498689026?s=20"&gt;A similar point is made in this tweet, which I noticed after having written the&amp;nbsp;above.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 2021, the biggest inflows have been into financials and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TIPS&lt;/span&gt;. This indicates that people are investing as though they believed that inflation is coming.
There are a few clever products that will allow cheap exposure to rapidly rising inflation (which will trigger a selloff in long-dated bonds). The one I am interested in is &lt;a href="https://www.simplify.us/etfs/pfix-simplify-interest-rate-hedge-etf"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PFIX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Note that I do not know exactly how this works, and it might be an expensive way of getting an equivalent exposure.
In particular, I don&amp;#8217;t know how it compares to buying puts on 30-year TBond&amp;nbsp;futures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No obvious direction. My view is that housing starts will be seen as an outlier, down to specific problems affecting the housebuilding industry, with general economic activity continuing to grow strongly, creating a headwind for the dollar and&amp;nbsp;yields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Manzara weighs in on inflation&amp;nbsp;expectations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think half the things I read in the financial press and online these days are about inflation.
Half the stuff says &amp;#8220;Inflation is here, but it&amp;#8217;s transitory.&amp;#8221; Half the stuff says &amp;#8220;Fed and Treasury policies cannot fail to spark inflation.&amp;#8221; Obviously, both cannot be&amp;nbsp;right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that to make money, one has to focus on what will happen, not what should happen. 
And, one has to focus on what will happen in the short term, because it&amp;#8217;s no good being right when we are all dead. 
It&amp;#8217;s clear that there is &amp;#8220;a lot of ruin in a nation.&amp;#8221; It&amp;#8217;s possible to imagine production being restructure, labour being re-trained, population being moved in a way that gets rid of the bottlenecks that give rise to rising labour costs for decades. 
The problem is political and practical. It&amp;#8217;s hard to retrain coal miners to be Python coders. It&amp;#8217;s hard to persuade parliaments that badly paid voters in areas of low housing costs to move to fill badly paid jobs in the centre of&amp;nbsp;London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Manzara sees inflation on the horizon and he&amp;#8217;s getting increasingly worried. Read more &lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/medium-of-transaction/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://corporate.nordea.com/article/65502/fx-weekly-oprahnomics-works-until-it-no-longer-does"&gt;This note&lt;/a&gt; gives a balanced view about whether or not inflation is coming.
For sure, it&amp;#8217;s not obvious that it&amp;#8217;s not slowing, but it&amp;#8217;s not obvious that it&amp;#8217;s going away&amp;nbsp;either.&lt;/p&gt;

Julia Galef emphasizes the metaphor of a map, representing how our thoughts about the world map onto the actual world. 
It is superficially reassuring to close our mind to ideas that may undermine our cherished beliefs, but it is not a route to happiness. 
It is a pity that most people are more concerned about convincing us that their point of view is correct than detailing the weaknesses in their own arguments. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s natural, as we may not have incentives which are perfectly aligned with those of our&amp;nbsp;audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000w6tr"&gt;Poor old Delia.&lt;/a&gt;
It&amp;#8217;s quite unusually, still, for someone from a working class household to go up to Cambridge (or Oxford) and it can lead to unhappiness. 
It&amp;#8217;s impossible to know why Delia took to drink, and ended up much less celebrated than she might have been. 
I think it would be interesting to find out, from a large scale study, how class origins impact the life experiences of Oxbridge graduates.
As with any study of class, such an undertaking is likely to be beset with methodological&amp;nbsp;difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Oil and the Fed</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/oil-and-the-fed.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-05-16T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:56+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-05-16:/oil-and-the-fed.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;History of the Fed and what its expanded mandate will do to the price of&amp;nbsp;crude&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a comment below the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WSJ&lt;/span&gt; story that explained how central banks were expanding their mandate to prevent global warming, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/central-banks-jump-into-climate-change-policy-fray-11621166402?commentId=e43d5880-c7b2-4682-bccc-83cd252070ca"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My concern is not whether banks will save the planet or not, but how this action will affect the price of oil. It seems to me that if you drain demand for securities issued by upstream oil, you should push the price down. But if you fail to push down the demand for the commodity itself, you&amp;#8217;ll push up the price of oil. Maybe the solution is to short $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;XOM&lt;/span&gt;, but go long $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CL1&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

It challenges the idea that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; are going down simply because inflation expectations are going up. I don&amp;#8217;t fully understand the argument, but my take is that Fed printing has to end up in assets somewhere, and investors have chosen momentum stocks because &amp;#8230; well, they know that momentum stocks keep going up. I guess this is what you might call Reflexivity. The author is a guy called Lyall Watson. I don&amp;#8217;t know if he&amp;#8217;s right, but I think that he must have a point that it can&amp;#8217;t be just people doing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DCF&lt;/span&gt; calcuation on $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFLX&lt;/span&gt; future free cash flow and using a higher rate. He makes the good point that we should use real interest rates to discount real cash flows, and if anything real rates are probably getting more negative, as nominal rates are going to be pinned to the lower bound for a long time beyond the point when inflation becomes&amp;nbsp;problematic.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a furious interest in Bitcoin this weekend as experts pile in to rubbish Elon&amp;#8217;s lack of understanding of crypto. 
I heard that the inventor of Dogecoin was asked about whether he took into account energy consumption when he designed the cryptocurrency, and he replied that he created it in a couple of hours and really didn&amp;#8217;t taken anything into&amp;nbsp;account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, the bulge bracket banks are looking to stuff their clueless clients with another worthless scam:  &lt;a href="https://wallstreetonparade.com/2021/05/morgan-stanley-has-paid-fines-for-two-decades-for-abusing-customers-with-in-house-products-now-it-plans-to-stuff-bitcoin-futures-into-its-mutual-funds-and-retiree-annuities/"&gt;Bitcoin futures for soon-to-be&amp;nbsp;retirees.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Have fun staying poor – if you want to save the&amp;nbsp;planet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An Inconvenient&amp;nbsp;Truth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-56723560"&gt;This &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51906530"&gt;this earlier one&lt;/a&gt;)  point out that extra wealth leads to extra emissions. 
It focusses on people in developed countries, but the fact is that developing countries are catching up, and will start to emit more&amp;nbsp;carbon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy stocks have been hammered because of the &amp;#8220;stranded assets&amp;#8221; theory that the global population   will soon be driving around in Teslas powered by wind farms. I&amp;#8217;m reluctant to say that an ex-Goldman banker, and serial central banker Mark Carney is an idiot, but frankly he must be if he thinks that the demand for oil in a couple of decades will not be higher than it is now. Maybe he&amp;#8217;s not an idiot, and he&amp;#8217;s just trying to manipulate the price of $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;XOM&lt;/span&gt; down so he can load up on long-dated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OTM&lt;/span&gt; calls. Whatever the reason, I think it&amp;#8217;s very dangerous to assume that fossil fuels have had their&amp;nbsp;day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But just ignore me, a Boomer. Listen to Mark, uh, also a&amp;nbsp;Boomer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Actually, he&amp;#8217;s probably just humouring his wife, who is some sort of Green&amp;nbsp;lobbyist.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trends in the&amp;nbsp;week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;short interest in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; at record lows: time for&amp;nbsp;selling?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="quo"&gt;&amp;#8216;&lt;/span&gt;retail favourites&amp;#8217; ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;APPL&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMZN&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFLX&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BYND&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARKK&lt;/span&gt;) are falling very fast relative to the index; $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;QQQ&lt;/span&gt; is weak relative to $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPY&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;selling of treasuries is&amp;nbsp;buildling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These will not come as a surprise to regular readers. 
I&amp;#8217;ve been predicting this for a very long time.
But this time the market is not actively laughing at me. 
The market is choppy, and the strong rally of $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; on Friday showed that it&amp;#8217;s much to soon to call a bear market.
But the bulls are now having to pick their stocks much more&amp;nbsp;carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Druck is bearish on $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/11/stanley-druckenmiller-says-the-fed-is-endangering-the-dollars-global-reserve-status.html?mc_cid=34a37ff919&amp;amp;mc_eid=8d66df2c11"&gt;Druck talks on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
He points out that the trend growth in retail sales represents a huge drawing forward of demand, generated by stimulus checks. 
He argues that the central case of interest rates going forward will make the debt financing cost of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury debt unsupportable, which will cause a dive in the&amp;nbsp;dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Druck is smart enough to say that he may be wrong, but it seems clear to me that he is basically right. He looks at flows to conclude that overseas (non-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;) investors have turned away from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasuries as the hedge asset for all equity investments. The impact on the dollar has been muted, because of heavy flows into &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; stocks, but this is about to reverse, which he says represents the turning point for the&amp;nbsp;dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am always sceptical of taking what Druckenmiller says at face value. He has no need for more wealth, but if he is going to make other people wealthy, he will do it through tax reducing charitable giving (maybe to Ivy League institutions). He will not do it by telling redneck investors how to front-run his&amp;nbsp;trades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, he may have put on these trades, and just be trying to whip up a bit of retail momentum. Who knows? The thesis is seductive, but I feel that there must be a catalyst to move the dollar down much more.
The problem is that the most likely dislocation event is a crash in equity markets. This will be strongly risk-on and will provoke a rise in both Treasuries and the&amp;nbsp;dollar.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Retail army advances</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/retail-army-advances.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-05-14T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:56+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-05-14:/retail-army-advances.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Retail Army regroups and&amp;nbsp;refocuses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tulipmania started during a&amp;nbsp;pandemic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just saying&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TS&lt;/span&gt; Lombard: &amp;#8220;Bitcoin is only worth what somebody else will pay for it. In this sense, there are obvious parallels with previous financial bubbles, especially Tulipmania in 17th century Amsterdam.&amp;nbsp;The&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dutch bubble, one of the most famous in history, also occurred during a global pandemic, a Plague that ravished early-modern Europe. While historical records are sketchy, it appears the Netherlands suffered a particularly severe outbreak of the disease between September and November 1636, which was just weeks before the price of tulips went “exponential” . One&amp;nbsp;popular&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;narrative blames excitable Dutch merchants who had nothing better to do than sit around in taverns bidding up the price of exotic flowers (global trade was effectively in&amp;nbsp;“lockdown”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;European yields pushing&amp;nbsp;higher.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting developments in recent months is that, for all the talk of higher inflation in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, bond yields have barely moved - the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; 10-year rate is still lower than it was in March. Conversely, the 10-year yields across the eurozone have generally been rising. Over the past month, moves have ranged from a rise of 18bp in Germany to an increase of 31bp in France. Italy’s is now above 1% again. All this means longer-term yields have been moving in Europe’s favor, which could weigh on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;/support the&amp;nbsp;euro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Fed is just a novice at this&amp;nbsp;game&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you compare the size of the balance sheet of some central banks, especially Switzerland and Japan, the Fed&amp;#8217;s balance sheet seems positively tiny. Mind you, the fiscal deficits are another&amp;nbsp;matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="image" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbaa8c596-606c-4919-b778-d52483e73e9f_495x285.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rising yields tilts the market towards value is a flawed&amp;nbsp;theory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check the argument &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/threadreaderapp/status/1393266153443692547?s=20"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, Jesse is saying that this cannot be right because you can&amp;#8217;t make money off the insight. It&amp;#8217;s not obvious how &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GM&lt;/span&gt; is a relatively better buy than &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; after interest rates have gone to 20%. Cash holdings do matter, but it&amp;#8217;s not&amp;nbsp;decisive.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, all the markets reversed their movement at the start of the week.
Commodities regained their momentum (up), equities too, mega stocks led the charge.
Bonds were relatively flat.
The more inflation shows up in the data, the more the market ignores it.
We&amp;#8217;ve had thirteen years of participants being trained to buy the dip, and there are no bears of risk-on assets left. At some point the consensus will break, but while central banks and governments are running lose monetary and fiscal policies, it is unlikely to happen.
To be fair, there is probably still a large output gap in most economies, so logically we can have a prolonged period of non-inflationary growth before we hit the buffers.

I think this is a well known result of the sort of process that leads to a power law distribution.

&lt;h2&gt;Markets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; markets are trading at or close to all-time highs. 
This is accounted for&amp;nbsp;by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unprecedented fiscal stimulus, including budget deficits of the sort that are barely seen in times of&amp;nbsp;war,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;repression of interest rates to the point that real returns on any sovereign credit is significantly&amp;nbsp;negative,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a very successful development of a vaccine and a strong recovery in economic activity after an artificial suppression of economic&amp;nbsp;activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that all these supporting factors are in the past. It&amp;#8217;s hard to see how they can be sustained or repeated.
At some point governments will have to raise taxes. Even the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; Mafia agree that taxes must be levied to drain liquidity once inflation starts to be felt. If 4.2% is not inflation, what is? If the time to increase taxes is not now, when is&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, today saw a strong reversal of the stock market falls of yesterday, dropping of yields, and reversing of the upward move in the dollar yesterday. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EUR&lt;/span&gt; was back where it was last November, at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;1.21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities were generally weak, dragged down by oil, down 3.5% by the close; maybe the restarting of the Colonial Pipeline had an&amp;nbsp;impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European shares were generally&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drivers of today&amp;#8217;s move presumably include, &lt;em&gt;inter alia&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Goldilocks inflation&amp;nbsp;targetting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://thesoundingline.com/the-wrong-kind-of-inflation-again/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is good article on why inflation targetting is much worse than trying to maintain a steady growth in the level of nominal &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;. 
Central banks may have to put on hold their mandates to solve racism, climate change and making life better for the alphabet mafia while they return to the boring problem of keeping the value of money&amp;nbsp;stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Bitcoin is rat poison&amp;nbsp;squared&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wallstreetonparade.com/2021/05/the-smartest-guys-in-the-room-call-bitcoin-rat-poison-squared-a-colossal-pump-and-dump-scheme-and-a-big-criminal-scam-but-federal-regulators-look/"&gt;Wall Street on Parade has a wonderful article about&amp;nbsp;bitcoin.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s amazing that the mainstream press simply won&amp;#8217;t say this stuff, because, hey, hey bitcoin is fintech, and it&amp;#8217;s self-evidently the saviour of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; economy, and we can&amp;#8217;t risk not getting advertising from the crypto ecosystem. We will see soon whether bitcoin really is the antidote to&amp;nbsp;inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harris also takes on the proposition that there is some intrinsic value to Bitcoin. He&amp;nbsp;writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It helps to understand that a bitcoin has no value at&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Promoters claim cryptocurrency is valuable as (1) a means of payment, (2) a store of value and/or (3) a thing in itself. None of these claims are&amp;nbsp;true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“1. Means of Payment. Bitcoins are accepted almost nowhere, and some cryptocurrencies nowhere at all. Even where accepted, a currency whose value can swing 10 percent or more in a single day is useless as a means of&amp;nbsp;payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“2. Store of Value. Extreme price volatility also makes bitcoin undesirable as a store of value. And the storehouses — the cryptocurrency trading exchanges — are far less reliable and trustworthy than ordinary banks and&amp;nbsp;brokers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“3. Thing in Itself. A bitcoin has no intrinsic value. It only has value if people think other people will buy it for a higher price — the Greater Fool&amp;nbsp;theory.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July 2019, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYU&lt;/span&gt; Professor and economist Nouriel Roubini launched a scathing analysis of Bitcoin. In a Bloomberg interview, Roubini said&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Crypto currencies are not even currencies. They’re a joke…The price of Bitcoin has fallen in a week by how much – 30 percent. It goes up 20 percent one day, collapses the next. It is not a means of payment, nobody, not even this blockchain conference, accepts Bitcoin for paying for conference fees cause you can do only five transactions per second with Bitcoin. With the Visa system you can do 25,000 transactions per second…Crypto’s nonsense. It’s a failure. Nobody’s using it for any transactions. It’s trading one sh&lt;em&gt;tcoin for another sh&lt;/em&gt;tcoin. That’s the entire trading or currency in the space where’s there’s price manipulation, spoofing, wash trading, pump and dumping, frontrunning. It’s just a big criminal scam and nothing&amp;nbsp;else.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the interview, Roubini added this: “There are millions of degenerate gamblers that are retail suckers, and they’re gonna create something where they can leverage not 10 times, not 50 times, but 100 times. It’s worse than those drug pushers who give you crack cocaine for free to get you addicted and then lead you to be&amp;nbsp;broke….”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lack of diversity is a problem for Fed Board of&amp;nbsp;Governors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, another article about inflation. Many commentators outside the mainstream have been saying this for a year or&amp;nbsp;more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it may surprise people to learn that not a single dissenting vote was cast by any member of the Fed’s Board of Governors throughout the eight monetary-policy meetings in 2020 and the three meetings held so far this year. The same is true for 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014, covering Mr. Powell’s years as Fed chairman and the entire term of his predecessor, Janet Yellen (2014-18). No Fed governor cast a dissenting vote from the Fed chair at any monetary policy meeting held throughout that&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At such meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee, which convene approximately every six weeks, monetary policy is determined by a group of Fed board members—seven governors by design, but fewer in recent years due to extended vacancies—and five of the 12 Reserve Bank presidents. The New York Fed president is a permanent &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOMC&lt;/span&gt; member, while four of the remaining 11 Reserve Bank presidents serve one-year terms on a rotating&amp;nbsp;basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn’t uncommon for Reserve Bank presidents to disagree formally with the policy actions approved by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOMC&lt;/span&gt;; their dissenting votes, based on compelling arguments, are contained in the minutes of those meetings. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOMC&lt;/span&gt; records indicate that dissents reflect fundamental differences between committee members over current policy and how to achieve macroeconomic objectives. That’s normal. What should give observers pause is the blanket agreement among Fed governors regarding the monetary-policy actions that get&amp;nbsp;implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following was copied from &lt;a href="https://thebearcave.substack.com/p/the-bear-cave-65-445"&gt;the latest Bear Cave newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;#8217;s well worth signing up to this weekly, free&amp;nbsp;service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Hwang reportedly grew assets in his family office from $200 million in 2013 to $20 billion in 2021. That’s 100x in eight years or a 78% annualized return after tax.&amp;nbsp;How?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix, one of Hwang’s best performing reported holdings, increased 35x from 2013 to 2021. Amazon increased 12x over the same time period. But those fall well short of Hwang’s reported returns. Hwang’s past returns at Tiger Asia don’t seem to fit the bill either. Tiger Asia reportedly annualized 16% around from its 2001 inception to its 2012 closing and reportedly annualized 40% during the bullish years of 2001 to&amp;nbsp;2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, after pleading guilty to illegal trading, losing access to some Asian markets, and losing access to some prime brokers, Hwang supposedly trounced his past performance and amassed a fortune greater than Steve Cohen and Julian Robertson combined, all without a whisper of&amp;nbsp;publicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the starting figure of $200 million is wrong, maybe Hwang successfully used serious leverage throughout all eight years, or maybe the ending $20 billion was not all Hwang’s own capital as some on Twitter have&amp;nbsp;theorized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hedging against interest rate&amp;nbsp;risk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;www.convexitymaven.com/images/Convexity_Maven_-_The_Helicopter_Defense.pdf&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this is a way to access interest rate hedging at a low&amp;nbsp;cost.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of ways of hedging against this risk, including eurodollar futures options, but this is probably cheaper and better.
Currently, it doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to be a problem, something that will continue until it&amp;nbsp;is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of anxiety surfacing about the 266K jobs report from last Friday.
The statistic is difficult to interpret because of various programmes which exist to support those who are not in employment. But with such a disappointing number, when there are still 16 M people unemployed makes people wonder how strong the recovery&amp;nbsp;is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities have been choppy for a couple of days. The markets are not synchronized, and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; did well today (about flat) because, presumably, investors reasoned that with a  weak jobs recovery, rates will stay lower for &amp;#8230; ever, thereby making growth stocks infinitely valuable. (Maybe.) This is borne out by the performance of gold, which was flat, consistent with no growth. Crude was up modestly (0.5%), but food was up quite a lot: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SB&lt;/span&gt; futures (&amp;#8216;Sugar No. 11&amp;#8217;) was up&amp;nbsp;3.6%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds were in line: 10Y flat, and currencies ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt;) the&amp;nbsp;same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, quoted land exposure ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAND&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FPI&lt;/span&gt;) were down heavily. These are not really a proxy for land, they are rather niche farm leasing companies.
A better exposure is probably achieved via a fertilizer stock, like $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;YAR&lt;/span&gt; or $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MOS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARKK&lt;/span&gt; and loss making tech stocks are struggling generally, although $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARKK&lt;/span&gt; was up 2% today, presumably bounce after the steep declines of&amp;nbsp;yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Info Tech is just a very long-duration fixed rate&amp;nbsp;bond&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Well, that's what it looks like!" src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F78c01a12-8325-4313-aa93-74209a29ab52_500x283.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; 10Y up to&amp;nbsp;1.61%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; up approx 0.15% vs &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EUR&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPY&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; (May future) up 5.7% to&amp;nbsp;19.3%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;commodities start to wobble. Lumber down 3.8%, but after an insane run, metals strong, oil complex&amp;nbsp;flat,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; down 2%, many of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; more than that. Rising yields are kryptonite for growth&amp;nbsp;stocks. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of stocks had big&amp;nbsp;moves:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Filo Mining ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FIL&lt;/span&gt;) was up&amp;nbsp;10%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peabody Coal ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTU&lt;/span&gt;) was up&amp;nbsp;15.8%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My instinct is that fossil fuels have hit a bottom. As &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESG&lt;/span&gt; funds starve them of capital, the returns will increase. 
Coal is still responsible for 70% of all electricity generation throughout the world. 
A coal or natural gas power plant has huge advantages over renewable power, in terms of capital costs and speed of build and flexibility.
In the West, we may be able to afford windfarms, but in the developing world, they just don&amp;#8217;t have the time or the money.
I know this is an unpopular view, but making money in the markets is about understanding what is going to happen, not what should&amp;nbsp;happen.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Money and inflation</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/money-and-inflation.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-05-07T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:56+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-05-07:/money-and-inflation.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Thought for the&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest news for today was a miss in new jobs numbers for April. The number was 266K, which would normally be good, but compared to the 770K which were created (net) in March, this is pretty disappointing. Unemployment hit 6.1%, hardly evidence of an overheating economy. 
Rather surprisingly, bonds held steady: 10Y was at 1.58%. Technically 2bp higher yield. German and Jap yields remained precisely flat.
Commodities are roaring away: iron ore was up 5.35%. Copper up 2.9%. Food and hydrocarbons were up, but much more modestly.
There is some indication of pressure on yields in the Eurodollar market. Read chartpoint.com for&amp;nbsp;colour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Politics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conservatives seem to have done unexpectedly well in the elections yesterday.
I wish I understood why ordinary voters vote the way they do. 
I have spent a huge amount of time thinking about economics and politics, and I feel I have lost my gut feel for what is good politics.
David &amp;#8220;Two Brains&amp;#8221; Willetts used to say that it was important that the Conservatives did not become the &amp;#8216;economics party.&amp;#8217; 
I guess he was pointing out the fact that people frequently choose to vote for policies that make them objectively worse off. 
One can argue about whether an economist&amp;#8217;s estimate of welfare effects fully captures the feeling of smugness at having been on the winning side of the vote in a referendum. 
The last successful &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt; who had a rigorous economics training was Harold Wilson. One could probably argue that the policies of his party were much more shaped by the views of his cabinet than would be the case in any subsequent &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt; and as such reflected a composite, largely non-economic&amp;nbsp;viewpoint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the full picture will not emerge until next week. One of the biggest issues is the independence of Scotland. This is something I find about as interesting as the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schleswig-Holstein_Question"&gt;Schleswig-Holstein Question&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Mervyn King thinks we may be heading for inflation</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/mervyn-king-thinks-we-may-be-heading-for-inflation.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-05-06T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:56+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-05-06:/mervyn-king-thinks-we-may-be-heading-for-inflation.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Thoughts of the&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Capitalisn&amp;#8217;t has Lord King as&amp;nbsp;guest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.capitalisnt.com/episodes/worried-about-inflation-so-is-fmr-central-banker-mervyn-king"&gt;Lord King is worried.&lt;/a&gt;
It&amp;#8217;s always worth listening to Luigi Zingales, ditto Mervyn King. 
When they are talking to each other, it&amp;#8217;s a can&amp;#8217;t-miss event.
King is both a great economist, and a former central banker.
He is a user of models, but someone who has thought deeply about their limitations. 
There is a lot to absorb, but one of his points is that the explosion of high powered money in the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 was not accompanied by an explosion in the broad money supply (roughly speaking, the money created by the actions of private banks lending).
He points out that the explosion of high powered money now has been accompanied by an explosion in M4 etc.
He is quite worried about central banks saying that we should not worry about inflation running above trend for a year or so because we can always tighten monetary policy and bring it down. 
As he points out, we&amp;#8217;ve had a decade or two of failing to make inflation high enough using monetary policy, so it&amp;#8217;s the height of arrogance to think that we can control it perfectly on the up side. 
As he says, by not anchoring expectations, and by an unwillingness of politicians to do anything short term that might create a recession, 
the most likely outcome is a much bigger depression further down the&amp;nbsp;tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, it&amp;#8217;s not that King is expressing these fairly mainstream opinions (maybe ones not officially shared by in-post central bankers), it&amp;#8217;s that he doesn&amp;#8217;t think that the fears are unfounded. 
This has not shown up much in bond prices yet, but surely it&amp;nbsp;will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ponzi sector is seeing some big&amp;nbsp;falls:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yell Corp ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;YELL&lt;/span&gt;) down&amp;nbsp;33%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETSY&lt;/span&gt; down&amp;nbsp;16.5%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROKU&lt;/span&gt; down&amp;nbsp;9.5%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TWLO&lt;/span&gt; down&amp;nbsp;10%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNOW&lt;/span&gt; down&amp;nbsp;10%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are volatile stocks. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARKK&lt;/span&gt; is only down 3%, but it&amp;#8217;s looking&amp;nbsp;vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; equity markets were up, by about&amp;nbsp;0.8%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds were&amp;nbsp;flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currencies pretty flat (Euro up&amp;nbsp;0.5%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rohangrey"&gt;Rohan Grey&lt;/a&gt; gave an interesting podcast interview that was relayed onto &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MMTpodcast"&gt;the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; podcast&lt;/a&gt;. 
I know opinions vary a lot about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt;, but it&amp;#8217;s interesting to hear him talk in almost Gramscian terms about having to infiltrate institutions, helping them put on events, producing materials for them to present as their own, in order to get &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; into the mainstream of economic thought. 
He was very interesting in his chat about the reaction to the mother of his ex-gf, who was a member of congress, to his statements about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt;. She said, allegedly &amp;#8220;I can&amp;#8217;t say that.&amp;#8221; The point is that she reacted as a politician, and expressed the view that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8216;conclusions&amp;#8217; are simply unsayable by someone who wants to be treated as an electable politician. This is the famous &amp;#8216;Overton Window&amp;#8217; being not yet over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt;. 
It&amp;#8217;s odd, in that Democrat policies seem pretty much &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt;, but with a pretence of being able to balance the budget&amp;nbsp;eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d like to write something about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt;, but this is not the place. It is an idea whose time is not yet come, but in time (like Monetarism) it may become an article of faith which divides the Right from the&amp;nbsp;Left.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>SPACs down, coal miners up</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/spacs-down-coal-miners-up.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-05-05T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:56+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-05-05:/spacs-down-coal-miners-up.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;The day in&amp;nbsp;review&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairly flat day, except that European equity markets seem to be catching up with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; ones.
Commodities fairly mixed, food and gold doing best.
Bonds slightly deflationary: 10Y yield now at 1.57%.
Tech monopoly shares ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;APPL&lt;/span&gt; etc.) looking fairly tired.
Some coal stocks doing very well: $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HNRG&lt;/span&gt; is now up 250% over the year, 13% for the day. This indicates that King Coal has not yet handed in his orb and&amp;nbsp;sceptre. &lt;/p&gt;

Krugman has argued that because predictions twenty years ago were very pessimistic, the current pessimistic predictions are wrong too, in the same direction.

&lt;h2&gt;Corporate&amp;nbsp;taxation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biden is jacking up corporation tax rates. Rates jump all over the place, without any systematic impact on stock prices, which is odd. 
Robert Armstrong wrote &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/234c24c8-785d-4663-93d2-2d2794f3bdf9"&gt;a good piece about this&lt;/a&gt;. 
[We should tax economic rents. Maybe corp. profits are rents. Maybe big tech has rents, but the rest? Maybe corp. taxes reduce private&amp;nbsp;investment.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chinese&amp;nbsp;Credit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thesoundingline.com/leland-miller-borrowing-from-chinese-state-backed-firms-shrinks-most-of-record/"&gt;Leland Miller: Borrowing from Chinese State Owned Firms Shrinks Most on Record&lt;/a&gt;.
This is a post from The Sounding Line. It points out how while money creation in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; is growing at a huge pace, China is trying to de-leverage its notoriously over-leveraged economy. 
Deleveraging is always the tricky thing to do as a central banker. Which is, I guess, why they all want to put it off until it becomes a problem for the next board. 
The added complication is that it&amp;#8217;s hard to see how the PBoC can keep the exchange rate stable against the dollar. 
I am not a massive dollar bear, but it&amp;#8217;s hard to see how anyone can stop the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; strengthening against the dollar. 
And as the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; goes up, the currencies of all &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASEAN&lt;/span&gt; countries are going to have to rise, since their economies are so tightly coupled with that of&amp;nbsp;China&amp;#8217;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably not going to happen for a while, as the dollar (and dollar assets like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasuries) retains its safe haven appeal, but after the risk of another seizure of the world economy goes away, this must surely the way things will&amp;nbsp;go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reflation trade rides again!
Markets spooked for some unknown reason. 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; down 2%. It is up 5% &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YTD&lt;/span&gt;, but in a market which is going bananas, this is not impressive.
The gains from the &amp;#8220;lockdown trade&amp;#8221; of buying $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFLX&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PTON&lt;/span&gt; seem to be gone.
Bonds were pretty flat.
The dollar was up, 0.4% at 91.3. 
The only news which might explain this was that Janet Yellen conceded that if the economy overheats, interest rates might have to go up.
I would have thought that this was a statement of the blindingly obvious, but it shows how twitchy this market is.
The dog that did not bark was gold: it was down 0.8%.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSCI&lt;/span&gt; commodities index was up ~1%, but this just reflects the heavy weighting of oil in this index. 
Oil was up&amp;nbsp;2%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be worth looking at the work of Chase Taylor at Pinecone Macro. He is a terrific contrarian and explains why hydrocarbons will be the mainstay of energy production in the world for the next&amp;nbsp;decade.&lt;/p&gt;

I think the guy is great, and his sidekick Charlie Munger even greater, but they are both way, way past their &amp;#8216;best before&amp;#8217; date.
I think the stock probably is a buy, because when one or other of these guys kicks the bucket, the conglomerate will be broken up and this will produce a huge re-rating of the shares.
That&amp;#8217;s not an original idea of mine. Warren said it himself, decades&amp;nbsp;ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems pretty icky taking a position that will benefit from someone&amp;#8217;s death, but let&amp;#8217;s face it, anyone who owns a stock with  pension liabilities is doing the same.
The problem is, as McKenna points out, that Warren has been buying stuff at inflated prices lately.
He&amp;#8217;s invested in Apple, and gold miners, and various things that do not add value to the investor.
If I want to want to own these things, it&amp;#8217;s easy for me to do so.
It seems odd that a guy so knowledgeable about the markets does this kind of thing.
It&amp;#8217;s the same as fElon buying&amp;nbsp;bitcoin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I don&amp;#8217;t have a position, but the post is an interesting read, and it&amp;#8217;s probably worth setting up an alert to be informed about Warren&amp;#8217;s state of&amp;nbsp;health.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s not convertible, and India is a very closed economy, but it is big enough that even the modest links to the rest of the world&amp;#8217;s economy might tip a few others over the edge.
The fragile five are India, Indonesia, South Africa, Mexico &amp;amp;Brazil. Some big&amp;nbsp;names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not just your imagination. Commodities are on&amp;nbsp;fire&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sentimentrader.com/blog/commodities-havent-done-this-in-50-years/"&gt;Sentiment Trader says so.&lt;/a&gt;
The question is: how long can this bull trend run, and will gold finally join in with the&amp;nbsp;fun?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Child care&amp;nbsp;industry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-child-care-industry-was-collapsing-mrs-jackie-bet-everything-on-an-impossible-dream-to-save-it"&gt;Propublica article&lt;/a&gt; explains why it&amp;#8217;s so tough to make childcare work.
It&amp;#8217;s hard work to look after kids, but it&amp;#8217;s also a highly regulated industry.
Barriers to entry, for unregulated substitutes for daycare centres are practically non-existent.
The tax wedge between a formal arrangement and an informal one is huge, especially if the provider is receiving means-tested benefits.
The professionals who draft the rules have almost certainly never worked in minimum wage jobs and have no concept of the challenges that those without their advantages face.
So, in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, childcare is a bad experience for customer and&amp;nbsp;worker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;European&amp;nbsp;Value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://mailchi.mp/verdadcap/the-next-decade-in-european-value"&gt;Verdad thinks European markets are value plays.&lt;/a&gt;
I&amp;#8217;ve been of this opinion for a while. Russia perpetually disappoints, but has a lot of energy and minerals.
This is supported by the analysis in &lt;a href="https://thesoundingline.com/chart-commodity-bull-market-just-getting-started/"&gt;a post by Taps Coogan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="here" src="https://thesoundingline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/commodity-10-years-rolling-returns-positive-for-first-time-since-2014.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Queen&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;Speech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speech is not actually written by the queen. It&amp;#8217;s full of buzzwords, and she almost certainly weeps over the grammar and syntax.
It is usually couched in vague, imprecise terms, with an emphasis on making lots of things better than they were without any metrics, and without explaining how diverting resources will avoid making other things worse.
But this month&amp;#8217;s speech contains a lot of bills promised in the manifesto, including a new planning bill.
I read the white paper on planning. 
You can read about it &lt;a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-8981/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
The legislation is very good on what is wrong, and is not about about what must be done to put it right.
But there are so many vested interests in keeping it wrong, I&amp;#8217;d give it a 1% chance of not being totally hobbled by the time it comes to its second reading. A lot of the economy of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; is dependent on creating large economic rents from the artificial scarcity of development land created by the planning process. It&amp;#8217;s really very hard to see how the govt. can buy off that interest in order to get some sensible legislation through. This is not a party political point: Labour never did anything about this, even though fixing planning would be hugely effective in reducing&amp;nbsp;inequality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of Europe was shut, because it&amp;#8217;s Labour Day.
European equity markets were strong, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; ones less so.
Oddly, bonds were flat, but &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; did much worse than &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt;, with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSP&lt;/span&gt; (equal-weighted &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SP500&lt;/span&gt;) doing best of all.
There were weak performances put in by SPACs. I don&amp;#8217;t know why, but most most comment I&amp;#8217;ve seen barely conceals it&amp;#8217;s contempt for the craze. 
The dollar seems to resumed its downward&amp;nbsp;trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Taxing the&amp;nbsp;rich&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krugman has a post on &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/30/opinion/tax-cuts-rich.html"&gt;taxing the rich&lt;/a&gt;.
It makes the point that it&amp;#8217;s very unlikely that a tax increase for the very rich will make them work less.
I has a great chart of income against cumulative distribution. It&amp;#8217;s almost a perfectly straight line, when plotted as a log-log graph.
A vast number of relationships in physics have a log-log relationship, but few things in social sciences are so&amp;nbsp;quantitative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="5ba9c628ccfe3f559dd11cf4a4b00292.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/5ba9c628ccfe3f559dd11cf4a4b00292.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been vaguely aware that a Pareto distribution arises from an exponential growth rate of wealth in a population with a distribution of investment horizons. 
&lt;a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.29.1.29"&gt;This paper&lt;/a&gt; gives some details, and some pointers to a more rigorous explanation of how the distribution&amp;nbsp;arises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krugman&amp;#8217;s post is designed to stiffen the spine of Biden in his announced policy of increasing taxation of capital.
I have been very surprised at the speed and efficience of Biden in getting bills through parliament. 
I read today that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Klain"&gt;Ron Klain&lt;/a&gt; is the power behind the throne. 
The article is in the Sunday Times, and behind a paywall. It asserts that Biden wants to leave a legacy so he is remembered alongside &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FDR&lt;/span&gt;. 
Probably alongside Reagan too, but maybe he didn&amp;#8217;t want to say the name.
Anyway, he seems to be going about the job in an effective way.
I suspect that all the presidents who are remembered fondly actually did much more harm than good, but big programmes like the New Deal and the Great Society always get a pass, because the harm they did often comes later, or is never connected closely to the programme. 
An impairment of potential growth of 0.5% doesn&amp;#8217;t sound much, but over decades produces a big cumulative shortfall of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bison&amp;nbsp;Recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bison Interests (formerly Bison Energy) is a great firm with a free montly newsletter. Sign up &lt;a href="https://bisoninterests.com"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
They are bullish on oil, and recommending $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSX&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTE&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baytex Energy (&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BTEGF?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link" title="Baytex Energy Corp."&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OTCPK&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTEGF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) is a cheap, levered oil stock, with assets in the Eagle Ford and heavy and light unconventional Canadian oil resource plays. The stock has upside to $2.50 from here, almost a double, just from trading up in line with comps at $60 oil. As oil rises, Baytex&amp;#8217;s financial leverage and large development inventory provides substantial upside &amp;#8220;torque&amp;#8221;. And Baytex just discovered oil, in a discovery that may be worth 15-50% of its current market cap and has not yet been press released. There is upside to $10-15 per share, from recent levels of $1.30-1.40. All numbers in Canadian&amp;nbsp;dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure they made sure their own buy orders were filled before sending this out, but the thesis looks worth further investigation. The stock does not seem to have moved yet.
Micro cap companies are notorious for price manipulation and misleading filings, so take professional advice before investing a dime etc.&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fertilizer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a huge spike in the price of food commodities, which may or may not be down to the very active fiscal policies being pursued by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury and elsewhere.
The impact may already be in the price of soybeans, but I think there may be upside in fertilizer companies.
Three interesting plays are Yara ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSE&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;YAR&lt;/span&gt;), Mosiac ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYSE&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MOS&lt;/span&gt;) and Nutrien ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSX&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NTR&lt;/span&gt;). 
Yara is the most conservatively managed, but might be the safest bet.
There is a good, recent review of the sector &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-150-billion-chemical-fertilizers-084300330.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/5240331/chemical-fertilizers-global-market-report-2021"&gt;Research and Markets&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://corporate.nordea.com/article/65222/fomc-review-the-labour-market-is-now-the-only-thing-worth-watching"&gt;Nordea have written another excellent piece of research&lt;/a&gt;. They point out that inflation expectations have rarely been&amp;nbsp;higher.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s another example of inflation pressures&amp;nbsp;building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oil production&amp;nbsp;capped&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Reflexivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FabiusMercurius/status/1387540429520793600"&gt;this great thread&lt;/a&gt; on reflexivity, George Soros&amp;#8217;s contribution to investing lore.
I have read his book on it a couple of times, and at the end of it I&amp;#8217;ve always&amp;nbsp;thought:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wow, is that all there is to&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;so, demand …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;The day in&amp;nbsp;retrospect&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reflexivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FabiusMercurius/status/1387540429520793600"&gt;this great thread&lt;/a&gt; on reflexivity, George Soros&amp;#8217;s contribution to investing lore.
I have read his book on it a couple of times, and at the end of it I&amp;#8217;ve always&amp;nbsp;thought:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wow, is that all there is to&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;so, demand for a security might even go up as the price increases. I can get that, but it won&amp;#8217;t go on forever, right, because otherwise the stock market would just be all $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, so regular demand supply curves aren&amp;#8217;t exactly quantitative, but the only thing that matters for trading is when a trend reverses, and Soros doesn&amp;#8217;t really say anything about how to stop&amp;nbsp;this,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;umm, technical analysts, chartists and astrologers have chanted mystical incantations over lines on price history plots, and asserted that certain trends would continue/reverse/other for a long time, and yet there are no billionaire chartists that I am aware&amp;nbsp;of,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is probably something in this, but it&amp;#8217;s not clear how to profit from it other than to be aware of the possibility that trends can continue for a long&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="2af8e0f704a8677398bc11902940f75b.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/2af8e0f704a8677398bc11902940f75b.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example of the operation of reflexivity is as&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FabiusMercurius/status/1387545537595863042?s=20"&gt;3rd example: Asimovians dream of electric sheep&amp;#8212;er, cars&amp;#8212; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; goes up; enters S&amp;amp;P 500, gets added into index funds and robo advisors; robot buyers hike the stonk; millions of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;-fawning Chinese parvenus adopt it as their new status symbol; stonk go&amp;nbsp;up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;#8217;m still not totally won over, but I sort of see the point better now than after reading a whole book, so I thought I&amp;#8217;d share&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must confess, my understanding after reading the book was that this was purely a &amp;#8220;technical&amp;#8221; effect: that the rising price trend dragged more buyers into the market as they became more convinced that the security had been previously&amp;nbsp;mispriced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The administrative&amp;nbsp;state&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wallstreetonparade.com/2021/04/secs-gary-gensler-picks-a-20-year-wall-street-bank-defender-for-his-crime-chief/"&gt;Yes, Alex Young K. Oh was a former federal prosecutor, but one of numerous assistant &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; Attorneys working in the Southern District of New York more than two decades ago. What Oh has been doing for the past two decades is working as an attorney for Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Garrison, the law firm that major Wall Street banks repeatedly choose [to fight their serial fraud charges](https://bettermarkets.com/sites/default/files/Better%20Markets%20-%20Wall%20Street%27s%20Six%20Biggest%20Bailed-Out%20Banks%&lt;span class="caps"&gt;20FINAL&lt;/span&gt;.pdf).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really don&amp;#8217;t know much about the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEC&lt;/span&gt;, but I assume if what the Martens write was factually wrong, they&amp;#8217;d be sued to Kingdom Come, given that they regularly attack lawyers and very well connected individuals. I never see this stuff in the mainstream media. Either they think it&amp;#8217;s not worth reporting, or that it&amp;#8217;s better than ordinary people do not learn about these goings&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; down to 90.56 on a steep&amp;nbsp;downtrend. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, fairly reflationary and slightly risk on. No strong&amp;nbsp;trends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The end of&amp;nbsp;neo-liberalism?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that with the election of Biden the small government ideas of Hayek, Friedman, Reagan and Thatcher might be falling out of favour, after four decades in the ascendant.
The religion of neoliberalism is more worshiped in the breach than the observance, but it had set the tone of governments promising fiscal continence even if they failed to deliver it in practice.
With the huge stimulus spending to combat Covid-19, the idea that government spending was a terrible thing has quietly faded away, just as it did in the years after &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WWII&lt;/span&gt;. 
Unfortunately, when the pendulum swings, it usually goes too far, and we are likely to see the return of wage inflation and price inflation and, maybe even, at some point, defaults on government debt either explicit or via financial&amp;nbsp;repression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1981, this was done by ideologues. In 2021 this will be done by pragmatists who realize that returns to capital have got out of line with returns to other factors of production. 
I am not sure whether this means that the right wing parties will lose out, or they will just steal the clothing of the left wing. 
I think it&amp;#8217;s more likely to be the latter, since the Right  would rather lose their principles than their elections.

&lt;h2&gt;The old order changeth … when&amp;nbsp;exactly?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The old order changeth … when&amp;nbsp;exactly?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packy McCormick writes a cracking blog. &lt;a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/who-disrupts-the-disrupters"&gt;His latest post&lt;/a&gt; is about trying to imagine what will push Facebook, Google, Amazon et al. off their place at the top of the pyramid.
He points out that the economics of their services are different. 
Not only are they natural monopolies in the sense that their marginal costs do not start to go up before they satisfy all demand, but that their marginal cost is simply zero at all scales. This makes the traditional strategy for a disruptor, where they pick off a small segment and establish a bridgehead, unviable.
He goes on to make the point that they control the ultimate scarce resource: access to the teeming mass of original content providers.
Think of Spotify: to buy all the albums you have access to with a subscription would cost $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;100MM&lt;/span&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s yours for $10 a month. 
Spotify controls that toll bridge, and can charge a modest fee for something valuable but unobtaintable&amp;nbsp;otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He asks us to think what the disruptors will look like, to imagine ourselves as a local newspaper owner in 1995 wondering about Craig&amp;#8217;s List.
Well, his prediction is that Web3, blockchain, and disintermediation will do the trick.
For what it&amp;#8217;s worth, I think that I&amp;#8217;ve read too many predictions of the end of intermediation over the years to be wholly convinced.
I think there is golden opportunity for someone to set up a micropayments system to allow consumers of content to transact directly with producers.
But as Ronald Coase explained, the sort of combinatorial explosion of contracts would be extremely costly. Hence the existence of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FB&lt;/span&gt; as a sort of clearing house for&amp;nbsp;advertising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The likes of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FB&lt;/span&gt; grow in value very rapidly with numbers of members, typically as the square as the membership size, which relates to the number of pairs.
Payments systems are tricky to run.
Blockchain has failed in bring down transaction costs (relative to Western Union, let alone Visa).  It seems to me that the price of decentralizing the recording of transactions is too high. I don&amp;#8217;t know what the answer is: maybe central bank digital currencies will come to the&amp;nbsp;rescue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there is clearly a need to escape the transaction toll bridges erected by eBay, Spotify, Facebook, Google etc. I think that these monopolies are very unhealthy for society, both economically and politically, but I can&amp;#8217;t believe that blockchain will be the key to the&amp;nbsp;breakup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Buffett indicator hits &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that is the Buffet indicator. Currently it is trading 88% higher than the long term trend line according to currenmarketvaluation.com.
 This is definitely nothing for the short term trader to watch, and this time is &amp;#8220;different&amp;#8221; as rates remain at historically low levels, but it is still worth having the chart in the back of your head as Fed continues &amp;#8220;forcing&amp;#8221; everyone into long&amp;nbsp;equities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="83160fbdaff29ab6bed7495c3b25f1d1.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/83160fbdaff29ab6bed7495c3b25f1d1.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;European&amp;nbsp;Energy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen commodity index, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BCOM&lt;/span&gt;, continue the latest&amp;nbsp;surge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil has lagged this move and the gap vs commodities is wide here. Momentum chasers continue chasing momentum, but we would not be surprised if people started chasing some laggards soon, think&amp;nbsp;oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest energy laggards is the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; energy sector. So, we have oil under performing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BCOM&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; energy under performing oil big&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GS&lt;/span&gt; the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; energy sector trades at a historical discount to the&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time upside in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SXEP&lt;/span&gt; is very well bid. The 1 month 25 delta call skew trades at elevated&amp;nbsp;levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this&amp;nbsp;mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are basically paying up big time for upside call options in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SXEP&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; energy offers interesting risk/reward from a &amp;#8220;catch up&amp;#8221;/value play, and given the steep upside skew pricing of options, you could play the upside&amp;nbsp;with;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;simple upside call spreads where you end up selling the relatively more expensive upside in terms of&amp;nbsp;vol&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;covered calls, where you sell the elevated vol in the upside call logic, but obviously this one has you &amp;#8220;naked&amp;#8221; (long stock) to the downside as you have practically sold a&amp;nbsp;put.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The above logic is valid for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XLE&lt;/span&gt; as well, although the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XLE&lt;/span&gt; has performed better relative to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SXEP&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(From The Market&amp;nbsp;Ear)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSX&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Fraud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone knew that $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSX&lt;/span&gt; was a fraud, but it made sense to hold&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://wallstreetonparade.com/2021/04/mega-banks-on-wall-street-held-3-billion-in-archegos-related-gsx-techedu-months-after-numerous-short-sellers-wrote-that-it-was-a-fraud/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Financial&amp;nbsp;Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By all measures, financial conditions are as easy as they have ever been.
Most asset prices are hitting all time highs. Real assets, and highly speculative digital and virtual ones. Ponzi stocks are on a tear. Where will it end? Nobody knows, but there has to be a small chance that it will end spectacularly&amp;nbsp;badly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fed, via J Powell, the chairman, stated that it will leave the target for Fed funds unchanged, and it will continue to buy $120B of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasuries per month. So, no change in policy. In response equity and bond markets remained&amp;nbsp;calm:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Deluard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vincent Deluard of Stonex is always worth listening to on The Market Huddle.
He was on last week arguing&amp;nbsp;that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China and satellites suppressed their currencies in the 90&amp;#8217;s to keep their large young populations&amp;nbsp;employed,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China imposed capital controls to prevent the sort of situation which occured in Japan in the 80s, which resulted in decades of&amp;nbsp;pain,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;these trends will reverse in the coming decade, resulting in Chinese assets, and currency appreciating, to allow the retirees to spend in their&amp;nbsp;dotage,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is essentially the &amp;#8216;Great Moderation&amp;#8217; run in reverse, with 1bn productive young workers taken out of the global labour&amp;nbsp;force,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the loss cheap productive capacity will result in&amp;nbsp;inflation,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;East Asian assets, of all sorts will go up (but watch out for equities, and China&amp;nbsp;repression),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this inflation will spread to the&amp;nbsp;West,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LTAM&lt;/span&gt; assets will be worth looking at as they are long real and short dollar exposure: e.g. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BRL&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLP&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A stock I&amp;#8217;ve liked for a while is $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TPL&lt;/span&gt;, Texas Pacific Land. Do your own research, but this owns a big chunk of land in Texas, arising from some railway concession.
Land stocks like $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FPI&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAND&lt;/span&gt; have been doing well, following the renewed interest in agricultural commodities. Take a look at $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DBA&lt;/span&gt;.
This all feeds into the inflation&amp;nbsp;narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Golden age for&amp;nbsp;macro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to Vincent Deluard on the Market Huddle podcast.
He was talking about the golden age of macro. His thesis seemed to be that countries are rapidly reaching the point where Mundell&amp;#8217;s trilemma (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trilemma.asp) will start to bite and they&amp;#8217;ll have to make the decision between running monetary policy to keep their domestic economy stable or their exchange rate stable. They cannot contemplate imposing capital controls, and so they have never been entirely free to set their monetary policy and exchange rate independently, but positive interest rates have given them scope to balance the two to arrive at relatively stable exchange rates and monetary policy that is not disastrously bad.
(I know that plenty of people would disagree with that, but park that thought.) Now the developed world is reaching the zero lower bound, the exchange rate is going to have to take the strain. The sheer arithmetic of financing cost to public and private sectors means that we can never go back to positive interest&amp;nbsp;rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone said, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; idea is that you can monetize debt until you start to see inflation, then you can steadily increase taxes until it goes away again.
In a democracy, that simply is not going to happen. Taxes cannot go up, and spending cannot go down in a country where a government depends on free and fair elections to get back into&amp;nbsp;power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theethicalskeptic.com/"&gt;The Ethical Skeptic&lt;/a&gt; is a former intelligence officer who has a wide range of interests and a rigorous approach to understanding the world.
I came across him on Twitter through his analysis of pandemic statistics. 
He is a remarkable erudite individual. I discovered his long-form writing recently and read 
&lt;a href="https://theethicalskeptic.com/2021/02/24/the-peculiar-schema-of-dna-codons-second-letter/"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; on the evolution of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt;.
I have a couple of degrees in chemistry, and I have spent many decades writing software.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; is where these two disciplines meet. 
But the article went well beyond my understanding of the subject. 
I was relieved to read that when Skeptic took the ideas to a professor of genetics, these ideas were new to&amp;nbsp;him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to read the article again, but it reopened the question of why it is that all living things follow the same template so closely, and that all living things are so alike.
Humans and slime moulds are, from a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; point of view, 85% the same. 
I made up the stat, but it can&amp;#8217;t be far&amp;nbsp;off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know enough about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; coding of proteins to understand the argument, but he seems to be saying that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; has been around since practically the beginning of time, at least as far as the Earth is concerned. Although I know that the base pairs form a very stable structure, and that there is a very neat mapping from codons to proteins, I have no idea what alternative arrangements of thymine, adenine, guanine and cytosine are stereochemically possible, whether other bases could be substituted, or why exactly 23 amino acids are optimal for building proteins and&amp;nbsp;polypeptides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admire individuals who want to be known for their work, not for themselves. The other famous example is Satoshi Nakamoto.

He&amp;#8217;s cautious and nuanced, but I think the basic thesis might be sound. 
In an ideal world, I think it would be good to hedge away part of the crypto correlation risk, by maybe shorting some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt;, but that&amp;#8217;s tricky, given how volatile the stuff&amp;nbsp;is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;And the 2021 risk management innovation award goes to … Credit&amp;nbsp;Suisse!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost unbelievable, but&amp;nbsp;true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the risk innovation of the year (believe it or not) goes to Credit&amp;nbsp;Suisse&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a great irony&amp;nbsp;reading;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Risk Awards 2021: new analytics dash helped bank get ahead of op risk breaches during Covid&amp;nbsp;crisis&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few excerpts from the Risk.net article from February is almost a parody given what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CS&lt;/span&gt; has experienced over past weeks (full article&amp;nbsp;here);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8230;based on monitoring controls in real time, and reducing the lag in responding to and shutting down operational incidents before they turn into potential loss&amp;nbsp;events.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;You had individuals at every level of the organisation – our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt;, our executive board, our board of directors – all wanting real-time information throughout the course of that. This tool allowed us to pull that together very quickly – and that was only because we built it in such a way that it could leverage those analytic capabilities and the [underlying] data&amp;nbsp;platforms,&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;They were able to zone down to a specific desk,” adds Barkley. “In some cases, they had calls two to three times a day to determine how those controls were&amp;nbsp;doing.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk management is a complex area of finance and trading. Most banks have sophisticated models to monitor risk, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; system (the new risk dashboard) is probably great, but the problem with the Archegos position has little to do with identifying the risks, but is all about how you manage the risk&amp;nbsp;practically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do not need advanced models to monitor risks like the Archegos exposure was. For that you need a simple excel sheet that anybody can follow. The problem arises when you do not act in&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of the Archegos risk as basically somebody &amp;#8220;booking in&amp;#8221; a few huge trades in your book and you need to manage that&amp;nbsp;position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anybody that has worked at/run a prop/market making desk knows you need to take of this risk asap. You can have all the correlation models you want, but when somebody hits you in size in names like the &amp;#8220;Hwang basket&amp;#8221; you need to act immediately. This has nothing to do with failed risk management systems, but the lack of taking&amp;nbsp;action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, you suddenly realize this stuff is illiquid, and what most people tend to do is to start hoping for the bounce instead mechanically exiting the&amp;nbsp;position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stop loss hurts, but that is the definition of the stop loss. Holding the position and hoping for a bounce is not risk management, especially as you already identified the&amp;nbsp;risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will probably never get the full picture of what happened at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CS&lt;/span&gt;, but we would not be surprised if part of the strategy was &amp;#8220;let the stocks bounce and we will sell some&amp;#8221;. Nobody believed that the Hwang basket could implode the way it did, but that is beside the&amp;nbsp;point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real risk management requires action and not&amp;nbsp;hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically the risk award to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CS&lt;/span&gt; was probably a good pick, but if you have models people don&amp;#8217;t follow, you will end up in trouble sooner or&amp;nbsp;later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you need to keep it simple, in risk management as well. We have shown the table a few times, but people tend to overlook the most basic principle of risk management and focus on fancy models&amp;nbsp;instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to lose 50%, but it is very hard to make &amp;#8220;back&amp;#8221; the 100% needed to break&amp;nbsp;even…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shamelessly copied from The Market&amp;nbsp;Ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Highest valued startups in the&amp;nbsp;world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="4c12f16f1a8b3ae021f6738cd86a25bd.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/4c12f16f1a8b3ae021f6738cd86a25bd.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well &amp;#8220;valued&amp;#8221; is a loaded term. Someone bought a share, and the price of that share was multiplied by the total number of allocated and issued shares of the company concerned. 
It&amp;#8217;s not as though anyone would pay these sums for the equity of these companies .…&amp;nbsp;surely!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Capital Gains&amp;nbsp;games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The equalizing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CGT&lt;/span&gt; rates with income tax rates is something that was done in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; in the 1980s. By a free market chancellor, who was part of a right wing government. Nobody thought it was too bad, as far as I can recall. 
It&amp;#8217;s so easy to convert income to capital gains (invoice through a company and sell shares in the cash shell at par), that it just seems the right&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Taxation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pro.creditwritedowns.com/p/tax-and-spend-crony-capitalism-and"&gt;Read this post about taxation&lt;/a&gt; by Edward&amp;nbsp;Harrison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s about the &amp;#8220;tax grab&amp;#8221; proposed by Biden.
It gives an historical perspective, showing that the highest marginal rate of tax between about 1943 and 1963 was around 90%. 
Harrison, quoting a Michael Hudson, explains that the reason was … Henry&amp;nbsp;George!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says the original premise of the income tax law was based on 18th and 19th century classical economics and the price theory of economic rent. First and foremost, Hudson says that meant to the economists of the late 19th century and early 20th century that America would get rich through productivity gains that came from the work of highly paid labour. …
However, to the degree one made considerably more than the average income, Hudson argues it was assumed in the early 20th century that this was the result of rent-seeking or monopoly privilege of the sort we saw during feudalism. Therefore this income was largely taxed&amp;nbsp;away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, this was never to &amp;#8220;soak the rich,&amp;#8221; it was to make the economy more&amp;nbsp;productive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Milton Friedman became influential&amp;nbsp;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this whole idea of high marginal rates to deter presumed rent-seeking faded after the Great Society programs of the 1960s and the inflation of the 1970s. The thinking increasingly became the opposite of the era that preceded the 1970s. Allegedly, excessive and wasteful government spending was pushing up demand and overheating the economy, causing inflation. And because the private sector was seen as more efficient, the right thing to do was reduce government spending and taxes right along with it so that people could keep and allocate their capital as they see&amp;nbsp;best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result was that we then got the famous &amp;#8220;jaws of&amp;nbsp;death:&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="56f93b607427c6f77f3044cd82083e94.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/56f93b607427c6f77f3044cd82083e94.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s what income and wealth inequality is all about. It&amp;#8217;s about a world in which a rising tide was supposed to lift all boats, but it ended up lifting the bigger boats a lot more than the others. And the smaller boats took on water and are busy bailing that water out lest their boat&amp;nbsp;sinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You just need to read the post. It brilliantly summarizes the flaws in recent tax&amp;nbsp;policy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;all sectors positive except the very defensive staples and&amp;nbsp;utilities,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10Y steady at&amp;nbsp;1.57%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; is down to&amp;nbsp;51.3K. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada is starting to reverse loose monetary policy, like New Zealand. The pace of economic recovery suggests that rates will have to rise soon,&amp;nbsp;globally.&lt;/p&gt;

Cummings clearly doesn&amp;#8217;t play by the rules of Whitehall and is clearly the anti-Cameron.
Maybe it&amp;#8217;s just me, but I would infinitely prefer to have a pint in a pub with Cummings than with Cameron.

&lt;h2&gt;Stimulus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mario Draghi announced that Italy would spend €221 bn to stimulate the Italian economy.
This is a big number. 
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; will probably follow suit, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMF&lt;/span&gt; is recommending that countries run deficits of 5% of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; is hitting the ball out of the park, with combined spending of the order of $5T, about 25% of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;. The current bill is over 2T, which is intended to fix a few&amp;nbsp;bridges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italy will find itself mired in problems, because it is verging on being a failed state. Twenty five percent of taxes are not collected, according to &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/37854580-7ae0-42e6-b375-02c422d60882"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, which of course will just make anyone who is not well enough connected to escape paying his fair share cynical about the whole exercise. Sicily is littered with half-built overpasses, underpasses and road schemes that are simply not connected to the rest of the road network. It is not a coincidence that cement making is a monopoly, run by the mafia (whichever one controls the island). If the money spend just ends up in Swiss bank accounts controlled by criminals, I can&amp;#8217;t see it improving productivity in Italy, which refuses to&amp;nbsp;budge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Euro enthusiasts, like Martin Wolf, used to argue that once Italy got rid of the lira, it would be forced to confront its chronic productivity shortfall vis-a-vis Germany because there would no longer be the option of just letting the lira drift down against the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DM&lt;/span&gt;. How naive! Instead, politicians have simply forced the taxpayers of Germany to endlessly bail out the feckless and corrupt&amp;nbsp;Italians.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is interesting, is that nobody (well, no economists) have spoken out against stimulus. Well, Larry Summers, perhaps, but he soon shut up.&lt;br&gt;
Krugman thinks that the Republican party is no so far beyond the pale that even the small minority of Republican-supporting proper economists who would be sceptical about this are keeping their mouths shut, because the party now follows the advice of people who are simply not proper economists, like Kudlow and Peter Navarro.
Somehow, inflation is never coming back. 
Well, we&amp;#8217;re certainly going to test the&amp;nbsp;thesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Markets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; stocks hit by a Biden comment about doubling Corp Tax.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; stocks and Asian ones, pretty flat.
Bonds flattish.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; up a bit, 91.29, continuing its rally.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; continues to fade, $53K,
Metals (copper, gold and silver) down, other commods fairly&amp;nbsp;positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the reflation trade is not getting traction. 
Results are generally strong, but they are all baked&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/EOAN.DE?p=EOAN.DE&amp;amp;.tsrc=fin-srch"&gt;this stock&lt;/a&gt;. It pays a heavy dividend (4.7%), it&amp;#8217;s cheap as it was four years ago. It sells stuff that&amp;#8217;s going to get more expensive (because of green energy), 
it&amp;#8217;s in a region which is a world leader in terms of carbon emission reductions, it&amp;#8217;s got an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EV&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EBIT&lt;/span&gt; of about 1. 
Not advice, but worth looking at.
Probably the peers are good too, especially &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RWE&lt;/span&gt;. 
There may be a play in terms of legacy carbon credits granted to these generators, dating back to the time they had loads of power stations burning lignite.
With such a heavy dividend, long-dated call options will be cheapish. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IV&lt;/span&gt; is in teens, I think. 
It&amp;#8217;s a reflation play, of course,&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berkshire Hathaway has been criticized for paying too much money to the CEOs in waiting, by governance jobsworths.
This reminds me that Warren&amp;#8217;s days as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; are numbered, and Charlie Munger&amp;#8217;s more so. 
Many years ago, Warren predicted that his dying would be the best news ever for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BRK&lt;/span&gt; A stockprice, and I think his analysis is spot on.
Almost certainly, his successors will start doing all the things he has resisted doing: spinning off bits which are questionable (e.g. for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESG&lt;/span&gt; reasons), paying dividends, buying back stock, granting massive share options to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; (which necessitates the buy&amp;nbsp;back).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Iron ore is going&amp;nbsp;higher&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;An economics lesson from a Nobel&amp;nbsp;laureate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/opinion/economy-inflation-retail-sales.html"&gt;Paul Krugman writes a piece about why core inflation is important but why core components may be different now to what they were in the 1980s.&lt;/a&gt; Krugman is a wonderful teacher. I think he can come across as an apologist for the Fed, and is certainly the antithesis of Rudy von Haverstein, another great commentator. It is really very important to read both points of view, before coming down on one side.
For what it is worth, I don&amp;#8217;t think that Rudy and Paul are as far apart as they probably think they&amp;nbsp;are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IPO&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Mania&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://chartstorm.substack.com/p/blog-ipo-trends-the-new-boom"&gt;Topdown Charts has identified a number of great charts to show the explosion in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IPO&lt;/span&gt; activity in recent months.&lt;/a&gt; A lot of very clever stock promoters, hucksters and investment bankers have decided that this is a great time to sell out. 
In a normal economic exchange, both buyer and seller end up better off. Mike Munger calls this a &amp;#8216;euvoluntary&amp;#8217; transaction. 
For securities transactions, this is not the case: a tradeable security offers no benefits other than a future stream of cashflows. 
The two parties to the transaction simply get cash. Making unheroic assumptions about their own lending and borrowing costs, both should end up with the same net present value when discounted to now.
So, the discrepancy of value comes down to differing expectations of future cashflows. 
One party in an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IPO&lt;/span&gt; transaction probably has a better idea of what the company will do than the other, and that party is the insider.
Don&amp;#8217;t forget that IPOs now are mainly about insiders and early investors cashing out: they are not about the company raising money to buy more physical&amp;nbsp;capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, take a look at this chart from the post, and wonder what comes&amp;nbsp;next:&lt;/p&gt;

There have always been a lot of very overvalued Chinese stocks. 
The question is: why is the market behaving differently now?
From &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TME&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bitcoin represents freedom from the&amp;nbsp;Fed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="dae0a417145bd2207cb76961dbbd42ba.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/dae0a417145bd2207cb76961dbbd42ba.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… on the other hand, maybe&amp;nbsp;not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Fed and&amp;nbsp;inequality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central banks maintain that their job is price stability, which they have defined to mean a steady decline in the purchasing power of money.
The Fed has the famous &amp;#8220;dual mandate&amp;#8221; to maintain &amp;#8220;full employment.&amp;#8221; 
Now they all want to fix climate change, and abolish racial inequality.
Truly, they are omnipotent in a way nobody would have believed in the&amp;nbsp;80&amp;#8217;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weird thing is that productivity has been low, and inequality rising, more or less the whole time that central banks have appeared to have control of inflation.
Inflation, like unemployment (and hence &amp;#8220;full employment&amp;#8221;) are highly abstract words with a multiplicity of definitions. 
Certainly, full employment does not involve getting unemployment down to zero, or labour participation much above sixty&amp;nbsp;percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are in an era where returns to capital have been huge compared to returns to labour. 
If you don&amp;#8217;t believe me, take a look at &lt;a href="https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTF&lt;/span&gt; happened in 1971?&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Equity markets, especially in Europe have fallen a lot.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTSE&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MIB&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IBEX&lt;/span&gt; and Nikkei have all fallen considerably more than 1%. 
Bonds have barely moved. 
Commodities have dipped a bit, but there is no real trend. Natural gas is back where it was last August ($2.7 per MMBtu).
Oil is down about 1% (between &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Brent).
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; equity markets are down again, by 60bp, but the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; is still up more than 50% YoY, so we&amp;#8217;re not exactly in a bear&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supposedly, the reason is that Covid cases are still not under control in the many countries in Europe where the vaccine roll out has been poorly executed.

&lt;li&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNOW&lt;/span&gt; is falling as unlocks&amp;nbsp;continue. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Supply and&amp;nbsp;demand&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an old saying in economics: &amp;#8220;never reason from a price change.&amp;#8221; I think this means that price changes can result from changes in the supply schedule or the demand schedule (or both): you can observe the price of transactions but you don&amp;#8217;t see which side of the pair of curves has moved.
We can observe changes in the accounting return on a stock, and tend to assume that the demand is controlled entirely by changes in expected return: it&amp;#8217;s the secondary market, right: the number of shares in issue is fixed, right? 
Well, wrong on several counts. The supply changes because companies are constantly issuing new shares for management share awards. 
But managers don&amp;#8217;t want to risk dragging down the share price as a result, so they tend to have the companies buy back the shares to sterilize the dilution that would otherwise occur.
But, more importantly, demand is a fashion thing. 
Everyone wants to get hold of cryptocurrencies, not because their return has changed, but because more people have heard about them.
This goes for stocks too.
Asset allocators gotta allocate. They shift demand from bonds to equities to venture capital to private equity to real estate and then to crypto.
And then to any new &amp;#8216;asset&amp;#8217; that can be fabricated: maybe a hedge&amp;nbsp;fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People in the markets love to analyze the return characteristics of stocks, and measures of comparative demand, for example discount curves and vol surfaces.
But fashion is a powerful thing.

&lt;p&gt;3, The last melt up has seen declining volumes&amp;#8230;maybe stuff is so hot nobody wants to sell&amp;nbsp;this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4, over 93% of the components trade above their respective 200 day moving average, a huge figure which eventually has led to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;correcting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we all know, overbought and extreme markets can go on for longer than most think. Given the volatility reset we find good opportunities in using relatively low vols to plan hedges via put spreads or replace longs with upside call spreads and other net long premium&amp;nbsp;strategies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We seem to have been here for about a year, constantly breaking ATHs, but less and less&amp;nbsp;convincingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yields getting&amp;nbsp;pummeled&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/rope-a-dope/"&gt;Alex Manzara captures the recent bond market action&amp;nbsp;perfectly.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, all real assets moving ahead. Bonds slightly up, but not matching oil etc.
European and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; equities have been strong this week.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; dollar trended down this week. The strong dollar of a week or so ago seems a thing of the past.
There is a drumbeat of inflation fears, but nothing very concrete. 
The decision of the Fed to announce &amp;#8220;average inflation targetting&amp;#8221; without defining the nature of the averaging (the time over which the average is targeted etc.) has started to worry some&amp;nbsp;commentators.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>RIP, Bernie Madoff</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/rip-bernie-madoff.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-04-15T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:46+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-04-15:/rip-bernie-madoff.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Journal&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Chamath would have made Bernie&amp;nbsp;proud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read today that Bernie Madoff, the operator of what was supposedly the biggest Ponzi scheme in history, has died in prison.
I think the papers should have qualified that by recognizing that the they were restricting the comparison to those schemes that had been exposed as such.
And I guess we should exclude the various unfunded liabilities that the public sector operates quite openly: is there anyone left who imagines that the National Insurance &amp;#8216;Contributions&amp;#8217; they pay in is put into a fund which is set aside to pay their pensions in old&amp;nbsp;age?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, SPACs and the rest of Project Ponzi will continue to thrive, and I&amp;#8217;d love to jump on the bandwagon if only it could slow down long enough for me to leap on.
A few stocks ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSX&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NKLA&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WKHS&lt;/span&gt;) have lost their shine, but the others continue to defy gravity. I watch, with interest, from the&amp;nbsp;sidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a separate note, it seems totally inhumane not to release prisoners who are terminally ill, to spend their remaining weeks with their families.
I see no purpose in keeping them in jail, other than to boost the profits of the for-profit prison operators. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; is a cruel country.
In the same vein, elderly prisoners in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; (and globally) whose health is failing and maybe suffering from dementia, should not have to spend their final days miles from their families. At least let them go to a suitable care&amp;nbsp;home.&lt;/p&gt;

Don&amp;#8217;t get me wrong: I think there is a 50% chance that he is&amp;nbsp;right!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cameron in the&amp;nbsp;desert&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="d444874bfe386cdd226eda79865e3fab.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/d444874bfe386cdd226eda79865e3fab.png"&gt;
I&amp;#8217;d heard about David Cameron, Lex Greensill and Mohammed bin Salman (&amp;#8216;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MBS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;) camping in the desert. 
I pictured them in shorts and sweaty tee-shirts struggling over a wobbly camping gas burner trying to heat up a tin of beans.
Well, not really, but I had not imagined that they would &amp;#8216;camp&amp;#8217; in the desert wearing suits, including ties.
The whole idea is beyond parody, to me at least: a sleazy lobbyist, ex-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt;, a banker on the make, and a murdering oil sheik, pretending to love each other, in the presence of the delightful Masayoshi Son, head of Softbank.  Truly, the rich are different to you and me: they have more money, but less shame&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly risk on. European markets up, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; markets up, Everything up apart from Spain, Italy, Shanghai and Moscow.
Moscow was down because there is talk of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; sanctions on Russia (richly deserved &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMHO&lt;/span&gt;). In local currency, this might not last. 
The ruble is down by ~1%, which will make mineral producers worth 1% more in local currency&amp;nbsp;terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond yields were down again. The 10Y was grinding down to 1.55%. 
Over the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YTD&lt;/span&gt;, all yields are up, but not by a lot (except Brazil).
The Fed has promised not to raise rates until 2023, and not reduce bond buying before they start to raise rates.
I think this has to start impacting longer dated T-bonds, but no evidence so&amp;nbsp;far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite a few food commodities are up a lot on the year. Corn has gone from $3.50 a bushel last August to $6.00 today.
Food prices going up rapidly tends to result, in due course, to political instability in developing countries.
Price levels seem spookily calm right now, but given a few &lt;em&gt;coups d&amp;#8217;etat&lt;/em&gt; in the developing world, things could look very different.
It&amp;#8217;s ten years since the Arab Spring, where food prices were a&amp;nbsp;factor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil and gold are moving together, even though the dollar is relatively&amp;nbsp;flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1983 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SDP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Manifesto&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.libdems.co.uk/manifestos/1983/1983-liberal-manifesto.shtml"&gt;This manifesto&lt;/a&gt; would have been one which the late Shirley Williams would have contributed, I am sure.
I a remarkable number of its policies have been implemented, but many have proved too difficult. The devolution and green policies seem implemented. The union legislation, less so. The overseas aid done. The policies to modernize industry and training, partially. 
The policies to fix housing have not been implemented, and housing remains a major failure of successive&amp;nbsp;administrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The section on inequality blandly asserts that spending on education will fix this. It seems clear that this will never&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Education, Health and&amp;nbsp;Housing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a united, civilized community requires decent standards in education, health and housing for everyone. The Tories have imposed savage cuts in the social services and an Alliance Government would increase spending to restore and improve&amp;nbsp;standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it will not be enough just to spend money. The social services are too centralised, too bureaucratic. They are often insensitive and unaccountable. We will aim to make the social services more democratic, attuned to the needs of the individual. In this way, also, they will become more&amp;nbsp;efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#8220;catostrophic&amp;#8221; event within the ruling family, a &amp;#8220;chink&amp;#8221; in the crown 
&amp;#8220;jewels&amp;#8221; so to speak😉 ; with a history which is not only highly 
conjectural and based more on fantasy of the English way of life and 
empire than it is based on reality&amp;#8230;but keeps getting repeated time 
after time, until it becomes so boring it makes us all go to&amp;nbsp;sleep&amp;#8230;.zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz😉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am slightly amazed that the death of a ninety-nine year old man, who was never in line to the throne, should cause such widespread shutting down of civic activity.
I have never understood the reverence with which the royal family is held, although I willingly concede that our system is, perhaps surprisingly, better than the alternative of having an elected head of state. 
Certainly, the idea of having a head of state with huge, and growing executive powers, such as the system found in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;, is a recipe for bad&amp;nbsp;governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Worth&amp;nbsp;following&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard an interview with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CIO&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.massifcap.com/"&gt;Massif Capital&lt;/a&gt; on The Market Huddle. He had some very interesting things to say about carbon credits, European &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESG&lt;/span&gt;, gold, lithium, uranium.
I urge you to listen to &lt;a href="https://markethuddle.com/"&gt;the episode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Corporatism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few commentators have been pointing out the collapse of capitalism into corporatism for years.
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Saving-Capitalism-Capitalists-Unleashing-Opportunity/dp/0609610708"&gt;Zingales and Raghuram&lt;/a&gt; did an excellent job.
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Myth-Capitalism-Monopolies-Death-Competition/dp/1119548195"&gt;Tepper and Hearn&lt;/a&gt; did a slightly less good job, but more readably.
&lt;a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/"&gt;Matt Stoller&lt;/a&gt; is doing a fabulous job, but against the massed forces of corporate America, the odds are heavily stacked against him.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMA&lt;/span&gt; (Competition and Markets Authority) is &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/search/news-and-communications?parent=competition-and-markets-authority&amp;amp;organisations%5B%5D=competition-and-markets-authority&amp;amp;order=most-viewed"&gt;predictably ineffective&lt;/a&gt;, tackling minor breaches but avoiding taking on any big industry with a high level of concentration (such as internet retail, credit card processing, government outsourcing, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTSE&lt;/span&gt;-100 auditing, housebuilding, building underwriting, casualty insurance, broadband infrastructure providers, off the top of my head, ignoring global monopolies such as internet search, smart phone operating&amp;nbsp;systems). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is weird is that no politician even acknowledges the existence of the problem. The Left seems to believe that capitalism is largely unchanged since Karl Marx was in his pomp and is the font and origin of all the ills of the world. The right seems to think it is similarly unchanged but that the competition delivers untold bounty to ordinary citizens, and that  “It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest. We address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages” is still a good description of how commerce&amp;nbsp;operates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is lobbying. The revelations in the wake of the Cameron-Greensill-Gupta Family Group fiasco gives a glimpse behind the curtain, and it is far from&amp;nbsp;edifying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/04/12/the-war-against-money-laundering-is-being-lost?utm_campaign=the-economist-today&amp;amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_source=salesforce-marketing-cloud&amp;amp;utm_term=2021-04-12&amp;amp;utm_content=article-link-1&amp;amp;etear=nl_today_1"&gt;A study published last year by Ronald Pol, a financial-crime expert, concluded that the global &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AML&lt;/span&gt; system could be “the world’s least effective policy experiment”, and that compliance costs for banks and other businesses could be more than 100 times higher than the amount of laundered loot&amp;nbsp;seized.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t suppose anyone is particularly surprised by this. Politicians pat themselves on the back, for passing laws that get approval from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;. Bankers get a better barrier to entry (who wants to start a bank if you have to recruit hundreds of expensive &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AML&lt;/span&gt; compliance officers?). Corporate lawyers get extra fees for having to spend more hours finding the loopholes in the system (which their firms drafted in the first place). Oligarchs have their control of the distribution of dirty money strengthened. Retail bankers and lawyers get  some performative virtue signalling, playing their role in beating terrorism.  The police and other authorities get to claim that huge resource (conveniently not out of their budgets) are being spent on preventing money&amp;nbsp;laundering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Low&amp;nbsp;Volume&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="c2a26182f5efd86b5febe9f8a2ae628a.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/c2a26182f5efd86b5febe9f8a2ae628a.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volume is always in a single asset. People are always buying &lt;em&gt;something.&lt;/em&gt; The problem is that they stop buying &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; and start buying &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt;. 
Until they really need to keep their savings in something 100% liquid.
Risk asset levels are a measure of confidence in the&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Krugman on corporation&amp;nbsp;tax&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/08/opinion/biden-corporate-taxes.html"&gt;Krugman writes an explanation of why the Trump corporation tax cuts failed so badly.&lt;/a&gt;
I hope this is not paywalled. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DM&lt;/span&gt; me @francismansell to complain.
Krugman explains that most &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; corporate profits are really monopoly profits, so changing marginal tax rates doesn&amp;#8217;t make much difference to investment decisions.
There&amp;#8217;s a lot more, but this is my takeaway, which of course strongly confirms my bias that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; economy is dominated by oligopolistic&amp;nbsp;firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not all taxes are equally effective in reducing&amp;nbsp;inflation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading the Krugman piece, I came across&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Inflation debate rages on and will dominate the market narrative this year and beyond. Question: if the stimulus in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; is fully funded through taxes does this remove inflationary pressures as demand simply migrates from Personal/Corporate sphere to Government spending? Sanford Bernstein thinks&amp;nbsp;not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Firstly there is still the question of the very sizable blip in inflation over the next 12 months – and with the degree of fiscal support plus very constrained supply it means that price increases over that time horizon are almost mechanical. Longer term tax can have some effect at offsetting it, but higher taxes are aimed at the upper end of income distribution where there is less propensity to spend marginal extra dollar anyway. In addition the ability to provide on-going fiscal support and maintain high debt levels creates an asymmetry around inflation risks which is different compared to recent years. Also bear in mind that whilst the Trump tax cut was meant to get companies investing and hiring, a lot of it just went to buybacks. Now it looks like we’ll get more direct spending, specific areas/projects and hopefully much more direct impact on new&amp;nbsp;jobs&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conventional (and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt;) narrative about inflation is that if it starts to run ahead you can just turn up the tax dial to damp it down. 
Not all taxes are equivalent, as this quote makes clear (via The Market Ear).
Part of the reason that we&amp;#8217;ve seem muted inflation is that the money in the economy went largely to the 1%, and that which didn&amp;#8217;t was barely enough for the 99% to cover increases in costs which are under-counted in inflation stats (health, education, housing). 
The Trump cuts were aimed at corporates and the rich. The recent changes will be&amp;nbsp;different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why your living room has a pile of&amp;nbsp;remotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/why-logitech-just-killed-the-universal"&gt;Why Logitech Just Killed the Universal Remote Control Industry.&lt;/a&gt;
I love articles like this, that lift the lid on hidden monopolies. 
You&amp;#8217;ve never heard of Harmony, but they were very, very big in remotes.
I always thought that Logitech (a Swiss co.) were good, but actually they are terrible at software, as the article points&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market seems to be directionless. 
The 10Y yield seems stuck at about 1.67%, other assets diffusing around this.
Economic news was all fairly predictable: very large deficits in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, with the BoE buying record quantities of gilts.
Everyone saying that uptick in some inflation measures is an artifact of the artificial drop in prices a year ago.
Well, some central bankers are saying this.
Well, one central banker is saying this, &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/feds-bullard-says-inflation-risks-wont-be-clear-until-later-this-year-11618248198"&gt;James Bullard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reflection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economics likes to create simple models. 
Countries with one or two goods produced, an economy where there is a single, homogeneous factor of production (e.g. labour), supply and demand schedules which when plotted form a smooth curve with almost no curvature.
It&amp;#8217;s good to help our intuitive understanding that we use models like this.
A bottom up model, with millions of people the insane variety of goods and services in the real economy would be computationally, and operationally&amp;nbsp;impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One simplification is the idea of autonomous agents, who possess some sort of utility function, linked to their consumption of all possible goods and services.
But many of the things we consume are consumed for the benefit of others. Nobody buys life insurance for himself, only for his dependents, and those who lend him money. 
Most people do not make a buying decision about products like healthcare based on any in-the-moment calculation of the benefits of a treatment.
Education is consumed by people who have (almost exclusively) not the faintest idea of whether it will have any economic or other&amp;nbsp;value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not that we should not study these things. It&amp;#8217;s that we probably will never understand economics as well as we understood physics a hundred years&amp;nbsp;ago.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Will the last bear to go into hibernation turn out the lights?</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/will-the-last-bear-to-go-into-hibernation-turn-out-the-lights.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-04-09T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:46+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-04-09:/will-the-last-bear-to-go-into-hibernation-turn-out-the-lights.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Sustainability&amp;nbsp;Inc&amp;#8221;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been sceptical about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESG&lt;/span&gt; investing. 
The idea that you can direct investment towards &amp;#8220;green&amp;#8221; businesses an thereby somehow fix the problem of fossil fuels has never chimed with me.
If it works at all, it would do so by increasing the cost of capital of oil companies to the point that producing energy by burning fossil fuels ceased to be competitive.
But this requires that the &lt;em&gt;marginal&lt;/em&gt; investor has to be prepared to trade investment returns for the ability to signal virtue.
As long as &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; is willing to fund Exxon, surely, Exxon will continue to produce the world&amp;#8217;s cheapest energy.
And since we&amp;#8217;re not (it seems) actively stopping consumers buying electricity made from fossil fuels, they are going to continue to be&amp;nbsp;used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Blackrock disinvests in $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTU&lt;/span&gt;, the stock gets cheaper, which (at least in the short term) just makes it a more attractive&amp;nbsp;investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it seems that the former chief investment officer for Sustainable Investing [sic] at Blackrock agrees. You can read his piece &lt;a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2021/03/16/wall-street-esg-sustainable-investing-greenwashing-column/6948923002/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; has an article about this &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/984d952c-fea6-432f-8938-21e532d513d8"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s behind a paywall. It was about the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMF&lt;/span&gt; press conference; this is an&amp;nbsp;extract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a press conference on Thursday, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMF&lt;/span&gt; managing director Kristalina Georgieva said “it makes sense” to tackle as one problem the dual crises of debt pressures on developing countries and their vulnerability to climate change. “Green debt swaps have the potential to contribute to climate finance,” Georgieva said. “We are going to work with the World Bank, and by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COP26&lt;/span&gt; we will advance that option, which, of course, is then for creditors and debtors to decide whether to&amp;nbsp;embrace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Didn&amp;#8217;t Bhutan do&amp;nbsp;well?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;pickerSort=desc&amp;pickerMetric=new_vaccinations_smoothed_per_hundred&amp;Metric=People+vaccinated&amp;Interval=Cumulative&amp;Relative+to+Population=true&amp;Align+outbreaks=false&amp;country=BHR~BRA~CHL~DEU~HUN~IND~ISR~RUS~SRB~TUR~GBR~USA~URY~CHN&amp;hideControls=true" loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, this chart probably doesn&amp;#8217;t include Bhutan, but it seems to have innoculated most of its citizens against Covid in a week.
What is wonderful about these sorts of charts is that governments are shown up for how incompetent they are, so often.
Bigger governments should benefits from scale economies and what Ronal Coase called &amp;#8220;marketing costs&amp;#8221; (we&amp;#8217;d now probably say &amp;#8220;transaction costs&amp;#8221;), but in practice they are often fantastically inefficient, as demonstrated by the performance of other&amp;nbsp;countries.&lt;/p&gt;

Probably Powell will get a second term, but that is not, presumably,&amp;nbsp;guaranteed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The current crop of woke central bankers are going on parade in the coming week&lt;/strong&gt;, with Riksbank’s Ohlsson on Monday participating in a webinar to discuss “&lt;strong&gt;distributionary effects&lt;/strong&gt; of current monetary policy”. He will likely conclude that the current policy is not causing problems, or if it is, then it’s either not the Riksbank’s fault, or it’s all worth it (even the &lt;a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w27849"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NBER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has found that central bank researchers who report successful policy experience more favourable career outcomes. Why? Because incentives&amp;nbsp;matter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed’s Daly, Mester, Bostic and Rosengren are then set to go on to discuss &lt;strong&gt;racism&lt;/strong&gt; (Tue) – whatever that has got to do with the Fed’s mandate … Then social justice concerns take a breather for a little while, as Harker (Tue), Powell and Clarida (Wed) will discuss two parts which are actually part of the Fed’s mandate, i.e. the economy and the policy framework. Then we return to &lt;strong&gt;social justice&lt;/strong&gt;, with Bostic to discuss &lt;strong&gt;racism&lt;/strong&gt; (Wed) and &lt;strong&gt;inequality&lt;/strong&gt; (Wed), while Mester has chosen to discuss &lt;strong&gt;inclusion&lt;/strong&gt; (Thu). For some reason, Daly is set to speak on financial stability (Thu), maybe she wanted to take a pause from discussing the future of &lt;strong&gt;education&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, few of these central bank speeches are likely to be of much relevance for the market, but the list of topics reveals that these so-called “independent” central banks have become extremely political (if you think it’s not, go ask the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAGA&lt;/span&gt; crowd what they think) and have become so in an extremely short span of time. Perhaps this is partly about “&lt;strong&gt;beating the other girls to the bride’s bouquet”&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e. the bouquet being the &lt;a href="https://corporate.nordea.com/article/63638/global-the-dollar-smile-and-its-future"&gt;next chair of the Fed&lt;/a&gt;?). After all: “if there&amp;#8217;s one fool for you then I am it&amp;nbsp;(Janet)”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, central banks think they have saved the world&amp;#8217;s economies, and can afford to move onto other problems the world faces. I am not so sure, and I&amp;#8217;m not so sure that the whole world agrees with bankers that the only problems facing the world a few degrees rise in the temperature and some individuals from minority groups feeling&amp;nbsp;overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The General Semantics of Wall&amp;nbsp;Street&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book by John Magee, seems to be about investing. But it&amp;#8217;s really about how to see the world, and how to communicate ideas about it. 
It&amp;#8217;s about the difference between words and their meaning, between maps and the territory they represent (a metaphor which is heavily used in the book).
It&amp;#8217;s about humility in approaching the world in general, but also stock prices.
It&amp;#8217;s about recognizing that a small scale map, which lacks fine detail, may be useful and, in some situations, more useful than a large scale&amp;nbsp;map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s hard to summarize the book, as it is very discursive and almost rambling. The last part is about how to achieve happiness in life by accepting one&amp;#8217;s lot. 
This is a valuable lesson, but it will not tell the reader which options to&amp;nbsp;buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be purchased quite cheaply from Amazon, although it seems to have been &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OCR&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;d as part of some library project and may be available&amp;nbsp;non-commercially.&lt;/p&gt;

His position on bitcoin is nuanced: he has always thought it was a Ponzi scheme, but he&amp;#8217;s gone very long anyhow.
Now, his view has changed, and he&amp;#8217;s getting out.
You should read the piece, but he basically says that his gut instinct tells him that the game is up.
I missed out on the rally, but I&amp;#8217;m far too risk averse to try shorting this crazy thing.
At some point it&amp;#8217;s going to crater, just like $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;, but until it&amp;#8217;s established a clear longish term trend down, it&amp;#8217;s best to stand well back.
A lot of people are going to spend a lot of  money to support &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; before they throw in the&amp;nbsp;towel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is interesting is that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; is, to me, the purest measure of sentiment.
If people see &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; grinding lower, they may start to get nervous about the rest of the Ponzi sector. 
It&amp;#8217;s just an idea&amp;nbsp;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Has China&amp;nbsp;Won?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/43421aa9-7b67-4fe3-8559-90c2e3597030"&gt;Kishore Mahbubani thinks that China is doing a much better job of giving its citizens what they want.&lt;/a&gt; 
Science works by coming up with a hypothesis, and trying to find counterexamples to what it predicts.
A fairly persuasive theory of political science is that only democracies make their citizens better off, because only democracies need the consent of the governed to keep governments in power. 
Dictatorships find that it&amp;#8217;s much most cost effective for leaders to suppress dissent, and distribute resources controlled by the govt. to insiders.
It&amp;#8217;s relatively hard to do this when those resources are taxes payed by ordinary people: if you want to have a good life as an autocrat, make sure you pick a country with bags of mineral wealth – you&amp;#8217;ll last much longer. 
The problem is that in some ways, China does act like a democracy: although it&amp;#8217;s tax rates, especially for the modest middle class is very high, people put up with them as they see their standard of living improving year on year, courtesy of rapid economic growth. 
China is a big counterexample to the theory that only democracies enable nations to prosper. 
Mahubabani says that China is terrified of getting into the same state as the old Soviet Union, where riots eventually overwelmed the authorities. Towards the end, the authorities admitted that the country was on the skids, which might have been true, but wasn&amp;#8217;t a good thing to say out&amp;nbsp;loud. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Iceland&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;#8217;t do experiments in economics. But we can examine different countries, especially ones with radically different politics, central bank operation and interest rates to ours.
&lt;a href="https://pileusmmt.libsyn.com/94-olafur-margeirsson-a-job-guarantee-for-iceland"&gt;This podcast&lt;/a&gt; discusses a number of ways in which Iceland differs radically from the rest of Europe. It is worth listening to, even if you think that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; is voodoo&amp;nbsp;economics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;More Inflation …&amp;nbsp;analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://corporate.nordea.com/article/64594/fx-weekly-wage-inflation-is-coming"&gt;Labour costs are rising, even in the middle of a pandemic in which nobody of working age has died&lt;/a&gt;. Obviously, this is not literally true, but the supply of labour has not been hugely affected by the pandemic. 
The implication for this are that (i) wages …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More Inflation …&amp;nbsp;analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://corporate.nordea.com/article/64594/fx-weekly-wage-inflation-is-coming"&gt;Labour costs are rising, even in the middle of a pandemic in which nobody of working age has died&lt;/a&gt;. Obviously, this is not literally true, but the supply of labour has not been hugely affected by the pandemic. 
The implication for this are that (i) wages will go up and (ii) housing services will go up in price. A lot of factors impinge on house prices, but over the long term they do track labour income pretty&amp;nbsp;closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other tip that Nordea has is to go long &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLN&lt;/span&gt; vs &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EUR&lt;/span&gt;. The argument is that Europe is recovering quicker than expected and currencies like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLN&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HUF&lt;/span&gt; have a &amp;#8216;high beta&amp;#8217; with respect to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EUR&lt;/span&gt;. Sounds plausible, and is supported by recent strong performance of European&amp;nbsp;stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Red Wall is comfortably&amp;nbsp;orf&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2021/04/03/the-truth-behind-the-tories-northern-strongholds"&gt;The metropolitan idea of what the North is like is out of date and&amp;nbsp;misleading.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Margin&amp;nbsp;requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed has the ability to set minimum margin requirements. It has had this for many decades, probably since the 1929 crash, or shortly afterwards. 
In practice, &lt;a href="https://wallstreetonparade.com/2021/04/archegos-wall-street-was-effectively-giving-85-percent-margin-loans-on-concentrated-stock-positions-thwarting-the-feds-reg-t-and-their-own-margin-rules/"&gt;prime brokers for Archegos could easily bypass these margin regulations&lt;/a&gt;. 
The meltdown of Archegos has faded from the news headlines, but the questions it raises are still relevant. 
If an unregulated &amp;#8216;family office&amp;#8217; could be holding positions which represent weeks of normal volume in S&amp;amp;P 500 stocks, how can we believe that the regulations to ensure systematic financial stability are working correctly, and will prevent a crash next&amp;nbsp;time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you know, I much prefer structural regulation, that creates an economic incentive for the banks to limit risk, rather than rule-based regulation that creates incentives for risk to migrate to unregulated parts of the market.
Total return swaps are not very complicated&amp;nbsp;things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fed&amp;nbsp;plumbing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://moneyinsideout.exantedata.com/p/to-catch-a-falling-knife-us-treasuries-12f"&gt;Eccles Building, we have a problem!&lt;/a&gt;. Chris Marsh is a wonderful communicator of the subtle problems around the Fed, the Treasury and monetary policy. In this post, he points out that the banks may be reluctant to hold any more longer dated T-notes and bonds. 
The risk seems to be that if the Fed actually does increase the duration of its funding, it will steepen the curve, and make banks even less willing to hold Treasuries, relative to other assets. 
The end of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SLR&lt;/span&gt; and the move by the public to hold assets in money market funds are all part of the bigger picture.
My, uninformed, conclusion is that this is bearish for long bonds.
This is certainly &lt;a href="https://think.ing.com/articles/rates-spark-and-were-off/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ING&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s thinking&lt;/a&gt; but the markets haven&amp;#8217;t responded as of today.
The problem is that the primary dealers are well aware that prices signal information, and may be supporting the price on a temporary basis to get through the next&amp;nbsp;auction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China property&amp;nbsp;market&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grant&amp;#8217;s Almost Daily was good. It&amp;#8217;s free, but there is no shareable link, so I copy&amp;nbsp;it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last call in the Middle Kingdom? The People’s Bank of China has instructed banks to tighten lending standards in order to cool down a red-hot property market, reports the Financial Times.  That follows last month’s warning from China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission chair Guo Shuqing: “Many people buy homes not to live in, but to invest or speculate,” Guo noted. “This is very&amp;nbsp;dangerous.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There looks to be plenty of room for a downshift. Medium and long-term consumer loans, mostly mortgages, ballooned to a record &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; 1.4 trillion ($210 billion) over the first two months of the year, up 72% from pandemic-addled 2020, while new home sales rose by 133% from a year ago.  Last year, Nationwide house prices jumped 8.7%, far outpacing the reported 2.3% rise in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;.  On Jan. 1, Beijing debuted its “three red lines” policy, which limits developers’ net debt at 100% of equity and liabilities at 70% of total assets while mandating that short term borrowings must not exceed cash reserves.  Those who fail to comply are barred from further&amp;nbsp;borrowings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, aggressive borrowing is endemic across China’s corporate sector, not least in housing-related enterprises. Citigroup economist Li-Gang Liu calculated that some 600 listed companies in China sport leverage ratios at least 20 percentage points above their sector averages, representing a combined &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; 11 trillion in market capitalization, equivalent to one-sixth of the total stock market.  Among that highly indebted contingent, a 100 basis point increase in the benchmark lending rate would consume the equivalent of 30% of their bottom line to meet that increased interest expense.  Within the cohort of notably leveraged property developers (accounting for roughly one-third of the total group), that same 1% tightening would gobble up 42% of their bottom&amp;nbsp;lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those facts color the efforts of China Evergrande Group (3333 on the Hang Seng), the nation’s largest property developer and Asia’s most prolific high-yield debt issuer, to put itself on the right side of the new regulatory regime.  Evergrande announced on last Wednesday’s earnings call that it plans to cut gross debt to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; 590 billion by June 30 from the current &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; 674 billion, then to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; 450 billion and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; 350 billion in 2022 and 2023, respectively. Currently coloring outside each of the three red lines, Evergrande management predicted that they will be in compliance with two of the three directives by Dec. 31, and all three a year after&amp;nbsp;that.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Divestitures from Evergrande’s hodgepodge of side businesses, including a 10% stake in online home and auto sales portal &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FCB&lt;/span&gt; Group for a projected $2.1 billion, are central to the deleveraging strategy. Yet listless recent performance from the conglomerate’s core operations may undermine those goals.  Evergrande generated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; 507 billion in revenue last year, well below the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; 566 billion analyst consensus.  So-called adjusted core profit slipped by 26% to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; 30 billion, while gross margins fell to 24% from 28% and 36% in 2019 and 2018,&amp;nbsp;respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the bond market remains skeptical.  B1/single-B-plus rated Evergrande’s senior secured, dollar-pay 8 3/4% notes due 2025 last changed hands at less than 80, equivalent to a 15.52% yield-to-worst and 1,459 basis point spread over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Treasurys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evergrande is far from the only developer caught offsides by the recent sea change.  Last week, Shanghai and Shenzhen-based Yuzhou Group Holdings Co. Ltd. (1628 on the Hang Seng) disclosed a drop in 2020 earnings to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; 117 million, 97% below its 2019 bottom line of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; 3.61 billion, earning a downgrade to B1 from Ba3 at Moody’s Investors Service.  The company subsequently told investors that revenues over the first half of 2020 are likely to be restated to as little as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; 7 billion from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; 14 billion reported last August.  Management is said to be seeking a waiver on an interest coverage covenant governing a dual currency loan signed last&amp;nbsp;month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Yuzhou&amp;#8217;s lights, outside forces were responsible for that dramatic reassessment.  According to a Wednesday dispatch from Bloomberg, the company attributed that profit and revenue evaporation to auditor Ernst &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Young’s “strict” revenue recognition standards, which prevented  the company from consolidating certain projects onto its balance&amp;nbsp;sheet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, blame the&amp;nbsp;umpire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explosion of the cost of drug discovery, linked to increasing regulation of drugs is interesting (see Twitter thread above, Eroom&amp;#8217;s Law, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/srewats?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1379305661926797313%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Fquery%3Dhttps3A2F2Ftwitter.com2Fsrewats2Fstatus2F1379305661926797313widget%3DTweet"&gt;srivats sivanandan&lt;/a&gt;.
Normally, people think: sure, what harm can it do to make sure that stuff is safe and properly regulated?
Nobody wants a repeat of the Thalidomide scandal.
But the brutal fact is that the drug companies welcomed the increased regulation, as it deepened the moat protecting them.
Politicians were in favour of it because, well, who doesn&amp;#8217;t want to be safe and protected from untested medicines, right?
This is just another example what is seen, and what is unseen. All the new treatments that were uneconomic, because not enough patients needed the treatment to cover the costs of tests.
All the research that would have been done if pharma research was not directed into producing symptomatic relief for rich world sufferers from chronic&amp;nbsp;conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bastiat understood all this around the time of the French Revolution, and I&amp;#8217;m sure most serious politicians are aware of what they are doing, but they also understand that if they want to be elected, they&amp;#8217;ll have to play along, because this is just too difficult to explain, just like pointing out that saving a few thousand jobs in a steelworks is probably going to cost far more jobs in the economy as a whole.  Well, maybe one day schools will teach economics as a mainstream subject …&amp;nbsp;maybe.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Archegos, Archiwent</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/archegos-archiwent.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-04-06T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:46+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-04-06:/archegos-archiwent.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellen has called for a global minimum corporation tax rate. Not sure this has made much difference to markets, as it seems unlikely that this is politically possible, certainly on a Marxists interpretation of history. 
The largest corporations derive huge profits from corporation tax arbitrage, and they are certainly not going to give that up without a struggle and a tsunami of&amp;nbsp;lobbying.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Roaring 20s or Liquidity Crisis?</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/roaring-20s-or-liquidity-crisis.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-04-05T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:46+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-04-05:/roaring-20s-or-liquidity-crisis.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Are we &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; in a reflationary&amp;nbsp;environment?&lt;/h1&gt;

Keynes talked about fiscal multipliers, but they are impossible to measure accurately, and some people think that they are actually divisors: when the government spends money, it shrinks the size of the&amp;nbsp;economy.&lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s always a good read, and it&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;free!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Negative note on $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BYND&lt;/span&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ve never been convinced about this company. &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4416445-beyond-meat-stock-steer-clear-here?mail_subject=bynd-beyond-meat-more-pain-down-the-road&amp;amp;utm_campaign=rta-stock-article&amp;amp;utm_content=link-0&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=seeking_alpha"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Market Eye makes a good point about a distressing lack of liquidity in large-cap &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; equities. We know that this has been a problem for a while, as demonstrated by various ramp operations, not least by Elon Musk with $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;. The suspicion is that reported volume is partially or largely wash sales between related parties. It&amp;#8217;ll be interesting to see what happens to the market when a player bigger than Bill Hwang gets into&amp;nbsp;trouble.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CBS&lt;/span&gt; ($30bn market cap) and Discovery ($20bn market cap) were down a neat 27% Friday, on what appears to be (allegedly) forced selling from Tiger Cub Archegos Capital. If this is the truth and there is nothing else going on here - this is a horrendous data-point on the true liquidity in the markets. The rumored &amp;#8220;block offerings&amp;#8221; from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MS&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GS&lt;/span&gt; were not multiple days of average volume. These are not some Mickey Mouse companies with shaky fundamentals. The only thing that is shaky is the &amp;#8220;true&amp;#8221; liquidity in the equity markets. Because it is non-existent. In a &amp;#8220;normal&amp;#8221; world this would have been done at maximum 5-10%&amp;nbsp;down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TME&lt;/span&gt; points out that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARK&lt;/span&gt; has no clue about how to manage risk. I copied the text &lt;a href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/tme-take-on-ark.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; since it&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;paywalled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find out more about &lt;a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/what-we-can-learn-from-a-big-boat"&gt;Matt Stoller&lt;/a&gt;. He&amp;#8217;s a commentator who has written extensively about the threat posed by the accumulation of power by the corporate sector in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;. As you are probably aware, I think this is a huge problem both in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; and Europe, certainly compared to the attention it receives. I am not sure I dare say it, but to me it looks like a much bigger problem than anthropogenic global warming. The interesting problem is how the end game plays out. It could be very&amp;nbsp;destructive.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Marine Le Pen may yet become the next president of France. It&amp;#8217;s going to be a tough fight, but she understands that if she can keep moving her party towards the centre ground the prize is hers. &lt;a href="https://atlantico.fr/article/decryptage/le-cas-marine-le-pen---peut-on-gagner-une-presidentielle-quand-seuls-34percent-des-francais-souhaiteraient-vous-voir-elue-abstention-adhesion-rassemblement-national-intentions-de-vote-election-2022-elysee-emmanuel-macron-lrem-citoyens-christophe-boutin"&gt;Read about the latest polls here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Housing in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; has been badly constructed for a long time. Various planning changes in the late 90&amp;#8217;s and early 2000&amp;#8217;s gave rise to a rapid increase in building of apartment blocks. &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ff6bef28-ae58-48d5-b916-d27374fddf53"&gt;They have a lot of problems&lt;/a&gt;. This is not a small problem: it affects maybe 5% of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; housing&amp;nbsp;stock.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Unemployment&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unemployment is a terrible number to base a central bank policy on. It is the difference between two numbers: the number of people who they should be employable and the number of people who are actually&amp;nbsp;employed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="embed-container"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=CtQu&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/js/embed.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The markets are still buying the Fed line that inflation is not happening. 
Gold has had a terrible quarter, although it is up 1.32% today. 
In&amp;nbsp;detail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;QQQ&lt;/span&gt; is up well over&amp;nbsp;1%, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;other &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; indices flat or slightly&amp;nbsp;up,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;very odd mix of sectors up: tech &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; utilties, with consumer discretionary&amp;nbsp;(motors),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;value down (staples, industrials, real estate, and of course the hated energy sector plus banks): reflation trade dead (or&amp;nbsp;dormant?),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;global equity&amp;nbsp;mixed,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bonds pretty flat: 10Y @&amp;nbsp;1.73%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the end of the quarter. 28% corp. tax with measures to prevent offshoring of profits might dent the stockmarket, but it may never&amp;nbsp;happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Soapbox&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economies benefit from rapid population growth. The Industrial Revolution, which delivered huge material gains to the mass of the population at the time, and even more to their descendants, was accompanied by a rising birthrate (and a declining infant mortality). Australia has enjoyed growth through immigration. Similarly &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HK&lt;/span&gt;, Singapore, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; (compared to neighbours). A young country is a productive country; short of forcing citizens to reproduce the only way to achieve this is to welcome&amp;nbsp;immigrants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many mechanisms for sharing the benefits of immigration with those who lose economically: older native workers, and the taxpayers of country of origin (who have paid for the training of all the Indian GPs who come to work in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;). The ideal would be a market based one (e.g. a bidding system for visas, the proceeds of which would be paid to the originating country authorities) but the details are left to clever minds than mine.  We could restrict immigration to economically disadvantaged areas, which typically have plenty of schools and houses. There are lots of&amp;nbsp;schemes.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, there are political problems, but if we do not embrace immigration we will be poorer. If we choose to be poorer, well that&amp;#8217;s democracy, but politicians should not be allowed to pretend things will be&amp;nbsp;different.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>TME take on ARK</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/tme-take-on-ark.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-03-31T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:55+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-03-31:/tme-take-on-ark.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I stole this from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TME&lt;/span&gt;, which is now paywalled.

&lt;h1&gt;(When) is Cathie’s 27% discount placing&amp;nbsp;coming?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquidity is an issue, and most people do not think about the liquidity factor until it&amp;#8217;s too late, including risk&amp;nbsp;managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two takeaways from Friday&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;sessions;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1, the extreme px axction in Baidu, Tencent Music, Vipshop, Viacom, Discovery, Farfetch, iQiyi and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSX&lt;/span&gt;. For more reading on who and how they sold these positions see here. One thing is sure, when even big names trade with this type of liquidity, stability does not come to our minds as one of the strong factors of this&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2, the second observation is that despite these names oscillating massively, market shrugged off this and squeezed into the&amp;nbsp;close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does not matter who was behind the original sales of these stocks, but more importantly is to consider the illiquid market environment we are living&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even seasoned fund and risk managers tend to get surprised when things go the &amp;#8220;impossible&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular readers of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TME&lt;/span&gt; know our take on last year&amp;#8217;s hottest fund,&amp;nbsp;Ark-funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have covered &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARKK&lt;/span&gt; in various notes over the past months. On Feb 17 we warned our readers about the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARKK&lt;/span&gt; hype as we&amp;nbsp;wrote;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARKK&lt;/span&gt; - everybody worried not enough stuff to&amp;nbsp;buy&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;but looks like people should care more about how it behaves when they need to&amp;nbsp;sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARKK&lt;/span&gt;, investing in stuff that &amp;#8220;changes the way the world works&amp;#8221;, but as always you need to ask yourself at what price are they changing the world, as well how does it behave in terms of liquidity on the way down, just in&amp;nbsp;case.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARKK&lt;/span&gt; has crashed by some 25%. The &amp;#8220;stress&amp;#8221; of not enough things to buy has turned into discussions of how to manage the downside&amp;nbsp;risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 15 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARK&lt;/span&gt; released a video discussion, A Capacity &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Liquidity Analysis by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Invest&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TME&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s take on the 1 hour video was basically as outlined here. We&amp;nbsp;wrote;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Needless to say, but having three &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARK&lt;/span&gt; people&amp;#8221; including the big &amp;#8220;boss&amp;#8221; talk about her own funds and liquidity is hardly an objective approach to risk and liquidity&amp;nbsp;management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do they manage downside risk is basically, according to&amp;nbsp;Cathie;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;..we will put in more large cap stocks in the portfolio&amp;#8230;.which we see as cash&amp;#8230;.when risk off hits the market&amp;#8230;.we sell &amp;#8220;cash&amp;nbsp;stocks&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go figure what the funds will end up with if things turn properly sour&amp;#8230;.Highly illiquid stocks impossible to&amp;nbsp;manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone that has managed a big book of illiquid assets knows how hard these &amp;#8220;things&amp;#8221; are to&amp;nbsp;manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this one hour presentation there is a lot of mentions of &amp;#8220;if we are right&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230;but not one mention of &amp;#8220;if we are&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anybody talking about risk and liquidity management that does not talk about &amp;#8220;what if we are wrong&amp;#8221; has little clue about real risk&amp;nbsp;management.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge funds that have to release video presentations of how they manage the downside should probably be a warning sign&amp;nbsp;itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number one rule in managing risk is to &amp;#8220;master&amp;#8221; your downside in order for your p/l to not fall too much. After that lesson comes various other aspects of how to optimize your p/l on the way up (i.e what and how do you do when your trading is doing&amp;nbsp;well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, first chart shows performance of the top 10 names in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARKK&lt;/span&gt; since mid Feb. The best one is believe it or not Tesla, down&amp;nbsp;22%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second and third images show the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARKK&lt;/span&gt; top 10 names in terms of size. Bidu was &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s biggest buy last week. Only on Friday &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARKK&lt;/span&gt; added 323,410 shares to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARKK&lt;/span&gt;, and total &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIDU&lt;/span&gt; longs to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARK&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8220;family&amp;#8221; on Friday was around 545k&amp;nbsp;shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cathie buying more of a crashing stock she is already very long is the classical averaging down strategy, which is a very dangerous strategy. Sure, Bidu and other crashed ex hot names could bounce, but that is not how you conduct risk management. That strategy is based on hope and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; efficient risk&amp;nbsp;management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARKK&lt;/span&gt; is down from 160 to 114 in little more than a month. 200 day moving average is down at 106. Our logic from mid Feb (see above) continues to hold. Obviously the price is down a lot, but the bigger picture problem is how does &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARK&lt;/span&gt; funds start behaving should we see more of those moves we saw on&amp;nbsp;Friday?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Averaging down is the casino mentality so many traders and portfolio managers get &amp;#8220;stuck&amp;#8221; in. Focus goes from managing risk to justifying with fundamental reasons why you have a position on and add to it when it goes against you. This becomes a dangerous game when you run external&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine bigger redemptions would hit some of Cathie&amp;#8217;s funds? After all external money does not care how you performed 1, 2 or 5 years ago. They want you to always&amp;nbsp;perform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem with adding to losing trades is the fact that &amp;#8220;making it back&amp;#8221; is extremely much harder than following a rigorous p/l management&amp;nbsp;methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, losing 40-50% is not hard (just look at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TDOC&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARKK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s portfolio, down 40% since mid Feb), but in order to break even on a 50% draw down, you have to make &amp;#8220;back&amp;#8221; 100%. How easy is it to make&amp;nbsp;100%?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last image shows the simple table of how much you have to &amp;#8220;make back&amp;#8221; in order to break even on an X initial loss. Nothing new really, but few think about it, and even fewer have a method of how to manage it (not to mention how few people know how to behave when things go your way, ie adding to good p/l by expanding&amp;nbsp;risk).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, people tend to trade constant risk (totally wrong), and are happy to average down instead of averaging &amp;#8220;up&amp;#8221; (adding to winning&amp;nbsp;p/l).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charitable work, when done by grassroots volunteers, can be life enhancing for many individuals. When used by the 0.01% to launder their reputations, that&amp;#8217;s not always the case. I&amp;#8217;m not saying that charitable giving is &lt;em&gt;prima facie&lt;/em&gt; evidence for wrong doing, I&amp;#8217;m saying that when a big time investor wants to avoid close scrutiny, he tends to give money away to high-profile good causes (and political&amp;nbsp;parties). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should declare an interest, of a very dilute kind. A Chinese billionaire donated something of the order of fifteen million pounds to build a new building for my old college. Old members were assured that there was no &lt;em&gt;quit pro quo&lt;/em&gt; involved, and I am sure that no explicit demands were made. But I imagine that tutors will be that bit less inclined to publicly criticize the Xi regime in future … just in&amp;nbsp;case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Bill Hwang, who ran the fund that below up on Friday, also co-founded the Grace and Mercy Foundation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His charity *purchased* swap losses and offshore trusts from his fund. &lt;a href="https://t.co/dBlbHRK3aP"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dBlbHRK3aP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Edwin Dorsey (@StockJabber) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StockJabber/status/1376282012663881728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Is the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; a corrupt&amp;nbsp;place?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/10/uk-corrupt-nation-earth-brexit-money-laundering"&gt;A lot of people think so.&lt;/a&gt;
I don&amp;#8217;t have any first hand evidence, but the extreme foot dragging over enforcing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; checks for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; company directors, and the ability to create English and Scottish LLPs with partners/directors who are exclusively overseas corporate entities, with no restriction on where those entities are registered seems to point in this direction.
Practically every issue of Private Eye points to some obstruction or other by the government blocking transparency of beneficial ownership. 
If the population of Norway is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; with every individual having his tax return in the public domain, surely we can reveal who is the real owner of, for example, &lt;a href="http://www.insideworldfootball.com/2021/03/23/abramovich-sues-book-publisher-claimed-putin-told-buy-chelsea/"&gt;Chelsea Football Club&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might have all this wrong. Maybe there are genuine reasons why the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; media lost interest in &lt;a href="https://panamapapers.org/"&gt;the Panama Papers&lt;/a&gt; so promptly. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s perfectly fine that hardly anyone writes about &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54225572"&gt;the FinCEN files&lt;/a&gt;. But it doesn&amp;#8217;t seem logical, when every day is a slow news day and publications, even the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;, have the time and resources to cover a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; interview of some annoying &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; actress who is married to a minor &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; Royal.  The problem is that if you start drawing attention to this, and maybe talk about Jeffrey Epstein and his links to Mossad, you sound like one of the tin foil hat brigade and then you guarantee that everyone tunes&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve recently heard a lot about how Jeremy Heywood brought Lex Greensill into 10 Downing Street to devise schemes that seemed to have no purpose other than to enrich the investors in Greensill Capital, how David Cameron stood to gain sixty million pounds from his options in that very bank, and how government loans enabled the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GHG&lt;/span&gt; companies that were the main borrowers from Greensill. But until the collapse of Greensill happened, we heard precisely nothing about this. The same goes for Bill Hwang. A lot of people knew about what was going on. They obviously didn&amp;#8217;t trust the establishment to protect&amp;nbsp;whistleblowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few honourable organizations which appear to escape the self-censoring of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSM&lt;/span&gt;. Full Fact, &lt;a href="https://fullfact.org/"&gt;fullfact.org/&lt;/a&gt; is one. Transparency International (https://www.transparency.org.uk/) is&amp;nbsp;another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; 10Y went up as high as 1.78% before returning to where it was yesterday (1.72%). That&amp;#8217;s really all you need to know.
Other markets marked time&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;equities pretty flat, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DJI&lt;/span&gt; hits &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATH&lt;/span&gt;,&amp;nbsp;again,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bonds slightly inflationary: 10Y Treas. now at&amp;nbsp;1.71%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;commodities up a few pc: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSCI&lt;/span&gt; up&amp;nbsp;2.53%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; continues to grind higher: nearly 93&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m always posting charts from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FRED&lt;/span&gt;, but just to show there are no hard feelings, here is a chart from Trading Economics, which is about the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;.
The explosion of debt is not so much, but (i) the measure is highly understated because of the large unfunded pension liabilities the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; has, (ii) the steady rise of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; makes it seem … not so bad. 100% of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; is well above the 60% maximum permitted under the &amp;#8216;Growth and Stability Pact&amp;#8217; that no longer applies now we are out of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s funny how when push comes to shove, these good intentions pave the road to&amp;nbsp;hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src='https://d3fy651gv2fhd3.cloudfront.net/embed/?s=gbrdebt2gdp&amp;v=202103291915V20200908&amp;h=350&amp;w=700' height='350' width='700'  frameborder='0' scrolling='no'&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Soapbox&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current state of care work in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; is chaotic. It is the health service before 1945. A patchwork of badly paid carers offer substandard care to poor people who still can&amp;#8217;t afford it. Much personal care to individuals who have age-related conditions which, should they be experienced by younger individuals, would be counted as medical conditions (and thus due medical care). Labelling doesn&amp;#8217;t matter, except it makes a big difference to who picks up the tab. Care for people with a medical condition is free. The support for this policy in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; is practically a national religion. Care for the elderly, frail and infirm is very expensive&amp;nbsp;indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than spend time having sterile debates about whether or not people have to give up their house to pay for this care (as against give up their portfolio of income generating securities they bought with the proceeds of the sale of their house), we should just put the two systems on the same basis. Of course, this will mean bureaucracy, inefficiency, and explosion of a management class, slow decision making. But we have that already in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt;, and we seem, collectively, to think that these things are a price worth&amp;nbsp;paying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Copenhagen Consensus is what politicians would do if they carried out a clear-eyed evaluation of the costs and benefits of various policies. The problem is they don&amp;#8217;t, because it would not be good politics. If we are looking at saving lives, and making saved lives better, we should divert resources to the poorest people on the planet. Unfortunately, those are the people who have no voice, because they live in countries ruled by psychopaths and&amp;nbsp;kleptocrats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe we should get rid of the kleptocrats. There are two problems with&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;kleptocrats are much more biddable, and can be bought for modest sums, especially when we turn a blind eye to &amp;#8216;commissions&amp;#8217; paid to cronies when the West sells defence systems to these&amp;nbsp;people,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there are probably no known examples of a foreign power successfully causing a country to transition from a dictatorship to a democracy. Just ask the Iraquis, or Libyans, or&amp;nbsp;Afghanistanis. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other approach would be to just say to people in very poor countries: &amp;#8216;come to our country: we need immigrants because our young people have to support and endlessly growing mass of old, unproductive ones.&amp;#8217; Well, we all know what happens to politicians who want to go down this&amp;nbsp;route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the planet, we need to stop handing out subsidies, and tax polluting businesses. But, how can we piss off those businesses, which employ so many workers, and pay so much to politicians in&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8216;donations?&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To boost the economy of the planet, we need to break down trade barriers, and support farmers in Africa, and educate the uneducated. Well, the ways that policies that would achieve these would cause problems for western politicians is left as an exercise for the&amp;nbsp;reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For what it&amp;#8217;s worth, here are the&amp;nbsp;recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower chronic child malnutrition by&amp;nbsp;40%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Halve malaria&amp;nbsp;infection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce tuberculosis deaths by&amp;nbsp;90%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid 1.1 million &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt; infections through&amp;nbsp;circumcision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut early death from chronic diseases by&amp;nbsp;1/3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce newborn mortality by&amp;nbsp;70%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase immunization to reduce child deaths by&amp;nbsp;25%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make family planning available to&amp;nbsp;everyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eliminate violence against women and&amp;nbsp;girls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Planet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phase out fossil fuel&amp;nbsp;subsidies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Halve coral reef&amp;nbsp;loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tax pollution damage from&amp;nbsp;energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut indoor air pollution by&amp;nbsp;20%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prosperity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce trade restrictions (full Doha): tariffs impoverish&amp;nbsp;everyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve gender equality in ownership, business, and&amp;nbsp;politics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boost agricultural yield increase by 40% (grain yields in Africa are still typically below what they could achieve in Italy at the time of the Roman&amp;nbsp;Empire!),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase girls’ education by 2&amp;nbsp;years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Achieve universal primary education in sub-Saharan&amp;nbsp;Africa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Triple preschool in sub-Saharan&amp;nbsp;Africa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/post-2015-consensus/nobel-laureates-guide-smarter-global-targets-2030"&gt;Prioritizing 19 targets instead of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UN&lt;/span&gt;’s 169 targets is equivalent to doubling or quadrupling foreign&amp;nbsp;aid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Twenty Eight Trillion&amp;nbsp;Dollars&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sounds like a&amp;nbsp;lot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seth here, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; of The Babylon Bee. I want to personally thank you for joining our email list. Well, &amp;#8220;personally&amp;#8221; might be a stretch. This is an automated message that gets sent to everyone who subscribes. And to be honest, I didn&amp;#8217;t even write it. CEOs don&amp;#8217;t have time to write emails. But I did tell somebody to write it, so you are actually hearing from me, albeit&amp;nbsp;indirectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know that Biden doesn&amp;#8217;t write his own speeches. Neither did Trump. But somehow they all feel they have to pretend, or at least not come out and acknowledge that some spotty intern wrote that stream of platitudes that passed for a&amp;nbsp;speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Brain&amp;nbsp;injuries&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An astonishingly high number of people suffer from traumatic brain injuries. One in ten &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/03/27/a-huge-share-of-prisoners-have-brain-injuries-they-need-more-help"&gt;according to this article from The Economist&lt;/a&gt;. I would never have guessed that it was as high as&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Markets&amp;nbsp;chatter&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ever Given, currently blocking the Suez Canal, might break up. If that happens, oil will bounce higher. One way of expressing a relatively pure view of this is via the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOK&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEK&lt;/span&gt; currency pair. Given the highly contingent nature of this, maybe an option would work&amp;nbsp;best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Grant&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Almost Daily&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;newsletter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s good to be the boss.  According to data from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCD&lt;/span&gt;, supply of domestic leveraged loans used to fund dividend recapitalizations (i.e., payouts to the borrower’s private equity sponsor) have footed to $20 billion so far this year, marking the busiest quarter for loans undertaken for that purpose since the end of&amp;nbsp;2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While adding debt to reward insiders might appear to be an adverse credit development, some take a more sanguine view.  A Tuesday bulletin from S&amp;amp;P Global Ratings announced an upgrade of Luxembourg-based vehicle glass repair company Belron Group, S.A., to double-B-plus from double-B.  The rationale: “Resilient performance and proposed dividend&amp;nbsp;recapitalization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;em&gt;Memento Mori&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Mondeo&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mondeo, successor to the Sierra, successor to the Cortina and for a long time the best selling car in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; is going out of production. Electric vehicles are the future, believes Ford, or – at least – Ford is required to&amp;nbsp;believe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Kagame,&amp;nbsp;Killer&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Kagame’s admirers say that as ruler of Rwanda, a once-benighted land, he is beneficent, even benevolent. Not if you believe even half of “Do Not Disturb”, a new study of his government by Michela Wrong, a journalist. Under her scrutiny, Mr Kagame has almost no redeeming features. Brought up among Tutsi exiles in Uganda, Rwanda’s neighbour to the north, in this telling he was the school sneak. He rose in the Ugandan intelligence service. Then Mr Kagame reconquered Rwanda. As a disciplinarian leader, she reports, he was known to comrades as “Pilato” (after Pontius Pilate) for overseeing punishments while washing his hands of moral responsibility. He is blasted, too, as a menace in the region. He should bear the bulk of guilt, reckons Ms Wrong, for a high death toll in civil wars initiated mainly by him in Congo. This book, full of detailed research, will enrage Mr Kagame and rattle his friends at home and abroad.&amp;nbsp;|&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/apr/08/tony-blair-intervention-rwanda"&gt;Tony Blair is a fan&lt;/a&gt;. You probably already&amp;nbsp;guessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; Inflation&amp;nbsp;Risk&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Wolf takes &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6cfb36ca-d3ce-4dd3-b70d-eecc332ba1df"&gt;thousands of words&lt;/a&gt; to argue that there is a material risk that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; may suffer inflation.
He points out that we have strongly negative real rates, high debt levels, both public and private, and an explosive growth of M3.

&lt;p&gt;Some stories of huge block trades being executed by Morgan Stanley. Suggestion is that it&amp;#8217;s an institution (e.g. hedge fund) in&amp;nbsp;trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clem Attlee was a heroic figure on the Left, and pretty highly regarded on the Right.
He and Margaret Thatcher were probably the only two twentieth century PMs who have left their mark, indelibly, on Britain. 
Like all good socialists, he focussed on relieving the oppressed. 
He was opposed by the Right for destroying institutions and they old way of life.
He would have been opposed by the libertarians for not allowing the population to dispose of the product of their labour as they chose.
Coase would have pointed out the huge transaction costs of using private insurance to provide healthcare and old age pensions.
All the political tribes view the problems of society through their own distinctive perspective, and none really even want to discuss an optimal trade off between the different goals they each want to achieve.
Politics muddles through, but political debate almost never acknowledges the existence of this trade off, let alone how to consciously go about measuring it and quantifying what is&amp;nbsp;lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arnold Kling has written about the ways that political ideologies fail to understand each other. 
I&amp;#8217;m not sure he&amp;#8217;s explicitly discussed the tradeoff, but it&amp;#8217;s a long time since I read any of his work on&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Another flat day in the markets</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/another-flat-day-in-the-markets.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-03-25T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:56+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-03-25:/another-flat-day-in-the-markets.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Note&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The markets seem to be directionless. Gold is up a bit, Comex futures near month now over 1900.

Oil is practically flat, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRB&lt;/span&gt; is up 1%.

The dollar is weakening, back to 90. General flows seem to suggest this is a conviction&amp;nbsp;trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other&amp;nbsp;news&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to be much news.
There is a lot of coverage of crypto, but I suspect that this is because of a lack of major international, financial or political news.
A lot of commentators are focussed obsessively on the Fed. 
It seems to be using the reverse repo facility, heavily, to shift all those T-Bonds that it keeps accumulating back onto the banks balance sheets. 
How buying up a huge chunk of the market (after the primary dealers have taken their vig) only to loan it back to the banks again seems an worse than pointless&amp;nbsp;activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://americancompass.org/essays/the-corporate-erosion-of-capitalism/"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; explains that companies do not function in the way they used to.
They no longer transform savings into productive physical capital.
They, in aggregate, are destroyers of physical capital.
This trend has been observed for a long time, and conventional accounting measures sometimes fail to reflect economic reality: if an airline leases all its aircraft, and so lightens its balance sheet, its existence still is the reason those planes got built, even if their owner, in legal and accounting terms, is some Luxembourg registered private equity&amp;nbsp;trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is a problem, because physical capital is a complementary good to  human labour, and work is a very rewarding activity for most humans. It does not just provide them with an income, it provides them with a sense of self worth and self respect. If we hollow out the physical infrastructure of the private sector, the consequences for the labour force, &lt;em&gt;i.e. voters&lt;/em&gt; will be&amp;nbsp;severe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chancellor&amp;#8217;s accellerated capital allowances might make a bit of a difference, but I do not see this trend being reversed by a tax gimmick. (I know the figures relate to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;, but, surely, something similar is happening in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consulting firm McKinsey has agreed to pay nearly $600 million for its role in advising Purdue on how to push opioids sales, even at the cost of human lives. The details of their work are gruesome and should demand self-reflection among all those who work in big business. Has the profit motive gone out of control, and do business schools have a role to play in creating this&amp;nbsp;culture? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anand Giridharadas says yes to both questions. He&amp;#8217;s the author of the renowned book &amp;#8220;Winners Take All&amp;#8221; and the publisher of &amp;#8220;The Ink&amp;#8221; on Substack. He joins us in this episode to discuss McKinsey, the culture of profits at all costs, and how businesses use philanthropy to distract us from the price we all&amp;nbsp;pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luigi Zingales and Bethany McLean host a wonderful podcast. These are not mad Bennites, they are a business school professor and respected economist, and an ex Bloomberg journalist. Every episode is worth listening to.
The best part, for me, is the phone call that Anand has with Jamie Dimon. You can read about it &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-finance-202/2019/10/23/the-finance-202-what-jamie-dimon-s-private-call-with-an-author-reveals-about-the-debate-over-capitalism/5daf71eb602ff10cf14f96cb/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; but it&amp;#8217;s better to listen to Giridharadas tell the story in his own words. To Dimon&amp;#8217;s credit, he did&amp;nbsp;offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main issue is the container ship blocking the Suez&amp;nbsp;Canal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Banks and&amp;nbsp;Money&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are odd things. They look like companies: they have shareholders, equity capital; they make profits and pay dividends. They borrow and lend and receive interest. 
What they do not do is ever go bankrupt, or at least not in a way that the resolution of their insolvency causes any harm to small depositors.
Their liabilities are, therefore, free of credit risk and hence are &amp;#8216;as good as gold&amp;#8217; or, more importantly, as good as promissory notes issued by the Bank of&amp;nbsp;England. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Macro Musings,&amp;#8221; the podcast, has many episodes which are concerned with this.
&lt;a href="https://macromusings.libsyn.com/dan-awrey-on-unbundling-banking-payments-and-money"&gt;The latest one&lt;/a&gt; is all about why the various functions of banks could, in fact, be unbundled, to remove the extravagant privilege which banks have in modern societies. 
Even though most of us have known about banks, and bank accounts, since we were very young, we probably haven&amp;#8217;t ever stopped to really think about what it is that makes banks, as incorporated entities, special.
The podcast is worth a listen, but it&amp;#8217;s clear that it would be useful to read &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Money-Problem-Rethinking-Financial-Regulation/dp/022633032X"&gt;The Money Problem&lt;/a&gt; by Morgan Ricks&amp;nbsp;first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the huge role that money, and banking, play in all societies, but particularly the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s surprising that bank regulation is so lightly covered a topic, even in somewhat specialist papers like the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Greensill really looks like a tar pit for Cameron. How can the guy argue he has good&amp;nbsp;judgement?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wall Street changes its tune on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; now it&amp;#8217;s a big enough &amp;#8216;asset class&amp;#8217; to attract investor interest and the fees that come with that&amp;nbsp;interest,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BlackRock should be renamed WhiteRock, because ethnic minorities are hired purely to meet diversity&amp;nbsp;quotas,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steel is not worth saving, but probably will be, but nothing will be done to change the corporate and economic environment in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; that makes steelmaking uneconomic (not least energy&amp;nbsp;prices),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LSE&lt;/span&gt; has a huge market cap, £40bln, now it owns Refinitiv, which will supposedly provide a stable stream of income, relative to trading (&amp;amp; settlement)&amp;nbsp;fees,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turkish Lira implodes, understandably. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZAR&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BRE&lt;/span&gt; to be&amp;nbsp;next?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oil sector issues a lot of junk debt because … it&amp;nbsp;can!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dollar strength seems to be clear, even in the face of so much debt issuance by public and private borrowers. The dollar remains a risk-off asset, and the Turkish Lira has presumably affected the risk perception in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;markets,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beeple (Mike Winklemann) agrees that NFTs are in a bubble. He recently sold a digital image for $69M. Probably explains why he didn&amp;#8217;t express this opinion publicly&amp;nbsp;earlier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is a bumper year for stock fraud. &lt;a href="https://thebearcave.substack.com/p/the-root-insurance-scam-root-bear"&gt;The latest issue of the Bear Cave newletter lists a ton&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Where to&amp;nbsp;blog&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking of moving off a static blogging platform, mainly to have an email newsletter. 
I was kinda thinking of substack, mainly because Kevin Muir moved to it. But &lt;a href="https://louiebacaj.com/where-to-blog-medium-substack-wordpress-ghost-or-roll-your-own/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; put me off. 
If what it says can be taken at face value, the extra control you have with Ghost makes it the top choice. 
Medium is worse (although if they feature you, they can drive subscribers up) and substack is intermediate, but are still annoyingly restrictive. Ghost seems to score, because 100% of their revenue comes from the author, and so they make their product to please him. With the others, the readers are also their customers, so they are not 100% focussed on the blog&amp;nbsp;author. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might just organize a mailchimp list and cut and paste my content. Less than ideal, but good enough for my needs, I&amp;nbsp;think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do like Pelican, because I can just write in Markdown, in vi if I like, and just run make, like the programmer I was, and a new post is published.
I can&amp;#8217;t see it getting easier than this. 
I can be entirely offline while creating&amp;nbsp;content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disaster of the vaccine rollout in Europe seems to be infecting global markets, leading to a risk off but deflationary&amp;nbsp;day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;energy commodities severely impacted: gasoline futures down&amp;nbsp;4.3%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most equity markets down: practically every global market. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; now up to 21,&amp;nbsp;nearly,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;curves flattening: 10-2s down to about 1.52% from a high of 1.65% last&amp;nbsp;week,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;even &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; down a bit&amp;nbsp;$54.5K,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;currencies mainly flat, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NZD&lt;/span&gt; falling a bit more, but from a high point (like the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AUD&lt;/span&gt;),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; rising against &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; currencies: up against the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TRY&lt;/span&gt; by 6%, but this is highly&amp;nbsp;volatile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was wondering why the radical left, and right are so terrible at winning elections, when their policies seem generally very popular. 
Part of this is the Median Voter Theorem, which says that in a two party system you can afford to ignore the political wishes of your fringe (and activist) supporters, because there is no where for them to go. 
This theorem makes a lot of heroic assumptions, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UKIP&lt;/span&gt; and the Lib Dems very existence invalidates it as a reliable guide in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. 
I think that partly its because parties end up getting run by people who are  interested in getting elected and getting re-elected. People who feel passionate about something, whether freedom, fighting inequality or protecting our cultural heritage are useful as supporters, but I feel they never really rise to positions of great influence in political parties.
It may be that a few individuals test that hypothesis:  Clem Atlee, Margaret Thatcher are the two that come to mind, but even they are seen as anomalies by their&amp;nbsp;parties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will crude do&amp;nbsp;next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rise of ETFs (which are mainly, but not entirely, passive) is going to end up destroying the buy side of Wall Street. And if the buy side is gone, the sell side is in&amp;nbsp;trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reversal of reflation trade seen today. 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; strong performer, and bonds. Driven by a dismal rollout of vaccine in Europe, and some new lockdowns.
They may well be right.
The market has changed its mind about&amp;nbsp;deflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SLR&lt;/span&gt; changes are having an impact on the demand for bonds. 
There are mutterings that this is likely to be a temporary reversal, but with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; rallying 6% on an analysis by a party (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARK&lt;/span&gt;) that are both talking their book, and have no credibility, it&amp;#8217;s dangerous to act on&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities have had a tremendous run over the last six months, with the exception of natural gas and precious metals.  Today the price movement was mixed, but no pickup in silver or gold, in spite of a lot of tweets predicting a silver&amp;nbsp;breakout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkish Lira took a huge dive as another central bank governor was sacked by Erdogan.
Other currency movement was muted. 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; was down 20bp. Not&amp;nbsp;material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reading about Danone the other day. 
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; has been forced out, although I doubt if he&amp;#8217;ll have to go on the dole.
The guy is known for his focus on environmental matters, but the commentator said that his mistake was to spend too little on advertising.
The assumption was that products didn&amp;#8217;t matter much for profits, but if you stopped adverting, you&amp;#8217;d lose money.
It got me thinking that the same goes for stocks. Tesla is exhibit A, but there are plenty of others.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPAC&lt;/span&gt; crowd understand this. Chamath is a celebrity (admittedly with some industry credentials). A lot of the other stocks have sponsors who don&amp;#8217;t have a clue about investing or business, but know very well how to get their picture in the paper (and their interview onto &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNBC&lt;/span&gt;). 
It&amp;#8217;s a rolling series of bubbles, but if it&amp;#8217;s   carefully tuned, it can go on practically forever.
There are companies that move their ethically dubious business model from country to country, making a lot of money in each from a cookie-cutter operation, until people realize that they&amp;#8217;ve been duped.
The risk is that we&amp;#8217;ll end up with an economy entirely composed of such companies, which doesn&amp;#8217;t sound like a good place to&amp;nbsp;live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The damage done by&amp;nbsp;monopolies&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/how-biden-can-clean-up-obamas-big"&gt;This post by Matt Stoller&lt;/a&gt; is mind blowing. 
It clearly demonstrates how corrupt the Obama administration was in enabling the dominance of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt;. 
It references &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/16/google-files-ftc-antitrust-investigation-475573"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, which is first class.
It&amp;#8217;s been obvious that &amp;#8220;vertical search&amp;#8221; (like Yellow Pages, aka Yelp) would suffer in competition with Google, but Google actively stuck in a knife and twisted it.
Politicians and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FCA&lt;/span&gt; were captured by the companies they were supposed to be regulating.
It&amp;#8217;s a familiar story, but it retains the ability to make me&amp;nbsp;angry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Investor Amnesia and&amp;nbsp;Meetups&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m near London. I am not averse to a few drinks. I was wondering with anyone would be interested in setting up a FinTwit group in London once lockdown is over. &lt;a href="https://investoramnesia.com/meet-ups/"&gt;There are a few of these already, but only in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;h1&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is becoming more international.
The web, social media, investing, news, political movements, identity politics, climate change, pandemics, cryptocurrencies, fintech are all global. 
But our laws are all stuck in nation-state silos, with no global mechanisms for enforcement or dispute resolution.
Not only do we not really have international law, to the extent that ordinary citizens can access it, the institutions that might interpret it are subservient to the interests of nation&amp;nbsp;states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consequence is that we have extreme variance in  inter-country welfare, which are vastly worse than intra-country equality, but national politicians have no remit, or incentives, to reduce them.
We just get starvation levels of poverty, desperate people risking their lives and their life savings to cross lines drawn on a map. 
We salve our conscience by sending bags of surplus grain (themselves a consequence of terrible, distorting agricultural subsidies that benefit rich western landowners) to starving peasants in Africa. 
No politician ever dares to make the case for a more rational immigration&amp;nbsp;policy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>US Treasury is spending big</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/us-treasury-is-spending-big.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-03-20T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:55+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-03-20:/us-treasury-is-spending-big.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Governments spend and receive money.

This generally involves the banking system.
Governments can have bank accounts at any bank they choose to.
Very often they choose to use one, which may be privately owned, or nationalized.
Surprisingly often, they are not publically owned.
It was not until the late 1940s that the Bank of England was nationalized, and even today one can buy shares in the central banks of Switzerland and Japan.
The most important central bank of all, the one that issues the world&amp;#8217;s reserve currency, is the Federal Reserve.
This is privately owned, but by a consortium of commercial banks.
It is notionally independent, but has various mandates, such as preserving the value of the currency and maximizing unemployment. 
The balance that the government maintains at the central bank is of interest to those who work at the bank.
I&amp;#8217;ve learned a lot about central banks by listening to David Beckworth&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Macro Musings&lt;/em&gt; podcast, which devotes a large proportion of its episodes to monetary policy and the operational side of central banks plumbing. His latest episode, with Chris Russo, focussed on the Treasury General Account, usually abbreviated to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TGA&lt;/span&gt;. Chris was, at least in part, responsible for predicting the size of the balance on this account. It used to be modest, but now it&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;really, really&lt;/em&gt; big, like several trillions big, and when it shrinks, as a result of the Treasury actually paying for stuff (like Social Security), money ends up in the bank accounts of the private sector, or what we normally think of as actual people. Who spend money on stuff.  Stuff that is in finite supply. Just thinking aloud&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://anchor.fm/chris-dark/embed/episodes/48-Response-to-MacroVoices-255-Episode-on-Bitcoin-epbns4" height="102px" width="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I listened to this podcast. It would probably be better if I had listened to the Macro Voices podcast to which it is a response.
I am sceptical of bitcoin. Chris Dark argues that this is because I&amp;#8217;m a boomer, and I don&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8220;get it,&amp;#8221; that I can&amp;#8217;t understand how a purely digital object can have value and that I can&amp;#8217;t be a &amp;#8220;digital native.&amp;#8221; 
And that I&amp;#8217;m comfortably off. And that I&amp;#8217;m resentful because I missed out on bitcoins massive bull run.
Well, not me, but the old guys in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MV&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dark points out that Bitcoin has some great value if you live in a country where the government is destroying the currency. He dismisses the use case helping finance terrorism.  I agree with a lot of what he says, and I agree that the blockchain is an amazing invention, and that some incremental development of the technology can solve some important problems, and this will create value, which &lt;em&gt;just might&lt;/em&gt; accrue to people who purchased the asset early on (as Dark&amp;nbsp;did). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For what it&amp;#8217;s worth, my concern about bitcoin is that there are so many cryptocurrencies around, many with properties that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; lacks, that it&amp;#8217;s virtually impossible to pick the winner from a field of maybe tens of thousands.
I know that many young people want to get on the crypto bandwagon, and many instinctively want &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt;, original and possibly the best (although hash cash was a precursor). I also know that fiat currencies are being created at a totally unprecedented&amp;nbsp;rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just think that even with &amp;#8216;modern&amp;#8217; crypto, like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETH&lt;/span&gt;, transaction charges remain un-affordably high for the purchase of ordinary items. I also know that most investors will leave their currency with the exchange where they purchased it, and almost none will run a full node wallet. I also know that a lot of people will lose a lot of money, betting on the wrong exchange or the wrong&amp;nbsp;currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I wrong about this, and should I buy some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt;? Quite possibly. A lot of European political leaders are now millenials, and they may decide to allow citizens to pay their taxes in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt;. 
Dark makes a lot of good arguments.
Time will tell, but I cannot make a conviction trade either way, and so I&amp;#8217;ll stay out of the trade.
But, as in all types of investment, I will keep an open mind and try to read and listen to commentators who are on both sides of the&amp;nbsp;argument. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Market Huddle had a good segment where Aiden Garrib of Pavilion Global Markets went through the following slide deck.&amp;nbsp;https://t.co/dlhySr5VE0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll have to listen to the show to get the full benefit, but my takeaway was that there will be modest rotation out of value stocks, we will see inflation, China will have a big influence on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ark-funds.com/tag/liquidity"&gt;Just listen to her&lt;/a&gt;, if you can bear to. Pick up the remarks at around 11m30s.  Insane: she breezily dismisses the risk that having a load of highly illiquid issues in her portfolio by explaining that she can meet redemptions by liquidating the more liquid names (like, presumably, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;), that will be relatively unscathed by a market selloff. Well, we may find out how this pans&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; version of Sarbanes Oxley likely to be as rubbish as the&amp;nbsp;original&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thedig.substack.com/?r=2mq6s&amp;amp;utm_campaign=pub&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_source=copy"&gt;That&amp;#8217;s the verdict of Francine McKenna, who knows about these things&lt;/a&gt;, and knowing the how recondite this topic is, and to what extent this is a wedge issue between the 1% and the rest, I think she&amp;#8217;ll be&amp;nbsp;right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cameron, an &amp;#8220;advisor&amp;#8221; to Greensill, lobbied for the govt. to guarantee their&amp;nbsp;loans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://digital.olivesoftware.com/Olive/ODN/FTUK/Default.aspx"&gt;Well, he would, wouldn&amp;#8217;t he?&lt;/a&gt;.
In the comments in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; online version, someone made the comment that it&amp;#8217;s just as well he&amp;#8217;s as hopeless as a lobbyist as he was as prime minister (he failed to deliver the support he lobbied&amp;nbsp;for).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quad&amp;nbsp;witching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expiry of futures, options, all sorts happening today. Also, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SLR&lt;/span&gt; is due to expire at the end of the month, and the dovish blandishments of Tuesday have already been forgotten, judging by equity&amp;nbsp;markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; not so friendly any&amp;nbsp;longer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior diplomats from America and China held their first meeting since Joe Biden’s election to the White House. The talks, in Alaska, opened icily—served with lashings of fire. Anthony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, accused China of threatening “the rules-based order” and thus “global stability”. His counterpart, Wang Yi, called America a “struggling democracy” that “suppresses other&amp;nbsp;countries”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from The&amp;nbsp;Economist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Elites baffled by popular distrust of experts, who are closely linked to those same&amp;nbsp;elites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/03/there-s-a-popular-backlash-against-experts-here-s-why-that-matters/"&gt;Yep, from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WEF&lt;/span&gt;, i.e. Davos&amp;nbsp;Man&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The current &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Monetary system is due to be&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8216;reset&amp;#8217;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/39c53b9f-f443-4dde-9cdb-07e8999ec783"&gt;Longview Economics expresses the view that the current system run by the Fed is existing on borrowed time&lt;/a&gt;.  I think Chris Watling is onto something, but I think that the Fed is good for another few years, or even chairmen. The current system, and the bias towards debt deflation, suits the 1% very nicely, and they&amp;#8217;ll do whatever it takes to keep the system&amp;nbsp;functioning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; Government clueless about improving energy performance of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;homes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bf38ee30-3aa3-433e-a557-dbef79df4c71"&gt;Chris Giles nails it&lt;/a&gt;. The article is behind a paywall, so I&amp;#8217;ve extracted the text and shared it &lt;a href="https://termbin.com/6iii"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The copy will disappear in a few weeks, so if it&amp;#8217;s gone, you&amp;#8217;ll have to pay to get into the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; website. Basically, Giles points out that heating houses generates as much carbon as surface transport, but the government is doing essentially nothing to reduce these emissions. The reasons are many, but largely to do with the incentives facing&amp;nbsp;ministers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty dull day, in the end. Quad witching didn&amp;#8217;t make a difference. Generally slightly inflationary/risk&amp;nbsp;on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; equity indexes mixed, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; up&amp;nbsp;0.4%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commodities recovering, after a rough day&amp;nbsp;yesterday,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most govt. yields&amp;nbsp;up, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;best performing equity sector comms, worst real&amp;nbsp;estate,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;small cap growth did best (+1.4%), large cap value worst&amp;nbsp;(-0.5%),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; up 1.2%,  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EUR&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; practically&amp;nbsp;flat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main news was the Fed announcing it will the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SLR&lt;/span&gt; (special liquidity ratio) that allows banks to count treasury bill holdings as cash.
The market seems to take a day or so to digest Fed announcements, so I am not sure that the relatively muted response to this is the last word from the&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart of the&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Philadelphia Fed General Diffusion Index is at practically an all-time high. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; is on the cusp of finally running its economy&amp;nbsp;hot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Marxist political theory&amp;nbsp;update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my comments a few days ago about Marxist theory of political power, I thought I&amp;#8217;d better educate myself.
&lt;a href="https://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/sociology/political-institutions/political-elite-marxian-approach-on-political-elite/31354"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; explains the theory quite well, I think.

&lt;h2&gt;Marxist political theory&amp;nbsp;update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my comments a few days ago about Marxist theory of political power, I thought I&amp;#8217;d better educate myself.
&lt;a href="https://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/sociology/political-institutions/political-elite-marxian-approach-on-political-elite/31354"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; explains the theory quite well, I think.
Marx and Weber/Pareto seem to differ. Marx thought that political leaders automatically followed the (maybe implicit) wishes of the elites. Weber and co with their power elite model argued that there was more flexibility and that the abilities of politicians had a role in determining the seat of power.
I am not a political theorist, but I prefer the Marx&amp;nbsp;vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not a bubble: asset prices are modest compared to funds available to buy&amp;nbsp;stocks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that&amp;#8217;s what Michael Howell says, &lt;a href="https://www.livewiremarkets.com/wires/a-bubble-other-ways-to-see-market-value"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s basically the Dot Com bubble argument that old world valuation metrics like P/E ratios are simply not applicable any more. I am not dismissing this: liquidity, and the search for real assets that have a &amp;#8216;track record&amp;#8217; of showing real returns hold a strong attraction for many investors, and when these investors are very liquid it&amp;#8217;s perfectly rational for them to invest in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANGMAN&lt;/span&gt;. Graham and Dodd really did miss&amp;nbsp;something. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TINA&lt;/span&gt; argument: you may now feel wild about buying the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; at a dividend yield of under 1.4% annually, but it might have some growth, and the yield might go up, both of which are clearly not going to happen if you buy 10Y&amp;nbsp;treasuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nordea on the Fed&amp;nbsp;Presser&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m very impressed by Steno Larson at Nordea on fixed income and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt;. Read
&lt;a href="https://corporate.nordea.com/article/64255/fomc-review-officially-behind-the-curve-and-proud-of-it"&gt;his report on the Fed press conference&lt;/a&gt;. His conclusion is that the Fed will struggle to hold down yields and the dollar will start to&amp;nbsp;rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alex Manzar on the Fed&amp;nbsp;Presser&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/trying-to-square-inconsistencies/"&gt;Worth reading, as always&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Atlanta Fed&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; Now estimate is 5.7%, vs 5.9% previously, &lt;a href="https://www.frbatlanta.org/cqer/research/gdpnow"&gt;read it here&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s really hard to see how inflation can be kept near 2% (even with a little overshooting) with nominal growth like&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How high do 10Y yields need to be for an equity&amp;nbsp;correction?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two percent, is the most commonly held&amp;nbsp;view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="aefbdf748f147deac78b5253c74cb54a.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/aefbdf748f147deac78b5253c74cb54a.png"&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Education makes you live&amp;nbsp;longer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/03/17/educated-americans-live-longer-as-others-die-younger"&gt;Says the Economist&lt;/a&gt;. Well, actually Anne Case and Angus Deaton of Princeton University. This is the latest of many statistics that shows that the more educated live longer, healthier and more rewarding lives. Clearly, we need to give those who are not good at taking exams honorary&amp;nbsp;degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A life on the ocean&amp;nbsp;wave?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/89846518"&gt;Not exactly, but on water anyhow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day after the Fed Presser, rising yields seem finally to have spooked &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; equity markets. 
Today we&amp;nbsp;had:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; down 3% or&amp;nbsp;more,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; down&amp;nbsp;1.3%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Huge spike down in crude: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTI&lt;/span&gt; down&amp;nbsp;7%!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Essentially all commodities&amp;nbsp;down,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UST&lt;/span&gt; 10Y now yields&amp;nbsp;1.71%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; at 91.8: it was last at this level in Nov.&amp;nbsp;2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There didn&amp;#8217;t seem any major economic news that could explain&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m reading &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/General-Semantics-Wall-Street/dp/1258154420"&gt;The General Semantics of Wall Street&lt;/a&gt; by John Magee.
It&amp;#8217;s an interesting book, now available cheaply in a Kindle edition. 
Hard copy editions sell for ~$50.
It spends a lot of time developing the idea that as concepts become more abstract, our ability to communicate using the names of them alone becomes increasingly difficult. Well, I&amp;#8217;m about half way through, and that&amp;#8217;s the main idea I&amp;#8217;ve picked up.
It certainly doesn&amp;#8217;t rush into technical&amp;nbsp;discussions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Fed Press Conference Boosts confidence</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/fed-press-conference-boosts-confidence.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-03-17T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:54+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-03-17:/fed-press-conference-boosts-confidence.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business model tweaks with Chinese characteristics.  The Wall Street Journal reports today that China’s central government will ask local authorities to change the procedure for conducting land auctions, holding them in bulk at select times during the year instead of the current piecemeal, ad hoc format.  The rationale: Simultaneous auctions will help discourage amply leveraged property developers from bidding aggressively on vacant&amp;nbsp;lots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local commentators cheered the move, with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ING&lt;/span&gt; Bank economist Iris Pang describing the move as an efficient way to freeze out undesirable industry players while Hayden Briscoe, head of Asia-Pacific fixed income at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UBS&lt;/span&gt; Asset Management, termed the policy “the final piece to the puzzle” in bringing wayward developers to heel.  Recall that the Chinese government debuted its three red lines policies, a trio of rules governing developers’ balance sheet metrics (Almost Daily Grant’s, Jan. 12), at the start of the year. Included in that trifecta: A stipulation that short-term borrowings must not exceed cash&amp;nbsp;reserves.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beijing’s efforts to whip the property sector into shape come too late for some. Bloomberg relayed on Sunday that Singapore-based City Developments Ltd. took a S$1.78 billion ($1.3 billion) writedown on its investment in mainland Chinese operator Sincere Property Group, representing a near-complete wipeout.  Sincere, which failed to repay a bond maturing last week, sported some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; 16 billion ($2.4 billion) in short-term interest-bearing liabilities as of June 2020, more than six times its reported cash holdings on that&amp;nbsp;date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Economist ran a story about the challenges of ending the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SLR&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest craze is to attach digital objects (like images) to a blockchain managed by the originator, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2757d760-c29e-4834-8636-7601adbacf47"&gt;as explained in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I am inclined to think that this is the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pets.com"&gt;pets.com&lt;/a&gt; of the current bubble. But as Kuppy always says, if you see a bubble forming, hop on it! &lt;em&gt;This is not my advice, and certainly not investment&amp;nbsp;advice.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://corporate.nordea.com/article/64215/faq-on-mmt-a-holy-grail-or-thin-air"&gt;This excellent article on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; makes the important point that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; only works as long as central bankers and treasury secretaries strongly deny publicly that what they are doing is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt;, because if they did admit they were trying &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt;, this would spook the markets.
It also makes the point that the &amp;#8220;more sovereign&amp;#8221; your currency is, the more likely you&amp;#8217;ll be able to get away with monetary financing of govt. spending without having to impose taxes to control inflation. 
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s exorbitant privilege makes them candidate number one for this experiment.
The article is well worth reading and has some good notes on Japan, which is of course, Patient Zero for all this&amp;nbsp;stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J Powell had a press conference today in which he said that the Fed had everything under control and that the Biden administration was doing just the right thing to fix the economy.
This is what the markets wanted to hear, so we had a deflationary&amp;nbsp;day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; down 0.5% to&amp;nbsp;91.4,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; equity markets strong, Asian less so (but may catch up tomorrow) and Europe&amp;nbsp;mixed,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Energy commodities down, precious metals starting to catch a bid, agricultural ones mixed; copper up over&amp;nbsp;2%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; 10Y at 1.65%, barely&amp;nbsp;changed.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Thought for the&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teleological fallacy is the false conclusion that because something serves a purpose it must have been designed to serve that purpose. 
The fact of being designed implies the existence of a conscious agent doing the design.
It is usually discussed in the context of evolution and religion, but I believe that it can be used about companies.
CEOs of successful companies will often attribute that success to their conscious shaping of the company, and their perceptiveness in understanding the market in which the company exists.
In fact, I would argue, that more often than not companies achieve their competitive advantage by natural selection, the bosses of that company being fooled by a panoply of biases: confirmation bias, availability bias and egocentric bias and probably even&amp;nbsp;groupthink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reminded of this when I read a review of Jeff Immelt&amp;#8217;s new autobiography. 
I haven&amp;#8217;t read the book, but the reviewer (in Private Eye) obviously considers Immelt to be guilty of a colossal lack of&amp;nbsp;self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Dalio has shorted bonds</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/dalio-has-shorted-bonds.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-03-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:54+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-03-16:/dalio-has-shorted-bonds.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sheer volume of posts saying &amp;#8220;inflation is coming, bonds are dead&amp;#8221; is becoming overwhelming. 
The latest is Ray Dalio, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-world-would-you-own-bonds-when-ray-dalio"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
I don&amp;#8217;t suppose he&amp;#8217;s saying anything amazingly insightful, but he controls a lot of money, and has made a lot.

Of course, many people buy bonds for reasons other than expecting a return. Central banks, certainly, but also many pension funds which are compelled to hold a large part of their investment in &amp;#8220;safe&amp;#8221; assets. 
Given that their liabilities are largely nominal, this just might work. But if the blow up is big enough, they will be bailed out, which is what my money would be on, if I could think of a way of betting on this&amp;nbsp;outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ray is worried about Elizabeth Warren going after his&amp;nbsp;wealth: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Based both on how things have worked historically and what is happening now, I am confident that tax changes will also play an important role in driving capital flows to different investment assets and different locations, and those movements will influence market movements. If history and logic are to be a guide, policy makers who are short of money will raise taxes and won’t like these capital movements out of debt assets and into other storehold of wealth assets and other tax domains so they could very well impose prohibitions against capital movements to other assets (e.g., gold, Bitcoin, etc.) and other locations. These tax changes could be more shocking than expected.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, Elizabeth Warren’s proposed wealth tax is of an unprecedented size that, based on my study of wealth taxes in other countries at other times, will most likely lead to more capital outflows and other moves to evade these taxes. The United States could become perceived as a place that is inhospitable to capitalism and capitalists. Though this specific wealth tax bill is unlikely to pass this year the chances of a sizable wealth tax bill passing over the next few years are significant. Conflicts can increase in such difficult times when accompanied by large wealth, values, and political gaps, and the environment can become inhospitable to capitalists leading them to run from less hospitable places to more hospitable&amp;nbsp;places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think this is the new&amp;nbsp;paradigm.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; For these reasons I believe a well-diversified portfolio of non-debt and non-dollar assets along with a short cash position is preferable to a traditional stock/bond mix that is heavily skewed to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; dollars. I also believe that assets in the mature developed reserve currency countries will underperform the Asian (including Chinese) emerging countries’ markets. I also believe that one should be mindful of tax changes and the possibility of capital&amp;nbsp;controls. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#8217;s also bullish about Chinese assets, like&amp;nbsp;Gavekal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Marxist interpretation of&amp;nbsp;Europe&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louis Gave has a great take on which country might be the first country to exit what is left of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;. He argues that countries make political decisions that advantage the dominant elites in those countries,&amp;nbsp;so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it won&amp;#8217;t be Germany, because their industry (the &lt;em&gt;Mittelstand&lt;/em&gt;) has benefited so much from the currency union, which protects them against the headwind of an appreciating currency when it is selling to the rest of&amp;nbsp;Europe,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it won&amp;#8217;t be France, because their ENAchs benefit so much from going to Brussels to do &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; policy making in an easily accessed and friendly setting, (with the benefit of not having to pay any of France&amp;#8217;s high&amp;nbsp;taxes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it won&amp;#8217;t be Spain, because it&amp;#8217;s elite is the coalition of large landowners who receive such generous subsidies via the Common Agricultural&amp;nbsp;Policy,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;but it might be Italy, because their industry has been destroyed by an expensive currency, imposed on them by the Germans, and these are people who have owned factories and employed local families for generations and they are thoroughly fed up of it. The establishment have played their Joker, Draghi, to give them time, but even he may not be able to hold the country together and inside of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am increasingly drawn to Marxist interpretations of economics and history, although I&amp;#8217;ve been a fan of &lt;a href="https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/"&gt;Chris Dillow&lt;/a&gt; for many years. He&amp;#8217;s always worth a read!
Gave thinks that Japanese equities are the ones to watch. That guy knows a thing or&amp;nbsp;two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure what&amp;#8217;s happening today. Energy commodities and companies have been hit hard, nothing else has moved very much.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOMC&lt;/span&gt; is meeting tomorrow. Everyone is nervous, I guess, and is taking profits on assets which have had a good run.
Retail sales in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; fell by quite a lot more than expected.
Crude inventories fell sharply (which I would have thought was bullish, but obviously I&amp;#8217;ve missed something).
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; equities, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; ones, have had a good&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>More Insanity in the USA</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/more-insanity-in-the-usa.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-03-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:54+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-03-15:/more-insanity-in-the-usa.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAD&lt;/span&gt; as petro&amp;nbsp;currency&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The sheer insanity of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;budget&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taps Coogan has pointed this out before, and I have no doubt he&amp;#8217;ll poing it again, but &lt;a href="https://thesoundingline.com/low-interest-rates-today-dont-reduce-the-governments-debt-servicing-cost-tomorrow/"&gt;the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; can never raise enough taxes to pay off the national debt or, even to realistically reduce it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we ‘need’ more than just inflation is interest rates that are lower than the inflation rate. i.e. negative real interest rates. However, negative real rates and rising nominal rates and rising inflation is the absolute worst scenario for the bond investors that are supposed to be financing the ever growing national debt. That mix represents a guaranteed loss of real wealth for bond holders. How are bond holders supposed to lend ever more money to the government while they are busy going&amp;nbsp;broke?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that reason, negative real interest rates don’t persist for long in a rising nominal rate environment without massive interventions by central banks. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt; and Bank of Japan have had to buy virtually all debt issuance from their respective governments to enforce negative nominal rates and their bond investors haven’t had to worry about rising nominal yields, at least not until&amp;nbsp;recently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BoJ has been monetizing the Japanese national debt for a long time, but it&amp;#8217;s largely held by Japanese nationals (and so is &amp;#8216;money we owe ourselves&amp;#8217; in Krugman-speak). For the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s different. While China is getting a small nominal return on the debt, it will wear it, especially as it has largely succeeded in keeping its currency down relative to the dollar.
If the inflationary impact of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; starts to leak into the exchange rate, I am not sure how long China will want to continue financing helicopter money for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/13/upshot/economy-optimism-boom.html"&gt;this article from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NY&lt;/span&gt; Times&lt;/a&gt; sort of agrees that the budget is out of control but that the real economy will be fine because at last it will start to be allowed to run hot.
It&amp;#8217;s true that the 40&amp;#8217;s, 50&amp;#8217;s and (early) 70&amp;#8217;s had pretty good growth. A collapse in bond prices would act as a phenomenal transfer of real resources to young people in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; and away from the old and Chinese (well, all holders of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; long dated&amp;nbsp;debt).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allison Reichel  &lt;a href="https://rationalreasoning.substack.com/p/is-the-economy-overheating?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMTAyMDI1LCJwb3N0X2lkIjozMjg3NzExMSwiXyI6Ik5GZksrIiwiaWF0IjoxNjE1ODI1OTM4LCJleHAiOjE2MTU4Mjk1MzgsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0yODMxMjEiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.6lpYwLcyAOZgKxHujs0L7AXeVKh5QTH-cxWvPYAJ_8s&amp;amp;utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share"&gt;agrees with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYT&lt;/span&gt; that we&amp;#8217;re going to see overheating, and that&amp;#8217;s perfectly &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; with her&lt;/a&gt;. Nobody ever writes that we are heading for deflation&amp;nbsp;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The sheer insanity of NFTs and aggregate &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;wealth&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/holy-frijoles/"&gt;Alex Manzara nails it&lt;/a&gt;.
Assets are priced at the margin. 
If one person in a million manages to get an insane price for crap, a lot of people are, on paper at least, a lot&amp;nbsp;wealthier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairly risk on/deflationary. Stimulus checks being punted on stocks on Robinhood.
Elon Musk changes his job title to &amp;#8220;Technoking&amp;#8221; or similar to distract from erosion of market share in many&amp;nbsp;markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; up, other equities also up, but by&amp;nbsp;less,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most sectors up, apart from&amp;nbsp;energy,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;commodities mainly down, because of oil, nat. gas down, as&amp;nbsp;always,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yields down a&amp;nbsp;tad,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;precious metals slightly&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The futures price for natural gas is around 0.8 cents/kWh, about 15% of the retail price. It&amp;#8217;s really extremely hard to see how any &amp;#8216;green&amp;#8217; energy source can seriously compete with this, especially in emerging markets where governments simply do not have the money to subsidize sales of&amp;nbsp;Teslas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.researchaffiliates.com/en_us/publications/articles/826-big-market-delusion-electric-vehicles.html"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; makes a compelling case that battery electric vehicle makers will as a group crash and burn.
Or, at least their share prices will.
Well, the majority, probably, unless one emerges as the dominant force in the global market.
It compares the industry to the aviation industry, which has nearly always lost money for investors, mainly because of the low barriers to entry but high (underlying) capital costs.
It of course is closest to the traditional auto industry, which has always struggled to make a good return on capital.
I don&amp;#8217;t suppose analysis like this will make a difference, until it&amp;nbsp;does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our view, today’s electric vehicle industry is a classic example of the big market delusion. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EV&lt;/span&gt; phenomenon will not change the fact that the auto industry will remain highly competitive and capital intensive, and not every company can be a winner. Further, it remains unclear how simply switching the means of auto propulsion will make the entire light &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EV&lt;/span&gt; market more profitable, an assumption the market is now currently making. We suspect that as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EV&lt;/span&gt; competition heats up, many companies will fail, as was the case in previous industry booms—whether autos, airlines, or technology—and with time the total value of the industry will recede to more reasonable&amp;nbsp;levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Kuppy&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;Konclusions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuppy has called a to in the Ponzi sector. It&amp;#8217;s a tough call. We are in the midst of Project Zimbabwe in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;, and if this succeeds then it will be followed by&amp;nbsp;#metoo &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the markets, I have been talking for months about the coming rotation out of Ponzi and into value (or
at least companies with assets and earnings). The past week has seen the spread between my two favorite
proxies for that theme, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARKK&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IWN&lt;/span&gt;, blow out dramatically. My hunch is that this continues. After a multi-
year cycle, most investors are over-exposed to Ponzi and under-exposed to real businesses. Furthermore, I’m
increasingly convinced that this week’s bounce in Ponzi was simply a dead-cat bounce, to be followed by a failed
rally—then it’s lights out for Ponzi. Especially given all the supply that keeps coming. I’m using this rally to check
my book and check it twice. Anything exposed to Ponzi simply has to go. This is about as good as it is going to
get in terms of where to exit. Remember, everyone’s definition of Ponzi is different, so there will be a lot of
fringe Ponzi names that get annihilated as well—it comes down to the shareholder base. If you love it and
cannot bring yourself to sell, at least sell some calls against—&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IV&lt;/span&gt; is stupid&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Louis Gave&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;Thesis&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pretty&amp;nbsp;simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yields on USTs have been drifting down for a year, in spite of huge equity&amp;nbsp;volatility,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USTs are no longer the &amp;#8216;anti-fragile&amp;#8217; asset which diversifies risk: in recent risk-off excursions, bond and equity prices have been positively&amp;nbsp;correlated,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; economy is being turbo charged, because of a successful vaccine roll-out and an improving economy, as reflected in equity prices, but the dollar has barely&amp;nbsp;moved,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nobody wants the dollar because the creation of dollars by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury is such that the only buyer left is the&amp;nbsp;Fed,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Fed is buying $180bln per month, even though they said they&amp;#8217;d be buying $120bln. They will never be able to reduce this: they cannot allow yields to rise any more, even though asset prices clearly are signalling&amp;nbsp;inflation,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oil and equities keep grinding higher, and this is evidence that inflation is&amp;nbsp;coming,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are bubbles everywhere: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GME&lt;/span&gt;, an infinity of&amp;nbsp;SPACs.,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yield curve control is being talked about, but is this&amp;nbsp;deliverable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;emerging markets bonds are a better options than any &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; asset, and will also provide the &amp;#8216;anti-fragile&amp;#8217;&amp;nbsp;asset,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="quo"&gt;&amp;#8216;&lt;/span&gt;the shittier the emerging market, the better it will do as the dollar falls.&amp;#8217; (The logic for this is that local investors will not deploy capital locally when local currencies are&amp;nbsp;weak),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eventually, the stresses will show up in the dollar: the Fed can stabilize USTs, but it cannot simultaneously save the&amp;nbsp;dollar,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My instinct is that Gave has a point, but &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; has rallied from 89 to 92 over the last few weeks, so the &amp;#8216;grinding higher ever single day&amp;#8217; is not borne out by the&amp;nbsp;prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://corporate.nordea.com/article/64095/fx-weekly-time-for-j-powws-taper-tantrum"&gt;Nothing to do with photography&lt;/a&gt;. Much more important.
This is a temporary relaxation on liquidity rules for banks.
It could cause a &amp;#8216;tantrum.&amp;#8217; I have only skimmed this, so don&amp;#8217;t expect the above to be a fully informed comment.

&lt;p&gt;The theory is that reflation powers small cap. A lot of these do not produce any net income, let alone a yield, which undermines my thesis that the main effect is carry costs. 
Who knows, but this is a dramatic demonstration that something is happening, probably to sentiment.

&lt;h1&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four horsemen have traditionally been the source of destruction an rebirth in societies. 
In modern times, taxes, revolution, war and raging inflation have performed the same function, of reversing the natural tendency of wealth to become increasingly concentrated in the hands of the few.
Taxes, at least redistributive ones, tend to be levied in democratic societies.
It&amp;#8217;s natural for the beneficiaries of the status quo, whether Russian, American or British, to do everything in their legal power to obstruct this.
But, too much obstruction will end in revolution, especially when the population starts to feel hungry.
Marx thought that capitalism would always be accompanied by endless accumulation of capital by the capitalist class, and that society would become endlessly unequal. 
His reasoning &lt;a href="https://article1000.com/theory-capital-accumulation/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; was that all manufacturing was a natural monopoly: economies of scale were large at the scale of markets.
Certainly, there does seem an endlessly increasing concentration in many diverse industries, from pharmaceuticals, to consumer discretionary, to advertising.
Historically, governments took muscular action to ensure active competition, but as all parties have increasingly captured by producers (whether capitalist or trade unionists), this countervailing effect has shrunk. 
In the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; capital has persuaded the Supreme Court that actual harm to consumers needs to be proven before anti-trust action will be taken.
Proving that the breakup of big, efficient supplier will produce lower prices in the short run is, of course, very difficult.
The result of this        change in the law is the slow grind towards oligopoly. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; seems hardly any&amp;nbsp;better. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>What if AI was naturally stupid?</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/what-if-ai-was-naturally-stupid.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-03-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:54+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-03-12:/what-if-ai-was-naturally-stupid.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Why are the companies that have invested insane amounts in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt;, and have terabytes of data about my interests, serve me such irrelevant&amp;nbsp;adverts?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally risk on.  10Y yields starting to rise again. Some very positive stats on the economy emerging recently.&lt;br&gt;
Reflationary trade is on again, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; down, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DJI&lt;/span&gt; and Russell up. 
Dollar gains.
Commodities generally flat, pinned down by the rise in rates and the dollar. 
Fairly quiet day in the markets.
Ponzi SPACs all still in&amp;nbsp;play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Cartoon&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The&amp;nbsp;week&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inflation: it&amp;#8217;s not here yet, but it&amp;#8217;s increasingly&amp;nbsp;expected,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; yields: rising, and with them dollar vs the&amp;nbsp;RoW,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;highly speculative, high beta plays are being picked up by retail investors: Bitcoin, SPACs, housing, fallen angels, known Ponzi&amp;nbsp;stocks,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; and other countries are seeing how the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; administration to &amp;#8220;go big&amp;#8221; appears to be working, and has defused popular anger at rising inequality, un-affordable housing, loss of personal and economic freedoms (vaccine passports, anyone?) and even identity politics&amp;nbsp;grievances,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;huge government programmes ploughing money into &amp;#8220;green jobs&amp;#8221; are universally supported. More economically rational ways to reduce &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CO&lt;/span&gt;~2~ emissions are forgotten about. Carbon pricing, permits etc. are a thing of the past. Only the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; persists in large scale carbon trading, but even that is very&amp;nbsp;incomplete,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;scientists, often working outside their original field of study, are now driving policy, with economists&amp;nbsp;sidelined,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;many senior politicians have stopped even pretending to have gone into the field to serve the&amp;nbsp;public.&lt;/li&gt;

typically involves a special license and strategies that cost&lt;br&gt;
millions of dollars to run. Rates expert Harley Bassman wants to&lt;br&gt;
do it in a low-cost exchange-traded fund.&lt;br&gt;
Bassman, who created the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MOVE&lt;/span&gt; Index to track Treasury&lt;br&gt;
volatility, is co-manager for the Simplify Credit Hedge &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
(ticker &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CDX&lt;/span&gt;), a proposed new fund that will invest up to 50% of&lt;br&gt;
its assets in credit-default swap index payer options, according&lt;br&gt;
to a filing Tuesday. Those are derivatives that allow investors&lt;br&gt;
to either hedge their position in a company’s bonds or to make a&lt;br&gt;
directional wager.&lt;br&gt;
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; is designed to pay off when turmoil hits credit&lt;br&gt;
markets. Options held by the fund can guard against widening&lt;br&gt;
spreads by offering the right to buy protection against default&lt;br&gt;
on over 100 North American and emerging-market companies.&lt;br&gt;
If that sounds complicated, it is. Previous products tied&lt;br&gt;
to default swaps have struggled to gather assets or shuttered.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CDS&lt;/span&gt; trading is normally the province of hedge funds and other&lt;br&gt;
institutional players, requiring a hard-to-get license known as&lt;br&gt;
an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISDA&lt;/span&gt; Master Agreement and a large pools of assets.&lt;br&gt;
Still, the timing may be fortuitous, with credit markets&lt;br&gt;
looking frothy and S&amp;amp;P Global Ratings warning of rising default&lt;br&gt;
risk amid unprecedented global debt issuance.&lt;br&gt;
“There’s really not many ways available in tradeable format&lt;br&gt;
to protect against the credit markets freezing,” said David&lt;br&gt;
Schawel, chief investment officer at Family Management Corp.&lt;br&gt;
“This seems to be a viable one.”&lt;br&gt;
The recent spike in Treasury yields amid rising concerns&lt;br&gt;
about inflation sparked a selloff in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; investment-grade&lt;br&gt;
credit, the worst-performing fixed income asset class this year.&lt;br&gt;
Corporate bonds with the highest credit ratings tend to have the&lt;br&gt;
most duration, making them vulnerable to rates moves. The market&lt;br&gt;
is also under pressure from excess supply.&lt;br&gt;
In addition to swap index options, the Simplify fund will&lt;br&gt;
invest in Treasuries, inflation-protected securities, money-&lt;br&gt;
market funds and investment-grade corporate debt via ETFs,&lt;br&gt;
according to the filing. It’s expected to cost 0.5% a year.&lt;br&gt;
Bassman is a famous industry figure, having specialized in&lt;br&gt;
fixed-income derivatives and structured products during his 26-&lt;br&gt;
year career at Merrill Lynch, according to his personal website.&lt;br&gt;
He later worked at Credit Suisse Group &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AG&lt;/span&gt; and Pimco before&lt;br&gt;
joining&amp;nbsp;Simplify.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troubled&amp;nbsp;History  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund is the latest in a list of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CDS&lt;/span&gt; products, most of&lt;br&gt;
which have faltered.&lt;br&gt;
The ProShares &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CDS&lt;/span&gt; North American High Yield Credit &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
launched in 2014, but liquidated a few years later after&lt;br&gt;
struggling to attract assets. In Europe, the Tabula North&lt;br&gt;
American &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CDX&lt;/span&gt; High Yield Credit Short fund (ticker &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TABS&lt;/span&gt;) holds&lt;br&gt;
less than $1 million after launching in July. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DWS&lt;/span&gt; Investments&lt;br&gt;
recently reduced the number of credit derivative ETFs it offers&lt;br&gt;
through its XTrackers label to three from a peak of 15 in 2012.&lt;br&gt;
“This &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; will have its work cut out for it competing with&lt;br&gt;
the massively liquid options on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HYG&lt;/span&gt;, which many currently use as&lt;br&gt;
way to hedge credit risk or bet against it,” said Eric Balchunas&lt;br&gt;
of Bloomberg Intelligence, referring to the $22 billion iShares&lt;br&gt;
iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Even though the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CDS&lt;/span&gt; market is largely inaccessible to&lt;br&gt;
individual investors right now, it’s unclear if retail traders&lt;br&gt;
would even want exposure to default swaps, he added.&lt;br&gt;
While more tactical investors may trade in and out of the&lt;br&gt;
product, there are long stretches of middling performance&lt;br&gt;
associated with such instruments, which are designed to pay out&lt;br&gt;
only in a crisis.&lt;br&gt;
“Shorting credit is easier said than done,” said Peter&lt;br&gt;
Tchir, head of macro strategy at Academy Securities. “It will be&lt;br&gt;
interesting to see if this mix of tools available to the&lt;br&gt;
managers can be harnessed to deliver returns.”&lt;br&gt;
The end result may be that the fund occupies a niche&lt;br&gt;
similar to its underlying strategy, despite the easy access of&lt;br&gt;
an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; wrapper.&lt;br&gt;
“While likely more complicated initially for retail&lt;br&gt;
investors, this fund could appeal to institutions,” said Todd&lt;br&gt;
Rosenbluth, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CFRA&lt;/span&gt;’s director of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;research.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supply and demand for labour is a difficult thing to measure. Unemployment and workforce participation can move in the same direction. There is usually between a third and a half of the workforce of most developed economies which are not in paid employment, which suggests a terrible lack of demand. On the other hand employers constantly complain about the difficulties of recruiting people, especially people to do badly paid jobs like fruit picking. The labour market may be more difficult to quantify than the market for crude oil or copper, but it is probably more important.

&lt;h2&gt;More&amp;nbsp;junk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Grant&amp;#8217;s Almost Daily&amp;nbsp;newsletter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beat goes on in 2021. Following the record $433 billion of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; junk bond issuance last year (up a cool 57% from the prior annum), it’s been a gangbuster start to the year for high-yield, as domestic new supply footed to $37.3 billion in February according to S&amp;amp;P’s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCD&lt;/span&gt; unit.  That’s within a hair of the all-time February issuance record of $37.5 billion, set in 2012 (when the 10-year note yielded 1.97% and spreads on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BAML&lt;/span&gt; High Yield Index stood at 598 basis points, compared to 1.4% and 357 basis points, respectively, this year).   In tandem with a monster $51.8 billion January, the two-month issuance total topped last year’s equivalent, pre-pandemic period by&amp;nbsp;31%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As companies line up to finance themselves, worrying signs accumulate. The yield-to-worst on the Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Index reached 4.45% yesterday, up from a record low 3.89% three weeks ago.  That abrupt shift is spurring some investors to head for the hills. Bloomberg’s Lisa Abramowicz relays that the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HYG&lt;/span&gt; on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYSE&lt;/span&gt; Arca), the largest such junk bond fund, suffered a hefty $2 billion outflow over the past week, leaving assets below $21 billion for the first time since last&amp;nbsp;May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It&amp;#8217;s just another drug the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury is on&amp;nbsp;…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="![df86e4ccb6e28330d2b3590c18c46f22.png](df86e4ccb6e28330d2b3590c18c46f22.png)"&gt;https://thesoundingline.com/just-a-reminder-the-fed-needs-to-double-its-qe-program/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; was all about shuffling T Bond holdings between commercial banks and the Fed. Unsurprisingly, although because of the technical definition of money, this increased the money supply, it didn&amp;#8217;t make much difference to inflation. Now we have a situation where the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Federal Govt. is running large deficits, which need to be financed by someone, and neither the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; private investor nor Japan, nor China, nor Europe is willing to step up to the plate. The result will be a huge increase in Fed assets, again, getting on for an additional $3 trillion. The public welcomes this spending with open arms. It is hard to see it being reversed at any time any Democrat federal level politician needs to get elected, which is basically&amp;nbsp;never. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Healthcare is an object lesson to the world on how not to keep citizens healthy at an affordable&amp;nbsp;price&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/10/upshot/covid-bill-health-gap.html"&gt;This story&lt;/a&gt; reveals that an extremely marginal differential diagnosis of Covid-19 was the only thing between a guy being bankrupted and having his treatment free. Only the providers of healthcare can possibly benefit from such a dysfunctional system. But they are extremely powerful, politically. And that&amp;#8217;s all that&amp;nbsp;matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Authers, whom I read much less often now he&amp;#8217;s defected to Bloomberg, wrote a fairly long piece about bond yields, inflation, etc. I seem to recall that it made all the standard points. One thing it did discuss was the 10Y Treasury yield going above the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; dividend yield. A lot of commentators attributed the drop in long duration stocks (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt;) to the higher discount rate on dividends/cashflows this implied. I just find it hard to believe that this could even be estimated, let alone have such a consensus that it moved the market.
Authers made the point that this means that funding an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; position with 10Y Treasuries now has a positive carrying cost. I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure that the marginal buyer is a hedge fund and so is leveraged, so this makes sense. Whether 10Y is the right metric is another matter. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LIBOR&lt;/span&gt; is still a lot lower.  But the insight that leverage is a big factor, and that this is the mechanism through which risk free rates impact equity prices is a very sound one, I think.  It certainly implies why a dealer would be more comfortable holding an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XOM&lt;/span&gt; position, with a dividend yield of 8% vs a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; one with a yield (dividend, free cashflow, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EBITDA&lt;/span&gt;, earnings: you name it) of&amp;nbsp;zero. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dividend yields are only one side of the story. Many companies choose to spend more money on share buybacks, to offset the dilution created by equity-based compensation to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; and his board, but these are more variable, and so maybe it&amp;#8217;s legitimate to give them less weight than dividend yield in estimating carry&amp;nbsp;costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One effect that we will soon start to see in official stats is the huge drop in some prices dropping out of the computation of year-on-year changes. This is probably going to give headline inflation rates which are scary. In theory, nothing in this should surprise markets, but if labour unions start to fight for wage increases in the same order of magnitude, something which is a statistical artifact may leak into a real economic&amp;nbsp;event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy has done extremely well over the last six months, vastly outperforming tech, but over the last five years it has done very badly. It&amp;#8217;s not clear if the fact that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESG&lt;/span&gt;-sensitive fund managers moving savings away from fossil fuels will result in a drop of returns for investors. Arguably, once the change of investing strategy is in the price, the returns on oil company shares will have to be higher to draw funds from the now-depleted pool of savings. One way to do this might be via going long the Russian Ruble. Oil stocks can be pumped and dumped, but it&amp;#8217;s difficult to do this with a currency, and the Russian central bank is widely acknowledged to be very well&amp;nbsp;run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump had trade deals with China. Biden has passing of the stimulus bill. Today was Biden actually signing a bit of paper. How that changes anything in the real economy is beyond me, but that&amp;#8217;s what makes a market. Several items of positive international&amp;nbsp;news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; equities strongly&amp;nbsp;up,&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m quite bullish on energy. 
Commodities have been weak for a long time, and the biggest (&amp;#8216;consumable&amp;#8217;) commodity of oil is oil.
The relatively strong dollar has held down commodity prices, and it has weakened, but now it&amp;#8217;s going back up again.
Short dollar is supposedly the most crowded trade in the universe, so it&amp;#8217;s easy to imagine all those dollar shorts covering as the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; rises again, spiking the oil rally, and with it prices of downstream oil&amp;nbsp;producers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Added to all this is the massive capital injection into &amp;#8216;green&amp;#8217; energy. Even if wind power ends up costing ten times the price of energy from oil, this is not necessarily a reason that we don&amp;#8217;t end up using it, because all governments agree that free markets are fine, as long as they are not used for important goods and&amp;nbsp;services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remain convinced that $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;XOM&lt;/span&gt; is a better bet than $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;, but I am not sure that I&amp;#8217;d want to go out very far on that particular limb, given the huge political and geopolitical risks which may affect both&amp;nbsp;stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Bonds&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="359e6f109b00f2ad2d655ca09411a573.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/359e6f109b00f2ad2d655ca09411a573.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten year yields are lagging developed markets &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PMI&lt;/span&gt; surveys. Both should be strongly correlated with future&amp;nbsp;inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Grant is gloomy about&amp;nbsp;bonds&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury has to raise a lot of money, but without spooking bond markets. Things could get interesting, but for sure the primary dealers are going to try to shake out the bond shorts before the&amp;nbsp;auctions!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://www.grantspub.com/resources/commentary.cfm"&gt;Grant&amp;#8217;s Almost Daily Commentary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buckle up: A potentially pivotal week is in store for fixed-income investors, as the Treasury department is set to auction a total of $120 billion across 3-, 10- and 30-year matures between Tuesday and Thursday. Recall that the disastrous Feb. 25 auction of $62 billion worth of seven-year notes, featuring a yield well above the when issued price along with the weakest bid-to-cover ratio on record, helped catalyze a sharp selloff in Treasurys. Currently the 10- and 30-year yields remain at their highest since the pandemic got&amp;nbsp;underway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, signs of stirring inflation (including a 25% year-over-year bulge in M2 money supply), in tandem with a Federal Reserve actively striving for higher consumer prices, present a daunting backdrop for would-be Treasury holders in the context of a near 40-year bull market. “Until investors are comfortable knowing the Fed’s tolerance for higher rates, it is unlikely that most buyers will want to ‘catch a falling knife’ for higher yields,” Meghan Swiber, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; rates strategist at Bank of America, tells the Financial&amp;nbsp;Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One fundamental gauge suggests Uncle Sam’s creditors may have reason for worry.  Bloomberg notes this afternoon that, with economist consensus calling for a 7.6% advance in nominal output this year, the 600 basis point gap between &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; expectations and the 10-year Treasury yield is at its widest since&amp;nbsp;1966. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Trading&amp;nbsp;Economics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street rallied on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones up more than 200 points after hitting another intraday record and the S&amp;amp;P 500 rising 2% as investors focus on prospects of a strong economic recovery and further stimulus. The House is expected to pass the $1.9 trillion aid bill tomorrow. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq added more than 4% after sinking into correction territory the day before, as Treasury yields retreated ahead of sales in the coming days and tech shares recovered some ground. Tesla stocks outperformed and surged almost 20%, rebounding from a 5.8% drop on Monday as upbeat China car sales data offered some support. Since hitting an all-time high on January 26th, the firm has shed a third of its&amp;nbsp;value.&lt;/p&gt;

A lot of mainstream press is suddenly saying &amp;#8220;Whoa, why are interest rates going up?

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones surged more than 600 points to a fresh all-time high on Monday as investors focus on prospects of a global economic recovery and progress towards fiscal stimulus and shrug off stubbornly high Treasury yields. The Senate approved President Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus bill on Saturday and the House is seen passing it on Tuesday while Treasury Secretary Yellen said she doesn&amp;#8217;t see the new aid package causing an inflationary problem. Comments from David Tepper, founder of Appaloosa Management, also helped to lift investors&amp;#8217; mood. Tepper said it’s very difficult to be bearish on stocks right now and thinks the sell-off in Treasuries that has driven rates higher is likely over. Meanwhile, the S&amp;amp;P 500 was up almost 1% while the Nasdaq struggled to book gains as rising rates are set to hurt companies relying on easy-borrowing and lead to less favourable valuation models for some hot technology&amp;nbsp;shares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;bond yields up, but not materially: 10Y at&amp;nbsp;1.6%,&lt;/li&gt;

These stocks, along with Tesla and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARKK&lt;/span&gt; have been relentlessly pumped on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNBC&lt;/span&gt; and are finally coming down towards the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPV&lt;/span&gt; of their&amp;nbsp;dividends.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/the-real-reasons-children-are-going-hungry"&gt;The real reason kids are going hungry&lt;/a&gt;, according to Rod Liddle, is that changes to the economic structure of society have resulted in a huge change in the role of women in the past generation or two. He particularly identifies the downgrading of the role of fathers in bringing up their own children.

Their implied vols (~0.8%) back that up.

These levered short products have terrible rebalancing risk, and really are not suitable for taking a long term view, but for a short term punt they are tailor-made for the RobinHood&amp;nbsp;crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sheer number of articles and charts pointing out the rise in inflation is enough to convince ordinary workers that it is coming, 
which in turn might be enough to support industrial action to increase their wages.
In the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, although health care workers were exempted from the pay freeze imposed on the rest of the public sector, they are planning to strike over the current 1% pay offer. I think they are well paid by the standards of most workers in the private sector, but I strongly support their strike action, because escalating wages in the public sector will eventually push up wages in the private sector. 
This is &amp;#8216;trickle down economics&amp;#8217; that really&amp;nbsp;works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://email.mail.themarketear.com/c/eJxdjsuOwyAMRb8GlpExtMCCRR7tbLuaPUkcpWroA1Dn9-uOuqpkyTrW8bXnYJUheQ4IqEDDDrWyuGtUczSDGfTB7MHZw9CBMJDieWvqSinmC1WKuZluSa5hjt7jaI1dNLCOGnEc4zTOakHjaJEp-L0HJ7ew1novQrcCj1zfWTy630ot3KfSdz-_5fS4yhxKpSfxA3G6lJj-r9bAUha9F20r-k4493yD92_wwBHuw-g3VnnhSn9lo1opvwDZ5EfB" title="Is Bitcoin a Giffen Good?"&gt;Is Bitcoin a Giffen Good?&lt;/a&gt; 
Long thought piece from &amp;#8220;strat star&amp;#8221; Inigo at&amp;nbsp;Bernstein: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The recent rapid price increase of bitcoin begs the question: does scale beget acceptance and make bitcoin behave like a Giffen good where demand and price are positively correlated? We think that bitcoin fails the technical test for a Giffen good in that any positive link between price and demand does not derive from an income effect. What could drive a positive link, however, is the fact that as it grows in scale then other assets become less good substitutes. The main source of demand for bitcoin as a potential store of value in institutional portfolios is the belief that we are in a new policy world where debasement risk is real. An increase in the market cap of bitcoin removes barriers and gives it the aura of apparently being a more “mature” asset and also, crucially, implies implicit acceptance from lawmakers despite concerns, for example about its role in money laundering. However, there are two aspects that threaten a negative link between scale and demand. The first is bitcoin&amp;#8217;s status as arguably the most anti-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESG&lt;/span&gt; assets imaginable (alongside SPACs perhaps). Increased scale would worsen the power-consumption problem for questionable social utility. The other potential risk is if bitcoin was a risk to the implementation of monetary policy. This is a distant prospect at present but is a non-linear function of its scale. It seems ludicrous to talk about an investment product as having a positive relationship between demand and price (aren&amp;#8217;t we meant to buy low and sell high?) However, in the near-term to the extent that scale implies more acceptance, then such a link could be possible. We think that a fundamental valuation of bitcoin is impossible and reject claims for such a narrative, e.g. by assuming a given pool of investors allocate a certain proportion of capital to it. However, comparing it to such asset pools can be instructive for scaling. The value of bitcoin is approaching half the value of gold held for investment purposes. Maybe this is not a basis for argument but as it approaches the same size as gold thesis creep will occur. We are not ready to claim that an asset that has been accepted for a couple of years is better than one that has been accepted for 5000 years. We are still at an early stage in the institutional adoption of crypto in asset allocation. We think its use can grow but it does warrant a discussion of the link between price and demand for this asset&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;|&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Budget&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chancellor promised to balance the budget, but kept a lot of pandemic support going.
He provided accelerated capital allowances, which should help deploy some of the recent excess saving into productive assets.
He pumped up the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; housing market again (it&amp;#8217;s a tradition that every budget speech must have some sort of bung for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; housebuilders).
The threatened increases in rates of capital gains tax were missing.
He froze tax free allowances: it seems a reasonable assumption that his economists predicted a general increase in wage levels sufficient to make this worth doing, which is nice.
He put off the fuel duty escalator again (this is a very long standing tradition in budget speeches, going back probably to the time of William&amp;nbsp;Gladstone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it probably could have been worse. Inflation is pretty muted, there has to be a massive output gap, even in our inflation-prone economy.
We shall see how things pan out, but gilts barely moved, which suggests that hedge funds are not too&amp;nbsp;worried.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Alex Manzara on Fed&amp;nbsp;Mistakes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has &lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/fed-transitory-market-not-transitory/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; to say about what is happening in the fixed income market currently.
It&amp;#8217;s worth reading, as the weekend post always has a bit more to digest than the weekday ones. 
My attempt at a&amp;nbsp;summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Fed is like an elephant: it never forgets its mistakes or repeats&amp;nbsp;them,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it always learns the wrong lesson of the&amp;nbsp;past,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&amp;#8217;s counting on a spike of inflation soon as transitory, but in his view it is&amp;nbsp;not,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eurodollar options are getting pricier, indicating that the market is demanding more downside&amp;nbsp;protection,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shorting Treasuries is not for the fainthearted, because the Fed has many ways of screwing up your&amp;nbsp;trade,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SLR&lt;/span&gt; exemption (some relaxation of liquidity rules for banks introduced about about a year ago to support the Treasury market) will expire at the end of this month, but he expects that some equivalent regulation will be put in place to offset its impact and support&amp;nbsp;prices,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supply issues in commodities will feed into inflation as well as demand boosted by the various fiscal&amp;nbsp;measures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, then, like about a hundred commentators this weekend, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt; expects yields to rise. Unlike them, he&amp;#8217;s much more awake to the possibility that the obvious trades to take advantage of this may end up losing&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>SOX getting soggy</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/sox-getting-soggy.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-03-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:54+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-03-05:/sox-getting-soggy.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;

(&amp;#8216;No bid&amp;#8217; is usually used to describe a market for securities where no market maker will buy the securities you want to sell. Obviously, in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt;, there are no market makers: all participants are equivalent. Increasingly, in &amp;#8216;real&amp;#8217; securities markets the distinction is breaking&amp;nbsp;down.)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;It was revealed that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; spent £37 bln on a Track and Trace system that simply doesn&amp;#8217;t work. But at least the whole thing was run by a chum of David Cameron, so it&amp;#8217;s not too&amp;nbsp;bad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greensill, founded by Lex Greensill, another chum of David Cameron, is in administration. David Cameron (again) was heavily involved in setting it up and handing it government contracts. Sadly, his share options will now expire&amp;nbsp;worthless.&lt;/li&gt;

    8. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; should sag (the world consensus, except Brent Johnson),
    9. gold will trend down as real yields go up (production function, deflation, deficits),
    10. Treasuries will wilt under the weight of the deficits they have to&amp;nbsp;fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m on board with all this, except perhaps gold. If real yields go up, so will the real cost of govt. debt financing, which will mean politically difficult tax rises. 
My money is probably on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CB&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s finally igniting inflation, but they&amp;#8217;ve been spectacularly bad at doing this in the recent past. 
Govt.s could do it, but the short term spike in nominal rates might kill&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="bf75d011816db413785af3147e20ea0a.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/bf75d011816db413785af3147e20ea0a.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The correctness of this view has been combined into a composite chart. You&amp;#8217;ll have to read Thomas&amp;#8217; post for details. The thesis is that this view came right in about April&amp;nbsp;2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Bitcoin Satoshi&amp;nbsp;Vision&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dabble in a tiny, tiny way in cryptocurrencies. I like the idea of a distributed ledger with a democratic process for agreeing and confirming transactions. I also like the fact that it relies on public key encryption. I also like the idea that it was invented by a guy, who remains anonymous but is now semi-trillionaire, who made up an obviously fake name from bits of well known Japanese appliance&amp;nbsp;manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#8217;s clear that in their current form, the vast bulk of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies are unusably slow.
The cause of this is small blocks, and one currency, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BSV&lt;/span&gt;, tries to fix that with … big blocks!
The result will be a less distributed ledger, but much quicker confirmation times, and throughput of transactions.
The currency that delivers this is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BSV&lt;/span&gt;. 
It&amp;#8217;s hard to have a huge (and endlessly growing) blocksize and at the same time let everyone run a full node on his &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt;.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BSV&lt;/span&gt; tradeoff is to have fewer and more centralized servers, which means that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BSV&lt;/span&gt; is not so good for money laundering or buying drugs, but if it is ever going to be usable in the way that was originally envisaged, I can&amp;#8217;t see any alternative.
Buying &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BSV&lt;/span&gt; seems tricky: Coinbase doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to support it. I have done the most cursory of&amp;nbsp;checks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out more about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BSV&lt;/span&gt; checkout &lt;a href="https://unboundedcapital.com/"&gt;Unbounded Capital&lt;/a&gt;. 
I should warn that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BSV&lt;/span&gt; is very, very controversial. Many bitcoiners despise the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BSV&lt;/span&gt; crowd as heretics and want them burned at the stake. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BSV&lt;/span&gt; certainly has low volume, and it&amp;#8217;s capability of processing many transactions clearly makes it more vulnerable to attack by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSA&lt;/span&gt; and/or the&amp;nbsp;Kremlin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Unionization&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Krugman wrote a newsletter commenting on how Joe Biden had implicitly encouraged workers at Amazon to unionize.
He reviewed why it was that union membership in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; private had cratered, in a way that was not replicated in Denmark (or Canada).
He concluded that it was because union-hostile Republican administrations had been in power for too long.
It seems a bit simplistic, but he has a point.
In the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, we&amp;#8217;ve had a mix of Labour and Conservative, but the Blairism was as hostile to unions as Thatcherism.
It&amp;#8217;s hard to see the pendulum swinging back here, even if we get a Starmer govt., but it might just happen under Johnson, as he cares more about winning elections than being ideologically&amp;nbsp;pure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap (~20:30&amp;nbsp;gmt)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another inflationary&amp;nbsp;day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All major indexes down, although some rallying towards the&amp;nbsp;close,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; stocks hammered, except $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FB&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;too,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; up, to 91.6: on increased yields. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt; market is ignoring inflation. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; down 4.9%, in spite of the fact that everyone sees it as an inflation hedge (&amp;#8220;digital&amp;nbsp;gold&amp;#8221;),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bonds yields up, 10Y by 7bp, to&amp;nbsp;1.54,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hydrocarbons all up (crude by 4.57%, to 64.1, except gas (down&amp;nbsp;2.5%),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most ag. commods down, except&amp;nbsp;soybeans,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gold &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; copper both down heavily (copper by&amp;nbsp;4.7%).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main news today&amp;nbsp;was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OPEC&lt;/span&gt; which seems to have agreed to keep production unchanged in&amp;nbsp;April,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Powell giving some testimony, saying that he&amp;#8217;ll let inflation rip (well, I don&amp;#8217;t think he actually said that, but that&amp;#8217;s how the market&amp;nbsp;reacted).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARKK&lt;/span&gt;, the Ark &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt;, which is down 5.7%, and was down further. It&amp;#8217;s an active portfolio, but the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; sponsor agrees to replicate the portfolio as held by Crazy Cathie.
Everyone expects her to reduce the more liquid stocks first, which will simply add volatility and illiquidity to the remaining portfolio, making it more and more vulnerable to a selling attack.
With bitcoin down quite a bit, the crypto equities were hit. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSTR&lt;/span&gt; is down nearly 13%.
The market will probably recover, but today will have shaken out some of the&amp;nbsp;RobinHooders.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Financial Repression on the way</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/financial-repression-on-the-way.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-03-03T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:54+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-03-03:/financial-repression-on-the-way.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks often blame bouts of illiquidity on post-crisis regulations constraining their ability to make markets, and the influx of high-speed, algorithmic traders in Treasuries. These firms might keep trading cheaper and more efficient in normal times, but they tend to pull back when turmoil erupts, some asset managers say. “They make up such a large share of the order book depth that when it is decimated as it was, there is no other conclusion to draw other than the fact that they either pulled back significantly or widened their bid/offers,” said Gladchun at Loomis Sayles. The turbulence has heightened concerns about what may happen if regulators do not extend a Covid-triggered exception for Treasuries and cash reserves when it comes to calculating how much extra capital banks need to hold. A political battle recently escalated over the concessions, which were extended in part to help banks absorb selling pressures and are set to expire this month. Some experts say that further measures may also be needed to shore up the market that acts as a benchmark for trillions of dollars in assets. “For the world’s so-called risk-free asset — the asset which is supposed to be the one that protects us every single time — the fact that this is happening should be horrifying,” said Yesha Yadav, a professor focused on Treasury market reform at Vanderbilt Law School. “Regulators have a lot to do&amp;nbsp;here.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PMI&lt;/span&gt; had a big miss.  Fairly heavy falls in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;stocks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; up, 90.9&amp;nbsp;now,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almost all govt. bonds have higher yields, typically half a dozen&amp;nbsp;bps.,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commodities mixed: oil up, because of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OPEC&lt;/span&gt; meeting tomorrow, everything else down, incl. precious&amp;nbsp;metals,&lt;/li&gt;

Never forget that an investment bank wants transaction flow and the commissions that follow from them, much more than it wants you to get rich.  For a follow up hatchet job on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; Alphaville, read &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/499f5f48-59ca-43a9-8c3a-c6859a05c80c"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. Believe me, you won&amp;#8217;t regret&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DoorDash ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DASH&lt;/span&gt;) has come to the end of its lockin period. Expect insiders to sell. &lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An uncomfortable question for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DASH&lt;/span&gt; bulls: Might the third-party delivery model be fundamentally flawed? One legacy player’s experience could prove instructive. Domino’s Pizza &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CFO&lt;/span&gt; Stuart Levy declared on last week’s earnings call that: “In 60 years, we’ve never made a dollar delivering a pizza.  We make money on the product, but we don’t make money on the delivery. So, we’re just not sure how others do&amp;nbsp;it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Sears &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Roebuck never made money, even though they were the Amazon of their day. Amazon likewise makes no money on its retail sales side. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;B2C&lt;/span&gt; is a tough&amp;nbsp;gig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sarkozy has been convicted of corruption in public office. Why can&amp;#8217;t the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; ever manage this. Oh, I forgot, because nobody could ever commit such a crime&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some rotation since 10 Feb into value sectors. Note how much $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACWI&lt;/span&gt; (cap weighted global equities) has performed so well. Suggestion is that European equities are due for a rerating. This chart has reversed somewhat over the last few days. From &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TME&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Accounting Problems at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SCI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service Corporation International&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYSE&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SCI&lt;/span&gt; — $8.09 billion), a funeral and cemetery company, received two &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEC&lt;/span&gt; comment letters and held two phone calls with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEC&lt;/span&gt; staff according to comment letters made public last&amp;nbsp;week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEC&lt;/span&gt; comment letter &lt;a href="https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJxVkUGOhCAQRU_T7DSAQOOCxWzmGgSwVDKKBsruePvBdjGZhFRI6lf9n1fBIUxbPs2-FSRXsXjuYBK8ywKIkMlRINs4GCFYr6gg9TcwLTWJxY4ZYHVxMZgPIPvhlxgcxi1dA1xprslsAoDoQHAp5Oil99qF3sm-D08GQJm6bd0xREgBzJaW87OYLGZG3Muj-3rw7_rCtq6Q8M71E9PUlsMXdOGnra0q2P9Eza1qLlnDmxJic57NvgQg0XDKGe0o45Tyjres5d4zEGoEpbV0tEZVfe-G0SvwI1fjQ9B14v_sSDYF4QXtDGv1eLuziqYLxqdbWdgrypEinhaS8wsMNya8YX_A2QkS5HqEwTo0TDGhuO6lYoreWCrHrmP8yaQk1X7Y6lQyOIMHl4N7wS-_t5ku"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, in&amp;nbsp;part,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In discussing your trust investments on page 40, you also state that your market-sensitive instruments and positions are considered to be ‘other-than-trading’. Please tell us how you concluded the cash flows related to your trust investments represent operating activities, rather than investing&amp;nbsp;activities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 19,036-word response (inclusive of exhibits) the company&amp;nbsp;wrote,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our financial reporting for preneed funeral and cemetery contracts with customers has been the subject of significant research, deliberation, consultation, and discussion with the Staff and the Office of the Chief Accountant over the last 15 years. State laws generally require… funds collected for preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and service contracts to be placed into merchandise and service trusts… The Trusts hold investments in marketable securities that we have generally considered&amp;nbsp;other-than-trading…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SCI&lt;/span&gt; later made small changes to its accounting “based on further conversation with the [&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEC&lt;/span&gt;]&amp;nbsp;Staff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comment letters are public informal correspondence between public companies and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEC&lt;/span&gt; about accounting or disclosure issues. Other companies with notable recent comment letters include &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JOYY&lt;/span&gt; Inc&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASDAQ&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YY&lt;/span&gt; — $9.55 billion), a Chinese video-based social media platform, and &lt;strong&gt;The Children’s Place, Inc&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASDAQ&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLCE&lt;/span&gt; — $1.01 billion), a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;retailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why do people buy T&amp;nbsp;Bonds?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attempted to answer this &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lw00tg/who_tf_is_buying_bonds/gpeomd4"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I occasionally post on Reddit, but this was a bit longer, and I thought it was worth sharing.
I do believe that bonds are a bad bet, but I am not naive enough to believe that there are no good reasons for buying&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Largely a day of reversals. It&amp;#8217;s very unclear what is happening. The long rally in commodities seems to have stalled.
Bonds are catching a bid.
Equity markets were weaker, again, with all the major &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; indices falling, including the Nasdaq. None are up more than 3.5% on the year (the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt;) and all are lagging the major Euro markets, some of which are up over&amp;nbsp;10%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although ethanol rocketed over 5%, the more conventional hydrocarbon commodities were all down or flat. (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, I&amp;#8217;m a chemist. I know that ethanol is not a hydrocarbon!)
Grains and precious metals moved up together. 
Generally, commodities benefited from a weaker&amp;nbsp;dollar.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>St David’s Day Post</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/st-davids-day-post.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-03-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:53+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-03-01:/st-davids-day-post.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Stocks and&amp;nbsp;Bonds&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The so-called &amp;#8216;Fed Model&amp;#8217; of the stock market says that you can just compare the dividend yield (or free cashflow yield, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EBITDA&lt;/span&gt; yield etc.) with bond yields, to get a handle on what the stock market is doing. So, if yields fall, the stockmarket goes up (because …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Stocks and&amp;nbsp;Bonds&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="c48fcd36b5b5db9e6e163f9037cadd77.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/c48fcd36b5b5db9e6e163f9037cadd77.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called &amp;#8216;Fed Model&amp;#8217; of the stock market says that you can just compare the dividend yield (or free cashflow yield, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EBITDA&lt;/span&gt; yield etc.) with bond yields, to get a handle on what the stock market is doing. So, if yields fall, the stockmarket goes up (because net incomes of companies are relatively stable).
As this chart, from the Market Ear, makes it clear, extreme moves in yields &lt;em&gt;in either direction&lt;/em&gt; provoke large negative returns for&amp;nbsp;equities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the Fed model sort of works most of the time. Equities and bonds have gone up in tandem, with the 60:40 portfolio blunting the edge of risk off events in the equity markets with spikes of divergence between the asset classes. But this works while we do not have big moves, and yet Janet Yellen has already promised that this is the time for government to &amp;#8220;go big.&amp;#8221; Going big means spiking inflation expectations, which spikes yield&amp;nbsp;moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taps Coogan has written &lt;a href="https://thesoundingline.com/a-paradigm-shift-we-have-finally-reached-the-limit-of-endless-stimulus/"&gt;another excellent piece about the Fed, balance sheet expansion and inflation&lt;/a&gt;. In this he points out that increasing Fed assets cannot simultaneously be the cure and the cause of the disease of rising inflation. Although J Powell has denied it, everyone seems to expect the Fed to start yield curve control to offset the rise of yields on long-dated Treasurys. They have followed the Japanese playbook slavishly so far: why would the diverge now? Well, it has been tried before, with mixed&amp;nbsp;results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people say that deflation will still happen because the Fed can&amp;#8217;t affect wages. A supplementary reason is that many states are deeply insolvent and simply don&amp;#8217;t have nearly enough money to pay their pensioners and employees. Somehow, I think that some way will be found to inject dollars into the accounts of these people. Real resources … that may be more&amp;nbsp;tricky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="8810a70c5b9052c58b0cdbe175575afb.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/8810a70c5b9052c58b0cdbe175575afb.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Rosenberg &lt;a href="https://themarket.ch/interview/were-getting-closer-to-a-breaking-point-ld.3681"&gt;thinks that after an initial surge the need to reduce deficits will kill any economic recovery&lt;/a&gt;.  He&amp;#8217;s bullish on long-dated Treasuries, and on Chinese equities (and related Far East assets). He also prefers banks to bitcoin (me too!) and reckons that yield curve flattening will not flatten their appeal.
I&amp;#8217;m not convinced, but he&amp;#8217;s a very smart fellow, and has been right in the&amp;nbsp;past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Realpolitik&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Haas, previously director of Policy Planning at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; State Dept. &lt;a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/us-saudi-relations-after-khashoggi-intelligence-report-by-richard-haass-2021-02"&gt;explains that signalling to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MBS&lt;/span&gt; that you are an ally of his by dropping some bombs on people in Syria who might be linked to Iran is a perfectly understandable and normal diplomatic move&lt;/a&gt;, and that the only difference between &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MBS&lt;/span&gt; and Putin is that the former is rather more effective at killing his political enemies than the latter. Oh, and of course noboby would criticize the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; for not criticizing Putin.
Well, it&amp;#8217;s depressing, but it&amp;#8217;s probably&amp;nbsp;accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Manzara blasts Brad&amp;nbsp;Sherman&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex Mazara is a technical specialist. His blog is about changes in a few basis points of yield levels between adjacent maturities in the T Bill futures curve.
It&amp;#8217;s all the more astonishing that he does such an excellent demolition job on politicians, &lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/mr-market-questions-the-fed/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The point is that the politicians have no understanding of markets or economics, and will be clueless when the wheels come off the economy.
Just read the blog. It&amp;#8217;s excellent (as the weekend ones always&amp;nbsp;are).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Inflation, since&amp;nbsp;1913&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div class="embed-container"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=BtFu&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/js/embed.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inflation was pretty wild in the first few decades of the last century, and spiked up regularly after wars subsequently.  We haven&amp;#8217;t had a war in a long time, but we&amp;#8217;ve (globally) spent a lot of resources on paying people to sit at home watching Netflix. This may just tilt the&amp;nbsp;balance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard to classify. The $1.9B stimulus bill galvanized nearly all&amp;nbsp;assets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bonds&amp;nbsp;up,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;equities up (virtually globally, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; by&amp;nbsp;~3%),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; up 2.9%, Russell 2000 3.6%. Best day for&amp;nbsp;ages,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All sectors up, max tech, least real estate. Energy did quite well, but oil was down 1.7%. No, I have no idea why&amp;nbsp;either.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; up&amp;nbsp;0.2%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the virtual certainty of this bill being passed, one has to wonder what on earth was the real driver of this rally. The fact remains, though that over 5 days, the market hasn&amp;#8217;t really moved much&amp;nbsp;either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strength in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Dollar is going to be a big headwind for commodities. They&amp;#8217;ve had a great time (except gold, of course), and everyone is bullish on them. 
But that&amp;#8217;s not the time to be getting into a long&amp;nbsp;position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not researched any of these. The list is really for me to take a look at&amp;nbsp;tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Successful&amp;nbsp;policies&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s really almost impossible to reverse a policy which had the effect of giving members of an easily identified group of individuals  free stuff, especially if this group can be reached and organized and weaponized by a political faction. Especially if this group is regarded by wider society as deserving. One example is cancer sufferers who were denied treatment with Herceptin by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NICE&lt;/span&gt;, which decided that its clinical benefits were marginal. 
This really is the ratchet of government action.
It&amp;#8217;s partially our instinctive dislike of loss being greater than our liking for gain. 
It&amp;#8217;s partially that simply nobody can visualize the losses suffered by the resources being diverted from more productive uses.
Milton Friedman wasn&amp;#8217;t quite right. Occasionally good is done by spending other people&amp;#8217;s money. 
Governments probably should tax and spend to build flood barriers.
But the vast bulk of government spending is quite different.
Ronald Coase thought deeply about this. 
See &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Problem_of_Social_Cost"&gt;The problem of social cost on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; for an introduction to to the&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is it so difficult for people to understand that when political action diverts resources from use A to use B not only does the reduced spending on B represent a cost, but that the redistribution of resources and the damage to incentives might reduce the total resources to spend on A and B in&amp;nbsp;aggregate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got thinking about all this when I read the replies to this tweet from Helen&amp;nbsp;Barnard:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got an idea for a book: Policies that Worked. What policies in the last 50 years have been a resounding&amp;nbsp;success?&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Helen Barnard (@Helen_Barnard) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Helen_Barnard/status/1365752573114912777?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People proposed all sorts of terrible policies as having been a resounding success, in the teeth of good statistical evidence to the contrary. 
Most people do not have any sort of feeling for statistical inference and use their gut instinct to decide on which policies are good. 
And their own net wealth.
Why should they do otherwise?
Any politician that uses statistics or economic reasoning to point out why their are wrong is simply commiting electoral &lt;em&gt;hara-kiri&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>There no bubble.

&lt;p&gt;The dream team of thought-leaders at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPM&lt;/span&gt; had a conference call arguing that there is no bubble in the equity markets or credit markets: &amp;#8220;We do not see a broad equity market bubble but rather certain pockets of the market that are experiencing hyper growth such as electric vehicles and renewables. While there is a lot of talk about bubbles, it is hard to see one in the broad equity market, where a dominant group (FANGs) practically hasn’t moved for 6 months despite massive amount of stimulus and an expected economic recovery, Financials that have barely recovered 2020 losses, and Energy that is still down 25% from last year despite a commodity bull&amp;nbsp;market&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this is totally ordinary behaviour for a broad stock&amp;nbsp;index?&lt;/p&gt;

I don&amp;#8217;t know how Saxo Bank have arrived at this. I am frankly sceptical that anyone actually can predict, with any meaningful accuracy, the free cash flow of Facebook in 20 years time: the assumptions needed to arrive at any hard numbers would have to be so heroic as to make Superman seem like Clark Kent. 
However, the fact remains that if one holds onto the idea that a share price today is equal to the present value of cashflow returns to the holder in the future (an assumption that more or less underpins all corporate finance theory), you have to assume some insanely low discount rates going out a very long time indeed.
The world has experienced four decades of declining nominal rates. Maybe this trend will continue for another twenty years. Maybe, even, it will continue for another thirty. But surely the probability of Japanification of the West coming to an end must be significantly more than zero, which would be a big problem for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex Manzara captures the mood of yesterday&amp;nbsp;neatly: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/potato-heads/"&gt;In Oct 2018, Powell said we’re nowhere close to neutral.  Stocks tanked.  By Christmas, the Fed’s tone changed, and easing followed.  The recent mantra is that “we’re nowhere close to full employment”.  How does the Fed walk back the vow of endless accommodation, now that the market is anticipating inflation and higher long-end rates?  Tighten to flatten the&amp;nbsp;curve?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Hipgnosis&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sells Sanctuary? 
 The music business/press love-in with Hipgnosis reached new heights this week, with a Billboard cover lauding founder Merck Mercuriadis as &amp;#8220;the man who bought the&amp;nbsp;world&amp;#8221;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll maybe know Hipgnosis as the fund that makes headlines every couple of weeks whenever it buys up some massive share of a famous music artist&amp;#8217;s back catalogue. So far it&amp;#8217;s raised around $1bn and bought the rights to thousands of songs, under the theory that these are all assets that will appreciate in value.  &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;One thing largely overlooked in all the self-publicity though is how similar the early trajectory of Hipgnosis is to Merck&amp;#8217;s previous employers, Sanctuary Records. Sanctuary was huge for a while. The business model was to buy loads of management companies in eyebrow-raising, publicity-generating megabucks deals. This increased their valuation and share price, making big bucks for the bosses. Or at least it did until it became obvious that the deals actually created little in the way of value. Then the share price tanked, regulators found a load of accounting irregularities and it was left to be rescued by&amp;nbsp;Universal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hipgnosis is currently paying huge money for a load of songs. The share price is going up and Merck makes his advisory fees based on the valuation of the company. So let&amp;#8217;s hope the business model is a bit more robust this time&amp;nbsp;around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#&amp;nbsp;Wrap&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairly&amp;nbsp;risk-off/deflationary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; +1%, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DJI&lt;/span&gt; -1%, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; 0% –&amp;nbsp;deflationary,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; 10Y yield &lt;em&gt;down&lt;/em&gt; to 1.44%, but nearly all other markets, yields&amp;nbsp;up,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most global equities markets down, especially &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All commodities down: gold by 2.3%. Oil &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; copper down by&amp;nbsp;~3%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal Consumption Expenditure in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; jumped 2.4% month-on-month, which you&amp;#8217;d expect to be inflationary, but it&amp;#8217;s increasingly looking as though Biden will continue a lot of Trump&amp;nbsp;policies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bombing the Middle&amp;nbsp;East,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cancelling the Federal minimum&amp;nbsp;wage,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cancelling the stimulus cheques (at least the&amp;nbsp;$1.4K),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;? cancelling infrastructure&amp;nbsp;spending.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks as though the conclusion is that real interest rates are increasing, which is boosting bonds and crushing gold.

This will test Prof Plum&amp;#8217;s thesis that once passive funds start to get redemptions, there will be a vicious spiral of price declines, as there are no active managers left to buy when passive is&amp;nbsp;selling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Street has noticed this, and one guy has even gone as far as to track &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s holdings.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/when-does-stimulus-become-negative-for-stocks/"&gt;Alex Manzara thinks so&lt;/a&gt;. A lot of the people I follow do. However, I am experienced enough to realize that just because a lot of people predict something, this doesn&amp;#8217;t make it more likely to happen. In fact – especially if they are the more thoughtful commentators – it seems less likely. 
Maybe we&amp;#8217;ll see even higher highs as the vaccine is rolled out. But the demographic trends are negative, the scarring is real, and a lot of people have died and those who haven&amp;#8217;t will not want to rush out to spend. In fact, they have acquired the savings habit during the lockdown and may well decide that it&amp;#8217;s one they will keep up. If this drains demand, we&amp;#8217;ll see poor growth (&amp;#8216;the paradox of thrift&amp;#8217;) and people will want to save more. Banks have had a happy time lending on credit cards at 30% and borrowing from central banks at zero or negative rates. We may even see a flattening of the curve, and further Japanification. Certainly, negative rates and yield curve control may come in. The fact that most central bankers have vehemently denied that these tools will ever be used is all the more reason for fearing that they will&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;An &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EV&lt;/span&gt; company with profits, and&amp;nbsp;prospects?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m deeply sceptical of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EV&lt;/span&gt; companies in general. Bluebird ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BLBD&lt;/span&gt;) might be an exception. &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4407937-blue-bird-is-undervalued-electric-vehicle-manufacturer"&gt;You&amp;nbsp;decide.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tether paid a fine (along with Bitfinex) for fraud. It&amp;#8217;s still a very valuable cryptocurrency. &amp;#8220;Cryptofraud&amp;#8221; might be a better term.&amp;nbsp;https://www.ft.com/content/1d3b5027-ce7e-470f-8d7a-866746f8079d&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, volatility is just duration. Credit complicates this. Preferreds are really equity. I need to think about&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="e4b6f27786e88981c01c506c970a7906.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/e4b6f27786e88981c01c506c970a7906.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Warren Buffett observed, a long time ago, once inflation ticks up to a more than a slight nuisance, the cost escalation imposed on capex overwhelms the price pickup on&amp;nbsp;sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="1611a1c9703bdec318c0e8397aa9183d.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/1611a1c9703bdec318c0e8397aa9183d.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;while inflation has been very low, there is a positive correlation between it &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; price. This can break down, as per the&amp;nbsp;above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Stimulus&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lacey Hunt is a legend. &lt;a href="https://www.macrovoices.com/podcast-transcripts/551-dr-lacy-hunt-u-s-economy-will-continue-to-decline-for-the-balance-of-2019"&gt;His interview on Macro Voices&lt;/a&gt; is a classic exposition of what he stands for, which&amp;nbsp;is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;too much debt destroys&amp;nbsp;growth,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the fiscal multiplier declines to less than one as debt goes beyond ~80% of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Japan shows that you cannot borrow your way out of a&amp;nbsp;recession, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inflation will not happen as a result of unconventional monetary&amp;nbsp;policy,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deflation is a much bigger risk than&amp;nbsp;inflation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a huge amount of talk about stimulus recently. &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6254971a-96dd-41a9-a037-acf3ffa6275b"&gt;El Erian has written about it in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
His argument is that the Fed cannot reduce monetary loosening, because this will create too much market instability, but it will create lots of political problems because it will continue to exacerbate inequality.
Powell is professionally obliged to deny all this, because to acknowledge the risks is to increase the chance of them being realized.
I imagine he cannot wait until he is safely out of the hot seat giving Zoom talks to Citadel for $850,000 a throw and the next Fed chair is in the hot seat.
(Which is bound to be a woman, presumably Lael&amp;nbsp;Brainard.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Michael Burry, who is as much of a hero to the autists from Wall Street Bets as Elon is, has written that inflation is coming.
You can read more about it &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr8h1v/why_father_burry_is_calling_the_big_short_20_i/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was a short-duration risk-on&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most equity markets higher, but Far East markets down, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; up 1.2%, more than &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt;, up&amp;nbsp;0.8%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt;)really stuck in a down&amp;nbsp;trend,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; down to just over 90. If it breaks 90, I think it&amp;#8217;ll go down further; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZAR&lt;/span&gt; down, as the govt. lurches from crisis to&amp;nbsp;crisis,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10-year yields up across the board, apart from a few Far East countries (which might have closed 15 hours&amp;nbsp;ago).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newsflow was not dramatic. Even though Powell&amp;#8217;s testimony yesterday said nothing new, it&amp;#8217;s still making headlines. 
There is simply no new important&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Opinion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing I have learned from watching markets for a very long time, is that they can not only remain irrational longer than one can remain solvent, but that they can become irrational without any rhyme or reason.
We have seen an explosion of value in bitcoin. Nothing about the real economy, the behaviour of central banks or the nature of bitcoin can explain this behaviour. 
It is purely the result of herd mentality, or – if you prefer – reflexivity, as defined by George Soros.
A lot of people read and dismissed &lt;em&gt;The Alchemy of Finance&lt;/em&gt; because it seemed to simply say that in securities markets, broadly defined, people would start to buy because they saw the price moving. In other words &amp;#8220;if you see a bubble forming, hop on it!&amp;#8221; 
Commentators simply thought that this was an interesting observation, but had no practical application. 
I think it can have a practical application, but it probably doesn&amp;#8217;t fit Warren Buffett&amp;#8217;s definition of&amp;nbsp;investing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the $64T question is: &lt;em&gt;Which assets are in a reflexive bubble, and when will these bubbles burst?&lt;/em&gt; 
Nobody knows, even though many pretend that they do. 
Nobody wants to listen to a person explaining why he doesn&amp;#8217;t know, which is why not many of you are reading&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>You are more likely to be killed by your own furniture than you are to be killed by a terrorist</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/you-are-more-likely-to-be-killed-by-your-own-furniture-than-you-are-to-be-killed-by-a-terrorist.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-02-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:50+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-02-23:/you-are-more-likely-to-be-killed-by-your-own-furniture-than-you-are-to-be-killed-by-a-terrorist.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;

We tend to focus more on negative things, for obvious reasons (things that are going well don&amp;#8217;t need our attention). All the information we receive is filtered through our existing knowledge, with each sentence examined for consistency with our existing outlook. It&amp;#8217;s immensely difficult to really embrace ideas that conflict with our beliefs, which is why it takes so long to move the famous Overton&amp;nbsp;Window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="1cfbd285814481ec342909c19e42f370.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/1cfbd285814481ec342909c19e42f370.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Weaker credit spread&amp;nbsp;collapsing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="embed-container"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=Bjjr&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shows that weaker credits are paying less for their debt than previously (relative to their high score competitors).
The conclusion of this is that inflation is going to take off, which, in moderation will result in improving margins. 
I don&amp;#8217;t know what the typical Baa borrower is: a pretty strong company, I&amp;#8217;d guess.
The breakeven inflation rate (derived from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TIPS&lt;/span&gt; prices)is showing a sustained&amp;nbsp;rise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked up this stuff from today&amp;#8217;s Daily&amp;nbsp;Shot,  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Cables for capital&amp;nbsp;appreciation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3f7925c0-4e62-473b-a330-f117393c96fc"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; today is about Prysmian, Nexans and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NKT&lt;/span&gt;. All firms involved in laying underseas power cables, which will increasingly be needed if offshore wind is going to have a meaningful impact on supplying global electricity&amp;nbsp;demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty risk off today. The frothier shares falling quite&amp;nbsp;sharply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSTR&lt;/span&gt; (MicroStrategy) down 20%. As volatile as a crypto&amp;nbsp;currency!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;REAL&lt;/span&gt; (the RealReal) down&amp;nbsp;14%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TRCH&lt;/span&gt; (Torchlight Energy) down&amp;nbsp;17%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CELH&lt;/span&gt; (Celsius Holdings) down&amp;nbsp;10.3%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; (Tesla) down&amp;nbsp;6.2%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been a while since anything ever declined in price. These stocks might bounce, but it&amp;#8217;s less and less likely, I think. The wider market (at 5:50pm &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;) was down modestly: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; 1%, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; 2.3%, Russell 2000 2.4%.  The market has rise so high, it had to give back some eventually.
The Treasury has started spending the cash from the Treasury General Account. This is in some sense draining liquidity from the&amp;nbsp;system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Update: close of business, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A last minute ramp from Jay Powell in his semi-annual monetary policy report to Congress reversed the losses so that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; ended up 0.1%. 
Bonds close to flat.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; up&amp;nbsp;0.13%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities continued their upward march, with crude up to&amp;nbsp;$61.86.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a residual interest in silver and copper. 
Real assets are clearly a safer bet than nominal ones, and short duration assets are safer than long duration ones.
All we need now is for the market to wake up to these obvious&amp;nbsp;facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Lyn&amp;nbsp;Alden:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyn has produced &lt;a href="https://www.lynalden.com/february-2021-newsletter/"&gt;her Feb newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s mainly about inflation, money supply, the interdependence of the Fed and Treasury to actually create &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; money. It&amp;#8217;s long, but there are only twelve a year, and so it&amp;#8217;s not that much to read.
She has a great quote from&amp;nbsp;Druck:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would say my overriding theme is inflation relative to what the policymakers think. But, because of the policymaker response, which could be very varied based on the vaccine and how they respond to various metrics, I found it’s better to have a&amp;nbsp;matrix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, basically the play is inflation. I have a short Treasury position, primarily at the long end. Because the Fed could drive me crazy, and not let that come to fruition, I also have a large position in commodities. The longer the Fed tries to keep rates suppressed, so they’ll have stimulus in the pipeline, the more I win on my commodities. The quicker the Fed responds, the quicker I might have a problem with my&amp;nbsp;commodities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then because of the juxtapostion of our [&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;] policy response vs Asia, I also have a very, very short dollar&amp;nbsp;position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A Boeing 777 had an engine disintegrate mid-flight. Probably bullish for the&amp;nbsp;stock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[ ] - the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MOVE&lt;/span&gt; index (bond vol) is suggesting that equity vol is about to pick&amp;nbsp;up:&lt;/li&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s wilting now.
It could be the shape of things to come.
In a recession, credit weakens before govt. debt, because bond portfolio managers increase their weighting of safe&amp;nbsp;assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market is behaving spookily predictably, as if it has just woken up to the implications of Yellen&amp;#8217;s fiscal stimulus combined with Powell&amp;#8217;s monetization of debt. 
This makes no sense, as this has been a wholly predictable development since the beginning of&amp;nbsp;November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Bonds across the piste have modestly higher yields; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; 10Y now at&amp;nbsp;1.37%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is, will this all reverse violently tomorrow, or will it&amp;nbsp;continue?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norilsk Nickel (a bit platinum producer) down nearly 8%. No idea&amp;nbsp;why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all need somewhere to live.
Homes are both a necessity, and a luxury good. 
A house is like a loaf of bread, we must have somewhere to rest our weary head, even if it&amp;#8217;s a tent under a flyover.
Like art or opera tickets, a house is something we spend more of our income on (in percentage terms) as our income goes up.
This makes residential real estate both a defensive and a growth asset.
It is also very interest rate sensitive.
It is very sensitive to the the overall state of the economy.
Finally, it is a value sector, and therefore has underperformed the rest of the market over the last ten&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4407594-when-wall-street-likes-apartments"&gt;this article from Seeking Alpha&lt;/a&gt; points out, Wall Street analysts change their price forecasts when the market has shown them why their previous forecasts were&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chart from the same article shows a few REITs which are traded in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;.
The time may still not be ripe to investigate this sector, but it&amp;#8217;s worth reading up on it.
As the article points out, just buying or selling on naive metrics like price/book or dividend yield is probably going to be a bad choice.
As in all cases, a deeper dive is&amp;nbsp;needed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Junk is now Shabby&amp;nbsp;Chic&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk about getting in on the ground floor.  The recent upward jolt in interest rates has had little ill effect on the booming high-yield market, as the average yield on double-B-rated companies reached a record low 2.98% earlier this week, dropping below the dividend yield on the S&amp;amp;P Utilities Index for the first time. On the other end of the credit spectrum, yields on the triple-C-rated component of the Bloomberg Barclays Index also reached a record low 6.1% earlier this&amp;nbsp;week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evaporating yields have flipped traditional dynamics upside down.  Bloomberg reported on Feb. 5 that income-hungry investors have resorted to “calling up companies and pressing them to borrow, instead of waiting for bankers to bring new deals to&amp;nbsp;them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.grantspub.com/"&gt;Grant&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; is pointing out that we are still in the Euphoria stage of a bubble, according to Minsky&amp;#8217;s taxonomy (we&amp;#8217;ve been through Displacement and Boom, we still have Profit Taking and Panic to look forward to). It&amp;#8217;s still too dangerous to call this market: this music is still playing, we&amp;#8217;ve got to get up and dance, but ideally not too far from the emergency exit&amp;nbsp;door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Equities need more &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

I don&amp;#8217;t need convincing, but this might persuade you.
The thesis is that energy and copper are poised to rip, and precious metals too.
Anyone who is watching gold will know that it has simply not gone anywhere lately, so the thesis is damaged.
A basket of commodities, though, has done well (especially oil) since last April. It is quite plausible that it has further to go.

&lt;p&gt;Basically, inflationary. Every govt. bond market except China has increasing yields. (Norway was flat.)
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; is weak: down to 90.355. 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; is going down, even against the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPY&lt;/span&gt;. I am still inclined to think that the time has come for Japan &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; co. to reflate, but maybe not yet.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; equities down, European up. Commodity markets (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MOEX&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSX&lt;/span&gt;) up quite a bit.
Commodities mixed. Copper still strong, energy down, precious metals up, ag. commodities&amp;nbsp;mixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Reflections: the problem of &amp;#8220;free&amp;nbsp;money&amp;#8221;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milton Friedman said, in&amp;nbsp;2004:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four ways in which you can spend money.  You can spend your own money on yourself.  When you do that, why then you really watch out what you’re doing, and you try to get the most for your money.  Then you can spend your own money on somebody else.  For example, I buy a birthday present for someone.  Well, then I’m not so careful about the content of the present, but I’m very careful about the cost.  Then, I can spend somebody else’s money on myself.  And if I spend somebody else’s money on myself, then I’m sure going to have a good lunch!  Finally, I can spend somebody else’s money on somebody else.  And if I spend somebody else’s money on somebody else, I’m not concerned about how much it is, and I’m not concerned about what I get.  And that’s government.  And that’s close to 40% of our national&amp;nbsp;income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; now, government is spending around 60% of our national income.  I&amp;#8217;ve read that this is a higher proportion of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; than was ever managed in the old Soviet economy, but I don&amp;#8217;t have the reference, but it&amp;#8217;s certainly a lot of&amp;nbsp;government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milton wasn&amp;#8217;t quite right, in the sense that if I am a politician spending somebody else&amp;#8217;s money on somebody else, I am concerned about how much I spend, and how much I get because eventually the voters will notice that a lot of money is taken out of their wallets as tax and they don&amp;#8217;t get much back in the form of public services. Of course, this only matters when governments are elected by a democratic&amp;nbsp;process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even this is a simplification, because in a modern democracy one tier of government through which all democratic choices are exercised is not a practical proposition. In the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; now we have (ignoring devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales) the possibility of democratic elections at national, county, district and parish tiers. If each tier raised exactly what it spent from its own voters, this would not be so much of a problem. But this can&amp;#8217;t happen, because then we&amp;#8217;d have a &amp;#8216;postcode lottery&amp;#8217; in which some citizens received better public services than others. The fact that they may have less money, or be less willing to spend similar sums is ignored. This results in transfers from some areas to others: something which is impossible to avoid in a&amp;nbsp;democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The side effect of this is that the link between local spending and local taxation is severed, and with it the natural brake on the frugality of local councils. This explains why councils are rewarded for bad decisions by receiving subsidies from voters in better run areas of the country, and entrenched&amp;nbsp;administrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, it&amp;#8217;s a lot easier to state the problem than to solve it, especially when the  electoral effects of taking away &amp;#8220;free stuff&amp;#8221; can be devastatingly damaging. 
So we muddle on, hoping that something will turn up.
Poor old Milton must be spinning in his&amp;nbsp;grave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union Labour Force Participation is still under 58%. 
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; had levels which were in the 90&amp;#8217;s, for men.
How can there be any doubt that no amount of fiscal stimulus will  raise inflation with such low levels of&amp;nbsp;participatio?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A good way to play energy is options on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SXEP&lt;/span&gt;, according to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s Kolanovic (h/t The Market Ear). There is a lot of talk about oil/commodities supercycles. Certainly, commodities have been fairly strong recently, and it&amp;#8217;s not difficult to explain: a long period of under-performance, frantic money printing and fiscal stimulus. The problem is to explain why these factors are not already in the&amp;nbsp;price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rush Limbaugh, the original shock jock, has died. Where he lead, in offering highly polarized content, many others have followed. The world is not a better place, although I have a certain sympathy for&amp;nbsp;him. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Bear Cave fingered $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TRIT&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROOT&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CELH&lt;/span&gt;: Triterras (blockchain-enabled trade finance), Root Insurance  (insurance), Celsius Holdings (energy drinks). These have been on my radar for a while, but in a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WSB&lt;/span&gt; reddit world, shorting may lead to&amp;nbsp;electrocution. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d4ba70ea-c8f6-4bb7-aeef-30b97c669366"&gt;David Waddill writes in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to argue that the big Asian countries have been artificially holding down their currencies by buying lots of Treasuries, suppressing domestic demand with high interest rates, and generally saving too much. He argues that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury should act to force them to do their bit to reflate the world economy. He mentions Japan and China as big offenders. It&amp;#8217;s about time we saw &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JGB&lt;/span&gt; rates&amp;nbsp;rise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;article in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; saying that the new boss of Total ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FP&lt;/span&gt;) had said that his rivals (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BP&lt;/span&gt;, but not named) were paying way over the odds for green investments for greenwash purposes. This is probably true, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t mean that there will be a bull market in Green Ponzi for a long time&amp;nbsp;yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4406983-torchlight-0_35-value-at-25-percent-merged-company"&gt;Torchlight Energy Resources a sell&lt;/a&gt; according to White Diamond Research. It&amp;#8217;s a reverse merger play to get a&amp;nbsp;listing. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://wallstreetonparade.com/2021/02/gamestop-hearing-citadels-ken-griffin-doesnt-let-the-brutal-facts-get-in-the-way-of-his-testimony/"&gt;Inflation is coming, according to Bridgden&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;He expects that after enduring some pain in the markets, the Fed will throw in the towel on the idea of Fed independence and keep monetary policy accommodative in the face of rapidly rising inflation to avoid social unrest.&lt;/em&gt; according to Taps Coogan&amp;#8217;s summary. A purging dose of inflation is clearly the only way to pay for the levels of deficit spending that western democracies are now engaged in. It&amp;#8217;s remarkable that so many people are in denial about this. It was how the Second World War was paid for, and it is how the war against &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SARS&lt;/span&gt;-Cov2 will be paid&amp;nbsp;for. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://wallstreetonparade.com/2021/02/gamestop-hearing-citadels-ken-griffin-doesnt-let-the-brutal-facts-get-in-the-way-of-his-testimony/"&gt;Ken Griffin&amp;#8217;s alternative&amp;nbsp;reality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally risk off. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; initial jobless claims were 861e3 vs 773e3 expected.
This pushed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; yields down very slightly. 
Yields elsewhere were up, but not by much. Germany 10 year paper was trading at -0.37%: an insanely low number, but higher than it was yesterday.
Commodities were generally hammered: oil was down 1.8%, nat. gas 5.6%. 
Expectations seem to be that curves will continue to&amp;nbsp;steepen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OAS&lt;/span&gt; is a measure of the market measure of economic risk. Note how this exploded in 2008. 
It&amp;#8217;s imperfect but is very up to day, and it clearly shows how the market was still considering that the risk of the economy coming off the rails as being minimal. 
Until this turns, stonks will go up &amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp;probably!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Reflections&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-italy-politics-draghi-idUKKBN2AH1C6"&gt;Super Mario is going to rescue the Italian economy&lt;/a&gt;.  He&amp;#8217;s going to do this by rebalancing the economy geographically, and sectorally, he&amp;#8217;s going to create all the Green jobs that will be created by having a wind turbine on every street corner, he&amp;#8217;s going to fix the problems with the education system so that all school leavers will be good enough at coding to get a job with Google, he&amp;#8217;s going to cut waste and eliminate tax avoidance, and fix the demographic cliff and generally make Italy productive and&amp;nbsp;prosperous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, of course, he&amp;#8217;s not. Because all incoming governments say they&amp;#8217;ll do some variation of these things, in every country, and in every case they discover that it&amp;#8217;s a lot harder to do these things than they thought. 
But, how could they have known?

&lt;li&gt;most global equity indexes down, apart from the antiquated Dow Jones Industrial Average, which squeezed out another 0.34% to reach yet another all-time&amp;nbsp;high,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fairly quiet on the foreign exchange desks, except the Brazilian Real (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BRL&lt;/span&gt;) was down 0.74% and the Swiss Franc something&amp;nbsp;similar!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yields up everywhere, even Germany. This is risk on, but the moves are not&amp;nbsp;large,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;energy commodities generally up, precious metals down, except platinum, probably, which has been going parabolic&amp;nbsp;lately,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; gang mostly up. Apple down&amp;nbsp;1.85%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, a slow news day. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOMC&lt;/span&gt; meeting a damp squib (no change in policy foreseen), industrial output, and prices, both rising strongly. Producer prices went up 1.3% in January: if this keeps going, the Fed will end up tightening before the year is&amp;nbsp;out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Comment&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prince Philip, the DoE, was admitted to hospital. 
The institution of the monarchy in Britain is a bizarre overhang of something that once was politically important.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; establishment, especially the upper classes, has a great talent for absorbing all sorts in order to profit from them.
This was rather elegantly explained in &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2021/02/13/the-british-establishment-is-the-worlds-most-open-for-a-price"&gt;Bagehot&amp;#8217;s recent column in the Economist Magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>When Does a Stock Act Right?</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/when-does-a-stock-act-right.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-02-16:/when-does-a-stock-act-right.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WHEN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOES&lt;/span&gt; A &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STOCK&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIGHT&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Markets never stand still. They are very dull at …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WHEN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOES&lt;/span&gt; A &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STOCK&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RIGHT&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks, like individuals, have character and personality. Some are high-strung, nervous, and jumpy: others are forthright, direct, logical. One comes to know and respect individual securities. Their action is predictable under varying sets of&amp;nbsp;conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets never stand still. They are very dull at times, but they are not resting at one price. They are either moving up or down a fraction. When a stock gets into a definite trend, it works automatically and consistently along certain lines throughout the progress of its&amp;nbsp;move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the move you will notice a very large volume of sales with gradually advancing prices for a few days. Then what I term a ‘Normal Reaction&amp;#8221; will occur. On that reaction the sales volume will be much less than on the previous days of its advance. Now that little reaction is only normal. Never be afraid of the normal movement. But be very fearful of abnormal&amp;nbsp;movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a day or two activity will start again, and the volume will increase. If it is a real movement, in a short space of time the natural, normal reaction will have been recovered, and the stock will be selling in new high territory. That movement should continue strong for a few days with only minor daily  reactions. Sooner or later it will reach a point where it is due for another normal reaction. When it occurs, it should be on the same lines as the first reaction, because that is the natural way any stock will act when it is in a definite trend. At the first part of a movement of this kind the distance above the previous high point to the next high point is not very great. But as time goes on you will notice that it is making much faster headway on the&amp;nbsp;upside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me illustrate: Take a stock that starts at 50. On the first leg of the movement it might gradual sell up to 54. A day or two of normal reaction might carry it back to 52.5 or so. Three days later it is on its way again. In that time it might go up to 59 or 60 before the normal reaction would occur. But instead of reacting, say, only a point or a point and one-half, a natural reaction from that level could easily be 3 points. When it resumes its advance again in a few days, you will notice that the volume of sales at that time is not nearly as large as it was at the beginning of the move. The stock is becoming harder to buy. That being the case, the next points in the movement will be much more rapid than before. The stock could easily go from the previous high of 60 to 68 or 70 without encountering a natural reaction. When that normal reaction does occur, it could be more severe. It could easily react down to 65 and still have only a normal decline. But assuming that the reaction was five points or thereabouts, it should not be many days before the advance would be resumed, and the stock should be selling at a brand new high price. And that is where the time element comes&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t let the stock go stale on you. After attaining a goodly profit, you must have patience but don&amp;#8217;t let patience create a frame of mind that ignores the danger&amp;nbsp;signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock starts up again, and it has a rise of six or seven points in one day, followed the next day by perhaps eight to ten points&amp;#8212;with great activity—but during the last hour of the day all of a sudden it has an abnormal break of seven or eight points. The next morning it extends its reaction another point or so, and then once more starts to advance, closing very strong. But the following day, for some reason, it does not carry&amp;nbsp;through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an immediate danger signal. All during the progress of the move it had nothing but natural and normal reactions. Then all of a sudden an abnormal reaction occurs — and by &amp;#8220;abnormal&amp;#8221; I mean a reaction in one day of six or more points from an extreme price made in that same day — something it has not had before, and when something happens abnormally stock-marketwise it is flashing you a danger signal which must not he&amp;nbsp;ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have had patience to stay with the stock all during its natural progress. Now have the courage and good sense to honor the danger signal and step&amp;nbsp;aside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not say that the- danger signals are always correct because, as I stated before, no rules applying to stock fluctuations are l00% right. But if you pay attention to them consistently in the long run you will profit&amp;nbsp;immensely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A speculator of great genius once told me:
&amp;#8220;When I see a danger signal handed to me, I don&amp;#8217;t argue with it. I get out! A few days later, if everything looks all right, I can always go back in again. Thereby I have saved myself a lot of worry and money. I figure it out this way. If I were walking along a railroad track and saw an express train coming at me sixty miles an hour, I would not be damned fool enough not to get off the track and let the train go by. After it had passed, I could always get back on the track again, if I desired.&amp;#8221; I have always remembered that as a graphic bit of speculative&amp;nbsp;wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every judicious speculator is on the alert for danger signals. Curiously, the trouble with most speculators is that something inside of them keeps them from mustering enough courage to close out their commitment when they should. They hesitate and during that period of hesitation they watch the market go many points against them. Then they say: &amp;#8220;On the next rally I&amp;#8217;ll get out!&amp;#8221; When the next rally comes, as it will eventually, they forget what they intended to do, because in their opinion the market is acting fine again. However, that rally was only a temporary swing which soon plays out, and then the market starts to go down in earnest. And they are in it—due to their hesitation. If they had been using a guide, it would have told them what to do, not only saving them a lot of money but eliminating their&amp;nbsp;worries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again let me say, the human side of every person is the greatest enemy of the average investor or speculator. Why shouldn&amp;#8217;t a stock rally after it starts down from a big advance? Of course it will rally from some level. But why hope it is going to rally at just the time you want it to rally? Chances are it won&amp;#8217;t, and if it does, the vacillating type of speculator will not take advantage of&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am trying to make clear to that part of the public which desires to regard speculation as a serious business, and I wish deliberately to reiterate it, is that wishful thinking must be banished; that one cannot be successful by speculating every day or every week; that there are only a few times a year, possibly four or five, when you should allow yourself to make any commitment at all. In the interims you are letting the market shape itself for the next big&amp;nbsp;movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have timed the movement correctly, your first commitment will show a profit at the start. From then on, all that is required of you is to be alert, watching for the appearance of the danger signal to tell you to step aside and convert paper profits into real&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember this: When you are doing nothing, those speculators who feel they must trade day in and day out, are laying the foundation for your next venture. You will reap benefits from their&amp;nbsp;mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculation is far too exciting. Most people who speculate hound the brokerage offices or receive frequent telephone calls, and after the business day they talk markets with friends at all gatherings. The ticker or translux is always on their minds. They are so engrossed with the minor ups and downs that they miss the big movements. Almost invariably the vast majority have commitments on the wrong side when the broad trend swings under way. The speculator who insists on trying to profit from daily minor movements will never be in a position to take advantage of the next important change marketwise when it occurs.
Such weaknesses can be corrected by keeping and studying records of stock price movements and how they occur, and by taking the time element carefully into&amp;nbsp;account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many years ago I heard of a remarkably successful speculator who lived in the California mountains and received quotations three days old. Two or three times a year he would call on his San Francisco broker and begin writing out orders to buy or sell, depending upon his market position. A friend of mine, who spent time in the broker&amp;#8217;s office, became curious and made inquiries. His astonishment mounted when he learned of the man&amp;#8217;s extreme detachment from market facilities, his rare visits, and, on occasions, his tremendous volume of trade. Finally he was introduced, and the course of conversation inquired of this man from the mountains how he could keep track of the stock market at such an isolated&amp;nbsp;distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Well,&amp;#8221; he replied, &amp;#8220;I make speculation a business. I would be a failure if I were in the confusion of things and let myself be distracted by minor changes. I like to be away where I can think. You see, I keep a record of what has happened, after it has happened, and it gives me a rather clear picture of what markets are doing. Real movements do not end the day they start. It takes time to complete the end of a genuine movement. By being up in the mountains I am in a position to give these movements all the time they need. But a day comes when I get some prices out of the paper and put them down in my records. I notice the prices I recorded are not conforming to the same pattern of movements that has been apparent for some time. Right then I make up my mind. I go to town and get&amp;nbsp;busy.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That happened many years ago. Consistently, the man from the mountains, over a long period of time, drew funds abundant1y from the stock market. He was something of an inspiration to me. I went to work harder than ever trying to blend the time element with all the other data I had compiled. By constant effort I was able to bring my records into a co-ordination that aided me to a surprising degree in anticipating coming&amp;nbsp;movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game of speculation is the most uniformly fascinating game in the world. But it is not a game for the stupid, the mentally lazy, the man of inferior emotional balance, nor for the get-rich-quick adventurer. They will die&amp;nbsp;poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a long period of years …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHALLENGE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPECULATION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game of speculation is the most uniformly fascinating game in the world. But it is not a game for the stupid, the mentally lazy, the man of inferior emotional balance, nor for the get-rich-quick adventurer. They will die&amp;nbsp;poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a long period of years I have rarely attended a dinner party including strangers that someone did not sit down beside me and after the usual pleasantries inquire:
&amp;#8220;How can I make some money in the market?&amp;#8221; In my younger days I would go to considerable pains to explain all the difficulties faced by the one who simply wishes to take quick and easy money out of the market; or through courteous evasiveness I would work my way out of the snare. In later years my answer has been a blunt I don&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;know.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to exercise patience with such people. In the first place, the inquiry is not a compliment to the man who has made a scientific study of investment and speculation. It would be as fair for the layman to ask an attorney or a surgeon:
&amp;#8220;How can I make some quick money in law or surgery?&amp;#8221;
I have come to the conviction, however, that larger numbers of people interested in stock-market investment and speculation would be willing to
work and study to attain sensible results, if they had a guide or signpost pointing the right direction. And it is for them that this book is&amp;nbsp;written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is my purpose to include some of the highlights of a lifetime of speculative experience—a record of some of the failures and successes and the lessons that each has taught. Out of it all emerges my theory of time element in trading, which I regard as the most important factor in successful speculation - but before we go further, let me warn you that the fruits of your success will be in direct ratio to the honesty and sincerity of your own effort in keeping your own records, doing your own thinking, and reaching your own&amp;nbsp;conclusions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot wisely read a book on &amp;#8220;How to Keep Fit&amp;#8221; and leave the physical exercises to another. Nor can you delegate to another the task of keeping your records, if you are to follow faithfully my formula for combining the time element and prices, as set forth in subsequent&amp;nbsp;pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only light the way, and I shall be happy, if through my guidance, you are able to take more money out of the stock market than you put&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book, I present to that portion of the public, which at times may be speculatively inclined, some points and ideas which have been garnered during my many years as an investor and speculator. Anyone who is inclined to speculate should look at speculation as a business and treat it as such and not regard it as a pure gamble as so many people are apt to do. If I am correct in the premise that, speculation is a business in itself, those engaging in that business should determine to learn and understand it to the best of their ability with informative data available. In the forty years which I have devoted to making speculation a successful business venture, I have discovered and still am.
discovering new rules to apply to that&amp;nbsp;business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On many occasions I have gone to bed wondering why I had not been able to foresee a certain imminent move, and awakened in the early hours of the ensuing morning with a new idea formulated. I was impatient for the morning to arrive in order to start checking over my records of past movements to determine whether the new idea had merit. In most cases it was far from being 100% right, but what good there wais in it was stored away in my subconscious mind. Perhaps, later, another idea would take form and I would immediately set to work checking it,&amp;nbsp;over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In time these various ideas began to crystallize and I was able to develop a concrete method of keeping records in such a form that I could use them as a&amp;nbsp;guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My theory and practical application have proved to my satisfaction that nothing new ever occurs in the business of speculating or investing in securities or commodities. There arc times when one should speculate, and just as surely there are times when one should not speculate. There is a very true adage: &amp;#8220;You can beat a horse race, but you can&amp;#8217;t beat the races.&amp;#8221; So it is with market operations. There are times when money can be made investing and speculating in stocks, but money cannot consistently be made trading every day or every week during the year. Only the foolhardy will try it. It just is not in the cards and cannot be&amp;nbsp;done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To invest or speculate successfully, one must form an opinion as to what the next move of importance will be in a given stock. Speculation is nothing more than anticipating coming movements. In order to anticipate correctly, one must have a definite basis for that anticipation. For instance, analyze in your own mind the effect, marketwise, that a certain piece of news which has been made public may have in relation to the market. Try to anticipate the psychological effect of this particular item on the mind of the public— particularly that portion of the public which primarily is interested. If you believe it likely to have a definite bullish or bearish effect marketwise, don&amp;#8217;t trust your own opinion and back your judgment until the action of the market itself confirms your opinion because the effect marketwise may not be as pronounced as you are inclined to believe it should&amp;nbsp;be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate: After the market has been in a definite trend for a given period, a bullish or bearish piece of news may not have the slightest effect on the market. The market itself at the time may be in an overbought or oversold condition, in which case the effect of that particular news would certainly be ignored. At such times the recording value of past performances under similar conditions becomes of inestimable value to the investor or speculator. At such times he must entirely ignore personal opinion and apply strict attention to the action of the market itself. Markets are never wrong—opinions often are. The latter are of no value to the investor or speculator unless the market acts in accordance with his ideas. No one man, or group of men, can make or break a market&amp;nbsp;today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One may form an opinion regarding a certain stock and believe that it is going to have a pronounced move, either up or down, and eventually be correct in his opinion but will lose money by presuming or acting on his opinion too soon. Believing it to be right, he acts immediately, only to find that after he has made his commitment, the stock goes the other way. The market becomes narrow, he becomes tired and goes out. Perhaps a few days later it begins to look all right, and in he goes again, but no sooner has he re-entered it than it turns against him once more. Once more he begins to doubt his opinion and sells out. Finally the move starts up. Having been too hasty and having made two erroneous commitments, he loses courage. It is also likely that he has made other commitments and is not in a position to assume more. Thus, by the time the real move in the stock he jumped into prematurely is on, he is out of&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point I would here emphasize is that after forming a definite opinion with respect to a certain stock or stocks—do not be too anxious to get into it. Wait and watch the action of that stock or stocks marketwise. Have a fundamental basis to be guided by. Say, for instance, a stock is selling around $25.00 and has been holding within a range of $22.00 to $28.00 for a considerable period. Assuming that you believe that the stock should eventually sell at $50.00 and it is $25.00 at the time, and in your opinion it will sell at $50.00 have patience and wait until the stock becomes active, until it makes a new high, say around $30.00. You will then know that marketwise you have been&amp;nbsp;justified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock must have gone into a very strong position, or it would not have reached $30.00. Having done so, it is altogether likely that it is on its way to a very definite advance— the move is on. That is the time for you to back your opinion. Don&amp;#8217;t let the fact that you did not buy at $25.00 cause you any aggravation. The chances are if you had, you would have become tired of waiting and would have been out of it when the move started, because having once gotten out at a lower price, you would have become disgruntled and would not have gone back in when you should&amp;nbsp;have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experience has proved to me that the real money made in speculating has been in commitments in a stock or commodity showing a profit right from the start. Later on, when some examples of my trading operations are given, you will notice I made my first trade at the psychological time—that is, at a time where the force of the movement was so strong that it simply had to carry through. Not on my operation but because the force was so strong behind that particular stock. It simply had to and did go. There have been many times when I, like many other speculators, have not had the patience to await the sure thing. I wanted to have an interest at all times. You may say: &amp;#8220;With all your experience, why did you allow yourself to do so?&amp;#8221; The answer to that is that I am human and subject to human&amp;nbsp;weakness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all speculators, I permitted impatience to out-maneuver good judgment. Speculation is very similar to playing a game of cards, whether it be poker, bridge or any similar game. Each of us is possessed with the common weakness of wanting to have an interest in every jackpot, and we certainly would like to play every hand at bridge. It is this human frailty which we all possess in some degree that becomes the investor&amp;#8217;s and speculator&amp;#8217;s greatest enemy and will eventually, if not safeguarded, bring about his downfall. It is a human trait to be hopeful and equally so to be fearful, but when you inject hope and fear into the business of speculation, you are faced with a very formidable hazard, because you are apt to get the two confused and in reverse&amp;nbsp;positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an illustration: You buy a stock at $30.00. The next day it has a quick run-up to $32.00 or $32.50. You immediately become fearful that if you don&amp;#8217;t take the profit, the next day you may see it fade away—so out you go with a small profit, when that is the very time you should entertain all the hope in the world. Why should you worry about losing two points&amp;#8221; profit which you did not have the previous day? If you can make two points profit in one day, you might make two or three the next, and perhaps five more the next week. As long as a stock is acting right, and the market is right, do not be in a hurry to take a profit. You know you are right, because if you were not, you would have no profit at all. Let it ride and ride along with it. It may grow into a very large profit, and as long as the action of the market does not give you any cause to worry, have the courage of your convictions and stay with&amp;nbsp;it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, suppose you buy a stock at $30.00 and the next day it goes to $28.00, showing a two-point toss. You would not be fearful that the next day would possibly see a three-point loss or more. No, you would regard it merely as a temporary reaction, feeling certain that the next day it would recover its loss. But that is the time that you should be worried. That two- point loss could be followed by two points the next day or possibly five or ten within the next week or two. That is when you should be fearful, because if you do not get out, you might be forced to take a much greater loss later on. That is the time you should protect yourself by selling your stock before the loss assumes larger&amp;nbsp;proportions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profits always take care of themselves but losses never do. The speculator has to insure himself against considerable tosses by taking the first small loss. In so doing, he keeps his account in order so that at some future time, when he has a constructive idea, he will be in a position to go into another deal, taking on the same amount of stock as he had when he was wrong. The speculator has to be his own insurance broker, and the only way he can continue in business is to guard his capital account and never permit himself to lose enough to jeopardize his operations at some future date when his market judgment is correct. While I believe that the successful investor or speculator must have well-advanced reasons for making commitments on either side of the market, I feel he must also be able through some form of a specific guide to determine when to make his first&amp;nbsp;commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me repeat, there are definitely certain times when a movement really gets underway, and I firmly believe that anyone who has the instinct of a speculator and has the patience, can devise a specific method to be used as a guide which will permit him to judge correctly when to make his initial commitment. Successful speculation is anything but a mere guess. To be consistently successful, an investor or speculator must have rules to guide him. Certain guides which I utilize may be of no value to anyone else. Why is that so? If they are of inestimable value to me, why should they not serve you equally well? The answer to that is— no guide can be l00% right. If I use a certain guide, my own pet one, I know what should be the result. If my stock does not act as I anticipated, I immediately determine the time is not yet ripe — so I close out my commitment. Perhaps a few days later my guide indicates I should get in again, so back I go, and probably this time it is l00% correct. I believe anyone who will take the time and trouble to study price movements should in time be able to develop a guide, which will aid him in future operations or investments. In this book I present some points which I have found valuable in my own speculative&amp;nbsp;operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great many traders keep charts or records of averages. They chase them around, up and down, and there is no question that these charts of averages do point out a definite trend at times. Personally, charts have never appealed to me. I think they are altogether too confusing. Nevertheless, I am just as much of a fanatic in keeping records as other people are in maintaining charts. They may be right, and I may be&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My preference for records is due to the fact that my recording method gives me a clear picture of what is happening. But it was not until I began to take into consideration the time element that my records really became useful in helping me to anticipate coming movements of importance. I believe that by keeping proper records and taking the time element into consideration—and I shall explain this in detail later—one can with a fair degree of accuracy forecast coming movements of importance. But it takes patience to do&amp;nbsp;so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Familiarize yourself with a stock, or different groups of stocks, and if you figure the time element correctly in conjunction with your records, sooner or later you will be able to determine when a major move is due. If you read your records correctly, you will pick the leading stock in any group. You must, I repeat, keep your own records. You must put down your own figures. Don&amp;#8217;t let anyone else do it for you. You will be surprised how many new ideas you will formulate in so doing, ideas which no one else could give to you, because they are your discovery, your secret, and you should keep them your&amp;nbsp;secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I offer in this book some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DONT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;S for investors and speculators. One of the primary rules is that one should never permit speculative ventures to run into investments. Investors often take tremendous losses for no other reason than that their stocks are bought and paid&amp;nbsp;for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How often have you heard an investor say: ‘I don&amp;#8217;t have to worry about fluctuations or margin calls. I never speculate. When I buy stocks, I buy them for an investment, and if they go down, eventually they will come&amp;nbsp;back.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But unhappily for such investors many stocks bought at a time when they were deemed good investments have later met with drastically changed conditions. Hence such so-called &amp;#8220;investment stocks&amp;#8221; frequently become purely speculative. Some go out of existence altogether. The original &amp;#8220;investment&amp;#8221; evaporates into thin air along with the capital of the investor. This occurrence is due to the failure to realize that so-called &amp;#8220;investments&amp;#8221; may be called upon in the future to face a new set of conditions which would jeopardize the earning capacity of the stock, originally bought for a permanent investment. Before the investor learns of this changed situation, the value of his investment is already greatly&amp;nbsp;depreciated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore the investor must guard his capital account just as the successful speculator does in his speculative ventures. If this were done, those who like to call themselves &amp;#8220;investors&amp;#8221; would not be forced to become unwilling speculators of the future—nor would trust fund accounts depreciate so much in their&amp;nbsp;value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will recall not so many years ago it was considered safer to have your money invested in the New York, New Haven &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Hartford Railroad than to have it in a bank. On April 28, 1902, New Haven was selling at $255 a share. In December of 1906, Chicago, Milwaukee &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; St. Paul sold at $199.62. In January of that same year Chicago Northwestern sold at $240 a share. On February 9 of that year Great Northern Railway sold at $348 a share. All were paying good&amp;nbsp;dividends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at those &amp;#8220;investments today: On January 2, 1940, they were quoted at the following prices:
New York, New Haven &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Hartford Railroad $0.50 per share; Chicago Northwestern at which is about $0.31 per share; Great Northern Railway at $26.62 per share. On January 2, 1940, there was no quotation for Chicago, Milwaukee &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; St. Paul but on January 5, 1940, it was quoted at $0.25 per&amp;nbsp;share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be simple to run down the list of hundreds of stocks which, in my time, have been considered gilt-edge investments, and which today are worth little or nothing. Thus, great investments tumble, and with them the fortunes of so-called conservative investors in the continuous distribution of&amp;nbsp;wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculators in stock markets have lost money. But I believe it is a safe statement that the money lost by speculation alone is small compared with the gigantic sums lost by so-called investors who have let their investments&amp;nbsp;ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my viewpoint, the investors are the big gamblers. They make a bet, stay with it, and if it goes wrong, they lose it all. The speculator might buy at the same time. But if he is an intelligent speculator, he will recognize—if he keeps records— the danger signal warning him all is not well. He will, by acting promptly, hold his losses to a minimum and await a more favorable opportunity to reenter the&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a stock starts sliding downward, no one can tell how far it will go. Nor can anyone guess the ultimate top on a stock in a broad upward movement. A few thoughts should be kept uppermost in mind. One is: Never sell a stock, because it seems high-priced. You may watch the stock go from 10 to 50 and decide that it is selling at too high a level. That is the time to determine what is to prevent it from starting at 50 and going to 150 under favorable earning conditions and good corporate management. Many have lost their capital funds by selling a stock short after a long upward movement, when it seemed too&amp;nbsp;high.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, never buy a stock because it has had a big decline from its previous high. The likelihood is that the decline is based on a very good reason. That stock may still be selling at an extremely high price—even if the current level seems low. Try to forget its past high range and study it On the basis of the formula which combines timing and&amp;nbsp;price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may surprise many to know that in my method of trading, when I see by my records that an upward trend is in progress, I become a buyer as soon as a stock makes a new high on its movement, after having had a formal reaction. The same applies whenever I take the short side. Why? Because I am following the trend at the time. My records signal me to go ahead! I never buy on reactions or go short on&amp;nbsp;rallies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other point: It, is foolhardy to make a second trade, if your first trade shows you a loss. Never average Losses. Let that thought be written indelibly upon your&amp;nbsp;mind.&lt;/p&gt;

An alternative to actually buying the commodity or the upstream oil companies 
I may be wrong, of&amp;nbsp;course!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Inflation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world has experienced low or negative inflation.
This is a great worry to central bankers, and the pandemic, which has shut down large parts of economies has created huge output gaps.
Given the unwillingness (so far) of most governments to enact fiscal stimulus on the scale required to offset the drop in demand (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; down 10% in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; last year), the bankers have decided that their only option is to &amp;#8220;go&amp;nbsp;big.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generals always fight yesterday&amp;#8217;s battles. 
Central bankers may just have reached the age when the rapid inflations of the 1980&amp;#8217;s are no longer a  searing memory.
Certainly, thirty years of deflation in Japan has convinced a lot of us that loose monetary policy does not inevitably lead to inflation, in an economy with a strong currency and current account&amp;nbsp;surplus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://corporate.nordea.com/article/63558/fx-weekly-roses-are-red-violets-are-blue-the-ecb-is-more-infantile-than-both-me-and-you"&gt;Nordea has contempt for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  But also has a lot of interesting analysis on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FI&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt;. The theme of this week&amp;#8217;s missive is mis-measurement of official inflation statistics. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; is criticized for not estimating the &amp;#8220;rent of shelter&amp;#8221; component (which has a massive 40% weighting in core &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPI&lt;/span&gt;) plausibly, and the Statistics Sweden for fudging the notorious &amp;#8216;hedonic adjustments&amp;#8217; to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPI&lt;/span&gt;:  &lt;em&gt;Statistics Sweden is close to world-leading in quality-adjusting &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPI&lt;/span&gt; numbers so as to remove inflation.&lt;/em&gt; You even get black Scandinavian humour in this newsletter! 
Actionable trades are always thin here, but the summary is that even in Europe there is likely to be record-breaking growth, and a pickup in yield and&amp;nbsp;inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thesoundingline.com/gold-is-a-hedge-against-negative-real-rates-not-inflation-which-is-the-fed-really-targeting/"&gt;Taps Coogan says that gold bugs are wrong&lt;/a&gt; to argue that gold will go up because inflation is about to take off. He suggest that what happens to gold will depend on exactly how willing the Fed is willing to tolerate inflation, and with it ever-increasing negative real&amp;nbsp;rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Recycling, Chinese&amp;nbsp;style&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://moneyinsideout.exantedata.com/p/chinas-balance-of-payments-part-ii"&gt;This post from Money: Inside and Out&lt;/a&gt; gives some analysis of the capital account for China, which is in deficit to exactly the same amount as the current account is in surplus.
The year of 2020 has been particularly tough: China has continued running its factories at near capacity, but the rest of the world has produced virtually nothing. Even President Xi&amp;#8217;s promise to buy more &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; soybeans didn&amp;#8217;t get delivered. Maybe he took a gamble on how the election would turn&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post is highly technical, but my take is that this will put further downward pressure on the dollar (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt;). 
Currency movements are hard to forecast, and will go against fundamentals for career lifetimes, but the weight on the dollar is getting&amp;nbsp;heavier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Revolut&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read a long article int the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; over the weekend,  about Revolut.
The article pointed out that this &amp;#8216;fintech&amp;#8217; company had a market cap larger than 
Ireland&amp;#8217;s largest bank. I have a Revolut card. It&amp;#8217;s good, but &lt;em&gt;it&amp;#8217;s just a credit card&lt;/em&gt;. 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, they don&amp;#8217;t try to gouge you with crap &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt; rates like the banks do,
but most people who need &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt; know that the banks will always try to rip them off,
and that there are lots of much cheaper alternatives.
How being one in a million cheap &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt; offers help (I also use TransferWise, which seems better for larger transactions).
Revolut offer gambling on Bitcoins. Is this a sensible thing to combine with a credit card?
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; (I&amp;#8217;m a) Boomer. Maybe I just don&amp;#8217;t get it.
[I actually wrote this nearly a year ago, but in a post where it didn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;fit.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was President&amp;#8217;s Day: a holiday for many &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shipping, both container and bulk, is a very unloved sector. There cycle is long, and it takes a long time to build a ship.
I think we&amp;#8217;re going through a cyclical up phase, as commodities (oil, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LNG&lt;/span&gt;, coal, lumber, grains) start to move after the pandemic.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SB&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NMM&lt;/span&gt; might be a way to play this, although I like $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;STNG&lt;/span&gt;, which has a 9.5% short interest, and yet a free cashflow per share of $2 on a share price of&amp;nbsp;$16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platinum seems to be going hyperbolic (in coverage, at least). It is spiking&amp;nbsp;higher:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="650" height="420" src="https://app.koyfin.com/share/88f7b98cfa/simple" frameBorder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we ever get fuel cells to work properly, we may need a lot of this, and in any case it might have a considerable use in hydrogen&amp;nbsp;transport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk-on, deflationary day&amp;nbsp;today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;every global equity market up (especially&amp;nbsp;Japan),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;commodities (non-monetary) all up, except soybeans. Brent crude is pushing&amp;nbsp;$60.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; down (90.333), &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBP&lt;/span&gt; being the winner (up to&amp;nbsp;$1.39)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Govt. bond yields up absolutely&amp;nbsp;everywhere. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, stocks will use any excuse to rally. Central banks are all saying they&amp;#8217;ll tolerate any level of inflation to get unemployment down, which is enough to light the fire under commodities and equities. Bonds weaker as a&amp;nbsp;result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://termbin.com/fg3y"&gt;Carson Block nails it&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/dbfc69df-7dbc-4338-a475-1432ffdc4056"&gt;also at&lt;/a&gt; but probably paywalled: I put up a temporary text extract because I think this is so important: I think if you just search for &amp;#8220;The &amp;#8216;stonk&amp;#8217; bubble poses significant global risks&amp;#8221;  you&amp;#8217;ll find it. It&amp;#8217;s on Zerohedge &lt;a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/stonk-bubble-poses-significant-global-risk"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; but Twitter seems to find &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZH&lt;/span&gt; threatening). Block basically endorses Michael Green&amp;#8217;s theory that passive investing just creates an unstable feedback loop. With a fixed stock of equities to buy, and passive funds essentially forced to buy, at any price (because they can&amp;#8217;t leave investor&amp;#8217;s money in cash) a modest level of inflow from active to passive, and from stimulus check to passive, drives up stock prices &amp;#8216;exponentially.&amp;#8217;  &lt;em&gt;Green estimates that when a passive fund receives an additional dollar, the automatic decision to maintain balance by buying in proportion to market capitalisation results in an increase in market cap of more than $17!&lt;/em&gt; (I put &amp;#8216;exponentially&amp;#8217; to mean &amp;#8216;rapidly&amp;#8217; because it&amp;#8217;s clear that nobody uses the word in its original meaning any longer. Originally, the word meant with a rate of change which is proportional to the value of that which is&amp;nbsp;growing.) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://thesoundingline.com/m1-money-supply-growth-hits-jaw-dropping-75-money-velocity-wont-save-us-from-inflation/"&gt;The problem of velocity&lt;/a&gt;. Taps Coogan discusses the missing link between increasing the money supply and triggering inflation. He points out that demand leaks out in an open economy (which characterises the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; and Japan more than the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;) . &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt; doesn&amp;#8217;t generate money: it just moves it around between the Treasury General Account and the Fed. However, Biden&amp;#8217;s stimulus fiscal policy will put money into the hands of consumers who will spend it. An unalloyed good&amp;nbsp;thing!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2021/02/13/boris-johnsons-nhs-prescription-more-control-less-competition"&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; is getting re-organized again&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing good will come of this. By centralizing control, you end up with a health system that is driven by ever changing political expediency rather than long-term assessed health benefits. This is the reason that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; employs no health economists. Nobody cares about maximizing Quality Adjusted Life Years any more compared to preventing the closure of a creaking old wreck of a hospital in a marginal&amp;nbsp;constituency.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kolanovic: &amp;#8220;We believe that the last supercycle peaked in 2008 (after 12 years of expansion), bottomed in 2020 (after a 12-year contraction) and that we likely entered an upswing phase of a new commodity supercycle. Mostly it will be the story of a post-pandemic recovery (‘roaring 20s’), ultra-loose monetary and fiscal policies, weak &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;, stronger inflation, and unintended consequences of environmental policies and their friction with physical constraints related to energy consumption and&amp;nbsp;production&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; stocks up, high beta&amp;nbsp;effect?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All non-money commodities up: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CL1&lt;/span&gt; up 2.35%, Brent same, only nickel taking a&amp;nbsp;pause,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;govt. bond yields up everywhere, 5bp for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; 10&amp;nbsp;year,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;currencies fairly flat (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; up 0.03% to&amp;nbsp;90.448).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; down 0.65%, but now standing at&amp;nbsp;$47.7K. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, vaccine rollouts getting better, governments promising to spend more money, central banks promising to let the economy run hot, economic data utterly terrible but no worse than expected (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; economy down 9.9%, worse than the 1920&amp;#8217;s including the year of the General&amp;nbsp;Strike).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Worth a&amp;nbsp;listen&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://macromusings.libsyn.com/robert-kaplan-on-the-feds-new-framework-inflation-and-the-post-covid-economy"&gt;David Beckworth interviews Robert Kaplan&lt;/a&gt;.
Central banks are very important in the modern world, and if you have a chance to hear a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CB&lt;/span&gt; chairman speak unscriptedly, it&amp;#8217;s worth taking it.
Kaplan almost comes close to admitting that the Fed is creating severe distortions in the economy but just manages to say this side of the line.
My take was that the Fed will not tighten before inflation is practically&amp;nbsp;roaring.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>“The trick is to buy before the price moves”</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/the-trick-is-to-buy-before-the-price-moves.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-02-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:49+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-02-11:/the-trick-is-to-buy-before-the-price-moves.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;

The suggestion is that the BoJ will move away from yield curve control of the long end.
It&amp;#8217;s hard to imagine there are any &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JGB&lt;/span&gt; traders still working, it&amp;#8217;s been so long since trading the things was remotely profitable. We know that Japan lead the rest of the world into Financial Repression. Maybe it will lead it out of it, which would be music to the ears of bond bears (except they are&amp;nbsp;extinct).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="6d113b48fe55240629128a2dcc266c57.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/6d113b48fe55240629128a2dcc266c57.png"&gt;
Fannie Mae &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; are doing more business. We know how this ended last time. But surely, this time it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; different?&amp;nbsp;S&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="29d40f1e54b82af1d391756d4c8547ad.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/29d40f1e54b82af1d391756d4c8547ad.png"&gt;
Absence may makes the heart grow fonder, but not necessarily for the original object of&amp;nbsp;affection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My summary of &lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/"&gt;The Market Ear&lt;/a&gt; for yesterday (sorry, it&amp;#8217;s now&amp;nbsp;paywalled):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the market has recovered strongly since the $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GME&lt;/span&gt; fiasco, with a lot of short positions closed. There are almost no shorts left, everyone is long; put/call ratios are at record low, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; is (relatively) crushed. [My take: there are no more good news stories to be released].  The only way the market can go from here is down. This sounds plausible, but we&amp;#8217;ve been here a thousand times&amp;nbsp;before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CDX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IG&lt;/span&gt;: investment grade credit default swaps index (I think) has not moved since last Sept. It&amp;#8217;s hard to square this against the behaviour of the equities market, which has been stellar. Once of these groups of investors is&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Russell 2000/Nasdaq ratio is a measure of duration exposure, as is the 2 year 10 year spread. These have moved closely together, as the chart shows but maybe we are due for a retrace. &lt;img alt="c94ec12e6d1fc54fb71915eb46853772.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/c94ec12e6d1fc54fb71915eb46853772.png"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; chart showing exhaustion, (don&amp;#8217;t do&amp;nbsp;it!),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;oil getting ahead of&amp;nbsp;itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/09/health/universal-coronavirus-vaccine.html"&gt;Maybe we should aim for a single vaccine which works against all corona viruses&lt;/a&gt;. A number of groups have worked on a variety of different coronaviruses, including the original variants that caused &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SARS&lt;/span&gt; (and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MERS&lt;/span&gt;) and (of potentially great utility) the Common&amp;nbsp;Cold. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UBER&lt;/span&gt; is down a lot in ride sharing (27% Q4, but most of the hit taken by the drivers, which doesn&amp;#8217;t impact the P&amp;amp;L, presumably) but up a lot in food delivery. It lost $68B on a revenue of $11.1B. It&amp;#8217;s trading at 7.4 times consensus revenue, with 34 analysts rating it a &amp;#8220;buy&amp;#8221; (with one &amp;#8220;sell&amp;#8221;). Read more &lt;a href="https://www.grantspub.com/almostDailyHTML.cfm?dcid=805&amp;amp;article=2"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (you may have to register and log in but it is not&amp;nbsp;paywalled).  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reuter&amp;#8217;s headline is “Global stocks nudge higher, sustained by bottomless stimulus.”  This more or less sums up the last 20&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oil weakened, for no clear reason except maybe&amp;nbsp;exhaustion,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; economy to shrink by 10% (spot on forecast): the biggest drop ever. Markets&amp;nbsp;slept.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Dutch index, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AEX&lt;/span&gt; reached a 20 year high, of 667.96 in&amp;nbsp;Amsterdam,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this was generally a risk off day, but also deflationary day, with long-duration stocks (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt;) benefiting at the expense of short duration (&amp;#8216;value&amp;#8217;)&amp;nbsp;stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Worth&amp;nbsp;reading&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/11/opinion/california-san-francisco-schools.html"&gt;This &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NY&lt;/span&gt; Times Editorial&lt;/a&gt; explains why California is such a disaster for poor people, in spite of being by far the most progressive state in the union. 
Reasons&amp;nbsp;include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;non-selective, non-rigorous state (&amp;#8216;public&amp;#8217;) schools which are so bad most better off &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CA&lt;/span&gt; residents have no option but to pay for private&amp;nbsp;schooling,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;very onerous building codes that make new builds very expensive, with a result in very low rate of&amp;nbsp;housebuilding,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lots of consultations and regulations to protect existing residents against adverse nearby developments, with the result that it&amp;#8217;s almost impossible to build a homeless hostel&amp;nbsp;anywhere, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lots of green virtue signalling that has resulted in expensive and impractical projects like high speed&amp;nbsp;rail,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an old finding in political science that Americans are “symbolically conservative” but “operationally liberal.” Americans talk like conservatives but want to be governed like liberals. In California, the same split political personality exists, but in reverse: We’re often symbolically liberal, but operationally conservative. Renaming closed schools is an almost novelistically on-point example, but it is not the most&amp;nbsp;consequential.&lt;/p&gt;

We have abundant physical capital, and financial capital for materially net negative interest rates.
We have labour utilitization which is way below 100, even for prime age workers, 
not to mention the reserve army of the recently retired (which have done a lot of the vaccine administration in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="2ec5247bbdbc1ddad356fbf03e4bf48a.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/2ec5247bbdbc1ddad356fbf03e4bf48a.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know the mass media in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; is not the most trustworthy, but when 90% of the supporters of any mass appeal party don&amp;#8217;t believe what they read in the papers, we are in serious trouble. 
One dreads to think about what they believe is a trustworthy source of&amp;nbsp;news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities pretty flat.
Bonds up (i.e. yields down).
Pretty much no change in yield curve steepness. Curves still very flat: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DE&lt;/span&gt; has 26bp between 2s and 10s.
Currencies pretty flat: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EURUSD&lt;/span&gt; no&amp;nbsp;change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No real news. Some political wrangling. Some Big Tech co&amp;#8217;s investing in EVs. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FB&lt;/span&gt; coming out with a Clubhouse&amp;nbsp;clone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart of the&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; has had a pretty terrible economic time since 2008. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; per capita, on a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PPP&lt;/span&gt; basis, has gone up by only 5% since 2008, over the course of more than twelve years, i.e. around 40bp a year. A most miserable decade (or&amp;nbsp;so).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, a risk-neutral day. 
Nothing moved very much, apart from Bitcoin, which is being pumped relentlessly by Elon Musk. 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; is down, with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBPUSD&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EURUSD&lt;/span&gt; both up approx 0.56%.
Commodities are taking a pause, in spite of the weakening of the dollar. No consistent movement, although some largish moves (e.g. Cu up over&amp;nbsp;1%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Alex Manzara always comes up with an interesting weekend post. &lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/cross-of-inflation/"&gt;Last week&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; was no different. His comments range from a look at the underperformance of commodities relative to stocks over 30 years, and the meaning of the famous &amp;#8220;Cross of gold&amp;#8221; speech, by William Jennings Bryan in 1896. In fact &amp;#8212; and I hadn&amp;#8217;t understood this &amp;#8212; it was a cry for looser monetary conditions. It&amp;#8217;s amazing to think how little has changed in well over a&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; continues to crash.
&lt;img alt="c55feec446f30ac95bce90676669c78f.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/c55feec446f30ac95bce90676669c78f.png"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massive risk-on day. Supposedly explained by the fact that the stimulus bill in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; is going to be passed, but really just because of a burst of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOMO&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;European bond yields generally up, except Italy, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; 30-year is now yielding more than&amp;nbsp;2%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;almost all commodities up, except a couple of lightly traded foodstuffs (cocoa, coffee, milk &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; sugar!!), nickel at a six-year&amp;nbsp;high,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nearly all &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; and European equity markets&amp;nbsp;up,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most currencies flat, although &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AUD&lt;/span&gt; was up 0.38% vs &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;, presumably because of the strength of&amp;nbsp;commodities,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin has gone ballistic, as Elon Musk says that Tesla has purchased $1.5B worth of it (more than it spends in a year on&amp;nbsp;R&amp;amp;D!).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://compoundadvisors.com/2021/8-to-80-spotlight-google-2-4-21"&gt;Google is an amazing business&lt;/a&gt;. This is a great history of the company, and has a few choice quotes from people who didn&amp;#8217;t believe that it was ever going to make money. Clearly, it did, and it is continuing to do so. However, it&amp;#8217;s hard to see that it can continue it&amp;#8217;s vertical ascent without someone eventually realizes that it has a vast market share &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; makes a vast amount of money. Governments have the power to sell monopolies, which they have over time immemorial, and also to regulate them and extract large rents from them. Of course, the smart people at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; are perfectly aware of this, which is why they make sure they are hyperconnected to politicians in all countries (&lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3418036/The-incredibly-close-links-Google-Downing-Street-decades.html"&gt;this is England&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;How to profit from Biden&amp;#8217;s Green&amp;nbsp;Policies&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/04b9376c-6f7d-49b3-9d36-94302e9e4fcc"&gt;This wonderful article by John Dizard&lt;/a&gt; explains that one of the biggest financial beneficiaries of new policies enacted by the incoming &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; administration are knackered electric utilities that generate power from coal. 
The point is that they will be paid to close, and given a very generous regulated return on new investment in green transmission and&amp;nbsp;generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a quick scan on suitable stocks and came up with this list (which is not based on a lot of&amp;nbsp;research):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AGR&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYSE&lt;/span&gt;, Avangrid&amp;nbsp;Inc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DUK&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYSE&lt;/span&gt;, Duke Energy&amp;nbsp;Corporation&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea whether this makes sense as an investing idea, but it is a great example of how the best laid plans can go horribly&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Trading&amp;nbsp;Ideas&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All real assets have benefited tremendously from the massive injections of liquidity carried out by central banks generally, but the Fed in particular. Stan Druckenmiller has made some comments about where he sees value going forward(See &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DivergentVentur/status/1357459321609723915"&gt;this tread by @DivergentVentur&lt;/a&gt; for the detail).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TL&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DR&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;M2 explosion will trigger&amp;nbsp;inflation,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Fed will start yield curve control, so there is no point in going short long-dated&amp;nbsp;Treasuries,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the monetary expansion will eventually bleed through into &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; (not yet&amp;nbsp;tho!),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;commodities (maybe via miners/producers) is a way to&amp;nbsp;profit,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; could do well, because a lot of other stocks are&amp;nbsp;terrible,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asia, especially Asian tech and currencies will be a good place to shelter from the fallout of the exploding&amp;nbsp;deficit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy is likely to benefit. Coal (especially) and oil (quite a lot) have been beaten down a lot by the assumption that everyone in China and India will be driving around in a Tesla in a year or so&amp;#8217;s time. I can&amp;#8217;t quite believe it myself, and &amp;#8212; in any case &amp;#8212; those batteries ain&amp;#8217;t gonna charge themselves, and will largely depend on smokey old power stations to generate the electricity they&amp;nbsp;need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart of the&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value plotted is the instantaneous expectation of average inflation over a five year period, that period starting in five years time. It&amp;#8217;s derived fromt he prices of regular treasuy notes and bonds, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TIPS&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8212; inflation protected securities. It shows that the market expects that the rate will be above 2% for a sustained period, and that expectation is not reversing (over a smoothed&amp;nbsp;timescale).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risk on,&amp;nbsp;again: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All major equity markets up, except &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; and Germany. Russell 2000 hits and all-time&amp;nbsp;high,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Govt. bond yields up almost everywhere (exception: Italy and France, due to credit effects); general&amp;nbsp;steepening,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All crypto&amp;nbsp;up,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; down, 0.6%, reaction to yesterday&amp;#8217;s strength,&amp;nbsp;presumably.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News was not&amp;nbsp;heavy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; consumer credit a bit weak (nowhere open to spend on your credit&amp;nbsp;card),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bank of England ruled out negative rates and lowered its forecast for the rest of the&amp;nbsp;year,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; currencies strong (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MXP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BRL&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Reflections&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A universal characteristic of humanity since the invention of agriculture has been organized religion.
Many, if not all, political movements have a strong religious affiliation, and almost no mainstream politician ever dare say anything negative about religion. 
Observance, if not unconditional faith, has been the norm in &amp;#8216;civilized&amp;#8217; societies. 
Communities and &amp;#8216;faith-based&amp;#8217; communities used to be the same thing.
Societies with shared culture and norms function better than those with atomized ones.
Along with the collapse in religious observance has been a failure of the nuclear family as the bedrock of society.
I sound like the a boomer I am, but these changes in the way we live have occurred without debate, political or otherwise.
Institutions like the Roman Catholic church, which have weathered the storms of millennia have suddenly experience a hemorrhage of members, without anyone having a convincing&amp;nbsp;explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick google throws up some explanations (e.g. &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/09/atheism-fastest-growing-religion-us/598843/"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;) but I am not&amp;nbsp;convinced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious question for anybody who spends at least two seconds looking at the graph above is: &lt;em&gt;What the hell happened around&amp;nbsp;1990?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Christian Smith, a sociology and religion professor at the University of Notre Dame, America’s nonreligious lurch has mostly been the result of three historical events: the association of the Republican Party with the Christian right, the end of the Cold War, and&amp;nbsp;9/11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These simply do not explain the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;experience. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>“All systems go”</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/all-systems-go.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-02-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:49+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-02-04:/all-systems-go.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;li&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IYR&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARCA&lt;/span&gt; (iShares &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;REIT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt;) has short interest of 19.15% and an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IV&lt;/span&gt; of under 20%. Just&amp;nbsp;sayin&amp;#8217;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4403207-economy-is-gaining-steam"&gt;There is some evidence that a $1.9T stimulus package will make a difference&lt;/a&gt;. Would would have thought&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/K_u2AI7ZWAk"&gt;Stanley Druckenmiller thinks this is the wildest time he&amp;#8217;s ever known&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“In three months we increased the deficit increase more than if you took the last five recessions combined and those were big ones… The Fed in six weeks bought more treasuries than they did in ten years under Bernanke and Yellen when people like me were screaming about how excessive &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; was during that period. Corporate borrowing, which almost always goes down during a recession as corporations reliquefy, and had already gone from $6 trillion to $10 trillion because of the free money going into the period, actually went up $400 billion. Just to put that in perspective, it went down $500 billion during the Great Financial&amp;nbsp;Crisis…”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It’s possible, in fact probable, that all this stimulus is still going to be in place and frankly increasing just when we release the biggest increase in pent up demand globally that we’ve had maybe since the 1920s, which could make the world look extremely different than&amp;nbsp;today.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I would say that my overriding theme is inflation relative to what the policy makers&amp;nbsp;think.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk on,&amp;nbsp;again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; equities at all time highs (most&amp;nbsp;indexes),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; up 0.4%, putting pressure on commodity prices, although oil and gas continue to climb with promise of vaccine-driven recovery. Supposedly, this is a result of treasury yields rising, but, in my day, covered interest arbitrage was a&amp;nbsp;thing! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 year Treasurys reach 1.14%. Up&amp;nbsp;0.8bp!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;European equities&amp;nbsp;strong,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cryptocurrencies are exploding (Elon Musk pumped Dogecoin&amp;nbsp;). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the economic recovery is still driving a risk-on take. Long duration stocks like the Famous Five (aka &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt;, aka &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANGMAN&lt;/span&gt;) were all up strongly. At some point treasuries must weaken, or the stronger dollar will kill the recovery and treasuries will strengthne, but the current setup doesn&amp;#8217;t seem&amp;nbsp;stable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is, how much responsibility does the Fed have in all of this, and Powell answered that question at Wednesday’s press conference.  “None.”  When asked about financial stability, in a broad reply he referred to banking stress tests for the system as a whole.  When Steve Liesman pressed and asked whether “super easy” monetary policy has created a bubble, Powell responded that what was primarily ‘driving asset prices’ was vaccine progress and fiscal policy, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; monetary policy.  Of course, the Fed has been vocal in urging more of a fiscal response, but never mind that.  He said the Fed had not at all considered raising margin requirements, and that issues of financial stability could be handled with macroprudential tools (without specifically naming any of those tools). It could be construed as somewhat disingenuous for the Fed to take credit for reducing employment while shunning blame for asset price instability.  In an interview on Friday, Mary Daly of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SF&lt;/span&gt; Fed took that issue head on: “I am not willing to pull that bridge [monetary accommodation] away and injure, in my judgment, the livelihoods of people – because they don’t have jobs, they don’t have income, they don’t have wage growth – simply to ensure that some people who already have stock market wealth don’t get&amp;nbsp;more.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly Powell was miffed at Dudley’s assertion that a taper tantrum would be “inevitable”.  It was during that part of the press conference that Powell went to great pains to say that the Fed is a long way from exit and would communicate such plans well in advance.  He also gave some insight into the Fed’s thinking on present conditions.  First, he echoed Brainard on upcoming strength in inflation measures due to base effects, as weak March and April data from last year fall out.  The Fed will look past the data as there are significant pockets of unemployment and slack resource use.  Regarding strength in housing, he mostly considers it a one-time shift with transitory effects.  In short, he emphasized long-term disinflationary forces, including demographics, technology, and&amp;nbsp;globalization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Myth and&amp;nbsp;Reality&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t post about Tesla much. There is nothing much more to say. It&amp;#8217;s the marquee stock of the 2020 bull market, and until it suffers serious weakness the bull market will remain intact.
Musk&amp;#8217;s ability to make the stock price levitate in the face of any quantity of sober  analysis demonstrating beyond any doubt that it is fundamentally worthless has inspired legions of followers including the ironically named &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/deepfuckingvalue"&gt;@deepfuckingvalue&lt;/a&gt;.
However, I am a great admirer of Montana Skeptic and I read with interest &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4401003-tesla-2021-great-expectations-and-inescapable-realities"&gt;his most recent post on Seeking Alpha&lt;/a&gt;.

It seems incredible that a few punks on Reddit can spook the whole of the hedge fund short selling crowd.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TBF&lt;/span&gt;, after Tesla, there can&amp;#8217;t be many of them left.
What is interesting, now, is who will buy when prices fade: there are no shorts left to&amp;nbsp;cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guys at The Market Ear are&amp;nbsp;worried:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been an interesting period since Biden entered the house. Latest developments in equity markets have been extreme. There are many views on what is going on, who did what, who is to blame etc, but we leave this to you to&amp;nbsp;decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The run up to this latest mini correction has seen &amp;#8220;impressive&amp;#8221; price action in many assets and forcing most to join the momentum trades, from chasing bitcoin, Tesla, small caps and now lately the Reddit&amp;nbsp;shorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has created an interesting aggregate psychology of the crowd, all based on the same principles of greed and fear. Lot of newbies have joined the trading space. As &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GS&lt;/span&gt; pointed out earlier this week there are more than 50 million &amp;#8220;traders&amp;#8221; across the various trading Apps these days, and that figure has probably spiked after this&amp;nbsp;week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOMO&lt;/span&gt; aspects of trading has never been stronger. The new normal is having 40%,50%,60%, +100% returns. Risk is something people have not even spoken about, until this week. Frequent readers of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TME&lt;/span&gt; know our strong focus on managing your p/l via a rigorous risk management&amp;nbsp;methodology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people lack these skills, and at best follow some VaR model they hardly understand (at the institutional level). Rest of the crowd, majority of the new trading retail elite, at best have a stop loss strategy, but that&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the first chart is showing the imploded shorts in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt;. Thinking about the downside has been out of fashion. Long in pretty much anything has been well rewarded. This has led to people abandoning index shorts as hedging has lately been seen as &amp;#8220;only costing money&amp;#8221;. Bottom line is shorts are at extremely low&amp;nbsp;levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about fear (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt;)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While people have puked shorts, the &amp;#8220;structural bid in volatility&amp;#8221; has continued to trade with a strong bid during the entire autumn. Recall our various posts regarding the strong bid in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VVIX&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; has traded extremely strong for months and has been indicating &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; at low 20&amp;#8217;s (despite low realized vols back then) was simply too low given the trajectory of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VVIX&lt;/span&gt;. Things obviously changed this&amp;nbsp;week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem for most &amp;#8220;pundits&amp;#8221; is they saw &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; as too high in the low 20&amp;#8217;s and investment banks have all been in &amp;#8220;sell &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; and vol&amp;#8221; mode. After the Georgia run off, all we have seen is sell volatility notes from&amp;nbsp;banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this time around people dismissed hedging for several&amp;nbsp;reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are long, have poured record amount of money into equity longs recently, puked shorts, dismissed having vol hedges/downside protection and then &amp;#8220;suddenly&amp;#8221; the most ironic catalyst, a giant short squeeze in &amp;#8220;hot&amp;#8221; names, creates a massive de-leveraging and hits VaR&amp;nbsp;hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second chart shows the huge move in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VVIX&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; is trying to catch up to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VVIX&lt;/span&gt; gap we have been pointing out for weeks, but &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VVIX&lt;/span&gt; remains well&amp;nbsp;bid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third chart shows &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; and the 2/8 month &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; futs spread. The recent panic bid in short term maturities has seen the spread explode to the upside. The crowd has gone from hating protection, to &amp;#8220;must buy&amp;#8221; it at any price. The most &amp;#8220;bang for the buck&amp;#8221; in term of gamma risk is in the short term maturities, so despite these costing less in terms of premium, people bid up the short end of the curve just to get as much protection as they can for the &amp;#8220;sudden&amp;#8221; moves (this is (still) not a vega&amp;nbsp;squeeze).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stress this time is huge. All things equal the 2/8 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; spread should be less sensitive as the corona stress should have been ebbing out by now, but note that the move in the spread now is similar to the first part of the sell off during the corona crisis. Back then &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; was down approx 12% when the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; 2/8 months spread reached similar levels to where we are trading now. So far &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; is down some 3.5% from all time highs. No, it does not mean we must crash another 9% from here just because the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; 2/8 spread is trading the way it is, but it shows the extreme stress this market is pricing, despite the moves actually rather small so&amp;nbsp;far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weekend has provided some extra time for risk managers and head traders/CIOs to stress test books and scenarios. Expect next week to be as &amp;#8220;dynamic&amp;#8221; as this week turned out to&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Best quote relating to the Reddit&amp;nbsp;Rampage&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex Manzara is wonderful. He quoted&amp;nbsp;this: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear? That’s the other guy’s problem.  Nothing you have ever experienced will prepare you for the absolute carnage you ae about to witness.  Super Bowl, World Series – they don’t know what pressure is.  In this building, it’s either kill or be killed.  You make no friends in the pits and you take no prisoners.  One minute you’re up half a million in soybeans and next, boom, your kids don’t go to college and they’ve repossessed your Bentley.  Are you with&amp;nbsp;me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the context, click &lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/fear-thats-the-other-guys-problem/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The Tuesday post, which is referenced in this post, is &lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/gamers/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. When insiders like Alex are disgusted by what is going on in the Fed, the whole system has got to be rotten. This is not one of the Redditors sounding&amp;nbsp;off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was definitely risk&amp;nbsp;on/deflationary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt; futures up&amp;nbsp;1.75%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nearly all commodities up: uranium &amp;gt;10%, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PAAS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UP&lt;/span&gt; 12% (the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WSB&lt;/span&gt; crowd talking about ramping&amp;nbsp;silver), &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GLD&lt;/span&gt; up 1% (probably dragged up by&amp;nbsp;silver),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TIP&lt;/span&gt; down&amp;nbsp;0.2%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TLT&lt;/span&gt; up&amp;nbsp;4bp,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nat Gas. up&amp;nbsp;10%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bitcoin down&amp;nbsp;2.4%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; down&amp;nbsp;0.5%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Thought for&amp;nbsp;tonight&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When governments throw a lot of money at a project, it&amp;#8217;s easy to get carried away by technological success, without examining the economics. 
When Apollo 11 reached the moon, all the pundits confidently stated that this would be the beginning of a new age: the Space Age. The reality is that we&amp;#8217;ve never really made any use of the exploration of space, and it has brought mankind no tangible benefit. At its peak, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Space program was burning through 5% of its &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;. This represented a huge loss of welfare for its citizens. Until recently, this sort of spending could have paid for free healthcare for all (until the 90&amp;#8217;s the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; was spending of this order of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; on its single-payer health service, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;br&gt;
We had similar promises about the Atomic Age in the fifties. 
I would not want to downplay the success of the pharma companies in producing a vaccine against &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SARS&lt;/span&gt;-Cov2, but this was not the result of a lot of committees in Whitehall deciding what the country needed to spend resources on.
Sometimes, being reactive is a good&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/p&gt;

Eric does a good job of channelling Lacey Hunt, but even Lacey admits that if the Fed printing seeps out into the pockets of real consumers all bets are&amp;nbsp;off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart of the&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it had to be:
&lt;img alt="be1abc26c2b49909a8b525c100457eed.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/be1abc26c2b49909a8b525c100457eed.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Everyone and his dog is searching for the next short&amp;nbsp;squeeze&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4401937-reits-getting-short-squeezed"&gt;It may be $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CXW&lt;/span&gt; or $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CBLAQ&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OR&lt;/span&gt; $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PEI&lt;/span&gt;, or $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WPG&lt;/span&gt;, or $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SKT&lt;/span&gt;, or $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAC&lt;/span&gt;, or $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SRG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. 
(Yes, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CBLAQ&lt;/span&gt; is is bankrupt.) 
At some price, even the most egregious rubbish is worth buying.
Be careful, though: $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SRG&lt;/span&gt; dropped 12%&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Data Privacy&amp;nbsp;Day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was Data Privacy Day. 
It&amp;#8217;s not as widely celebrated as Christmas Day, but may be more important.
Privacy, including data privacy, is important for us as individuals, if we are to enjoy freedom.
The lack of it is important to governments, if they are to exercise control over their subjects, and is important to advertisers, if they are to maximize the effectiveness of their advertising.
In turn, it&amp;#8217;s important to big business, as they have no means of understanding their customers except by monitoring their behaviour.
The business model of a lot of very profitable firms, such as Facebook and Google (Alphabet), is predicated on us willingly gifting a huge amount of our online (and offline) behaviour to them in exchange for a free email address or a photo sharing platform. 
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; has, to its credit, tried to limit the uses of private data (or data that should be private), but it&amp;#8217;s very hard to enforce or police a law where the victims are unaware of how much has been taken away from&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No real human has the resources needed to read the terms and conditions of the various web services and apps we use, but at least think before signing up to any &amp;#8220;free&amp;#8221; service, and also think about alternatives to the obvious. 
Facebook is not the only place you can keep in touch with friends. Think about the fact that Apple is paid billions of dollars by Google to make it the default search app. Think about using Thunderbird, and think about whether you really want Google to be the default search engine of your browser. For that matter, think about using Firefox as a browser, rather than Chrome or Edge. These are not difficult things to do. Your data is valuable. Think before sharing&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairly heavily risk off/deflationary&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;major indexes down by&amp;nbsp;~2%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;food and gold up, copper and energy&amp;nbsp;down, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;currencies fairly&amp;nbsp;flat,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;govt. bond yields slightly&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No obvious driver (to me, anyway), but markets have had a good run, and maybe hedge funds are liquidating their shorts, and also liquidating their longs that hedged&amp;nbsp;them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, it&amp;#8217;s clear that $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GME&lt;/span&gt; is going to crash to earth and make a big splash, which will discourage the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RH&lt;/span&gt; crowd (who probably already think the game is rigged against them&amp;nbsp;anyway).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Short&amp;nbsp;selling&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of anger, and enthusiasm, about short selling.
My take on it is that all trades should be viewed as going long one asset, and short another.
This is easiest to understand in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt;, where both assets are regarded as money, but in different countries.
But &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FI&lt;/span&gt; markets are just swapping money now for money in the future (or &lt;em&gt;vice versa&lt;/em&gt;).
And equity markets are swapping cash for shares, or shares for cash. 
Shares are just one obligation of the company, the residual claim. 
They are very like bonds, except the holders swap a right to fixed dividends for a right to residual&amp;nbsp;income.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Mortgage REITs have lower rates</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/mortgage-reits-have-lower-rates.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-01-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:51+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-01-27:/mortgage-reits-have-lower-rates.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Mortgage&amp;nbsp;REITs&lt;/h1&gt;

If you add in households, active mutual funds, and passive mutual funds and ETFs this is 63% of the market. ~$36 Trillion. Hedge Funds own 3% of the $57 Trillion &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; equity market - so &amp;#8220;Retail&amp;#8221; is 12x more important than hedge funds. And in 2020 &amp;#8220;retail&amp;#8221; started trading. Prior to 2020, retail activity (single stocks and options) stayed flat for 20 years. 5 out of the top 10 largest call option volume days in history (data goes back to 1992), happened in 2021. To be continued, in a big way, and it will end like a Greek&amp;nbsp;tragedy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quant/Strat star Inigo at Sanford Bernstein: &amp;#8220;In anticipation of further reflation and rising nominal yields in the coming quarters, we decide to go tactically short low vol, which is now in-line with our recent tactical upgrade of value. Not only has low vol had a negative relationship with inflation/bond yields for the past 20 years, but valuations are also at historical extremes. While valuation alone isn’t catalyst for reversal, falling yields have has supported its re-rating – with inflation inflecting upward, low vol stocks become vulnerable to&amp;nbsp;underperformance&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;li&gt;everyone is fretting about the supply of semiconductors. And yet Intel ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;INTC&lt;/span&gt;) is in the doldrums. Taiwan Semi (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TMS&lt;/span&gt;) is a big player. $6723 (Renesas) and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NXP&lt;/span&gt; ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NXPI&lt;/span&gt;) maybe caught up in the tailwind.

&lt;li&gt;SPACs are going to the moon (uh, Space). There is a discussion on a recent Market Huddle.&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deal derby in corporate debt.  S&amp;amp;P Global reports this morning that domestic pro forma high-yield bond issuance reached $40.3 billion so far this month, surpassing the $38.3 billion last year to set a new high water mark for the opening month of the year. Last week alone saw 20 deals worth $16.4 billion according to Bank of America, making it the sixth-busiest week on record. Likewise, a slew of activity in the leveraged loan market yesterday featured some 17 deals coming to market according to Bloomberg, the busiest day since November&amp;nbsp;30.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More broadly, global corporate fundraising exceeded $400 billion through the first three weeks of the year according to data from Refinitiv, nearly double the 20-year average.  Of that sum, equity offerings accounted for $64 billion, blowing past the 2014 high-water mark near $40 billion, while blank-check companies (a.k.a. SPACs) raised $21 billion through today, already one quarter of the 2020 fundraising total, which itself exceeded all &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPAC&lt;/span&gt; fundraising from prior years&amp;nbsp;combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These guys just pile in on high short-interest stocks to pop them higher.

&lt;h1&gt;Bubbles&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 5 major financial bubbles since the 18th century have seen their relevant asset class rise by an average of 1400% before the crash. So, do not worry, if your particular position is not up 1400% yet you are fine, nothing bad will happen - just keep on&amp;nbsp;buying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="dab0a2c82c37b9c1bc939e5bb9af24b9.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/dab0a2c82c37b9c1bc939e5bb9af24b9.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citi:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CITI&lt;/span&gt; strategist sees a bubble, (perhaps) but argues it can get much bigger. It is a new chapter in the &amp;#8220;bubble bubble but absolutely no trouble&amp;#8221; book that the market currently is writing. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CITI&lt;/span&gt;: &amp;#8220;Global equities are looking increasingly frothy, but current performance and valuations still lag previous mega-bubbles. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASDAQ&lt;/span&gt; now trades on a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAPE&lt;/span&gt; of 58x compared to 113x in 2000, and Japan’s 83x in 1990. Investors worried about excess valuation should look outside &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; equities. And there is no bubble versus bonds. Past equity bubbles hit much higher valuations than now, but with bonds at 5-6% not 0-1%. Bonds were an obvious alternative once those bubbles burst. They are not now. And bubbles don’t burst easily. Perhaps equities are currently vulnerable to any hints of higher rates or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; tapering from central banks. But history suggests that bubbles can inflate even as rates start to rise. They are much more robust than we all&amp;nbsp;think&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Goldman thinks that things have got&amp;nbsp;bubbly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;European cheap labour in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/eb5e3bd7-c8bf-4934-b60e-0e49152183a5"&gt;This article by Sarah O&amp;#8217;Connor&lt;/a&gt; explains why it&amp;#8217;s perfectly rational for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; workers to choose not to do the work that is normally done by seasonal migrant fruit and veg. pickers who have previously come to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. 
It&amp;#8217;s not so difficult to&amp;nbsp;understand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the minimum wage means that you have to pick damn fast to be worth&amp;nbsp;employing,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if you are Bulgarian, you can spend half your year in a very cheap&amp;nbsp;place, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you have to work long hours and weekends, but have six months off: this just doesn&amp;#8217;t suit&amp;nbsp;locals,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you may have to move from farm to farm, living in very basic (but free) accommodation on the&amp;nbsp;farm,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the economics of food production in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, plus the political allergy to having rapidly increasing food prices mean that this is just always going to be a tough gig, compared to being an estate&amp;nbsp;agent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saved this outside the paywall &lt;a href="https://termbin.com/adxn"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It will disappear in a month or so. Sorry, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Fame at&amp;nbsp;last!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thesoundingline.com/"&gt;The Sounding Line&lt;/a&gt; gave me a shout-out &lt;a href="https://thesoundingline.com/what-drives-commodity-inflation/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Taps Coogan is always worth reading. And it&amp;#8217;s free (donation encouraged). I strongly suggest you check it&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, fairly risk neutral. 
Core Eurozone yields crammed down, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; pretty flat, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; going up.
Everything else&amp;nbsp;unremarkable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market seems to be taking a risk-on direction as the world wakes up to the fact that Biden in the White House and the mere existence of a few effective vaccines does not mean that the world is returning to normal any time&amp;nbsp;soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the markets have been risk off. Curves are flattening, equities are weak, as are&amp;nbsp;commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/ill-get-you-on-the-back-end/"&gt;Alex Manzara muses about eurodollar calendar spreads&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, he&amp;#8217;s saying (if I understand this post correctly) that we are going to see longer-dated rates rising sooner than most people&amp;nbsp;think. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed is pulling out all the stops:
&lt;img alt="9c6c1180225b2bf7df26247d003cb423.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/9c6c1180225b2bf7df26247d003cb423.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GME&lt;/span&gt; is genuinely insane. It&amp;#8217;s up 2221% from it&amp;#8217;s low of last year. It&amp;#8217;s structurally unprofitable and sells DVDs with software on out of high street shops. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s a short squeeze, but wtf? The assumption is that the Wall St Bets crowd from Reddit have ramped it. Good luck to them, I guess, but someone is going to end up as&amp;nbsp;bagholder.a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.grantspub.com/almostDailyHTML.cfm?dcid=792"&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IBM&lt;/span&gt; is on a slow decline into irrelevance&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s interesting how &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IBM&lt;/span&gt; was taking out regular advertisements in the Economist a few years ago announcing how it was so dominant in cloud computing. Obviously, the management understood what it needed to do, but failed to execute. Intel had better watch out that it doesn&amp;#8217;t follow &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IBM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s path from dominant supplier of processor hardware to an also-ran. Interestingly, as the Grant&amp;#8217;s article points out, it&amp;#8217;s software, not hardware, that is really the scalable competitive&amp;nbsp;advantage. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt; seems determined to launch a digital Euro. There are an awful lot of crypto currencies: it will be a crowded field. I guess, though, that as stable coins go one from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt; would be more credible than&amp;nbsp;most,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think I&amp;#8217;ve got the idea of what a cryptocurrency is, but when it comes to the fine distinction between &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt;, Bitcoin Cash and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTV&lt;/span&gt; I&amp;#8217;m stumped.  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; is going through the roof, but Tether (probably) is not. Understanding the difference might be important to avoid getting burned by Bitcoin. &lt;a href="https://unboundedcapital.com/"&gt;Unbounded Capital&lt;/a&gt; thinks that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BSV&lt;/span&gt; stands above the others. I don&amp;#8217;t know if this is true, but it&amp;#8217;s interesting to hear the&amp;nbsp;argument.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9c3ecb09-c4bd-4066-a462-af496725105d?mc_cid=b6e5c95122&amp;amp;mc_eid=8d66df2c11"&gt;Celebrated value investor chooses most hackneyed cliché in finance&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s that bloody frog, that would actually hop out of a warming pan, just like a human would when it got a bit warm. He&amp;#8217;s saying there are dangers in central banks ballooning their balance sheets. It&amp;#8217;s amazing that someone that rich can be so &amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp;unoriginal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another Kuppy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KEDM&lt;/span&gt; is out. He&amp;#8217;s recommending: $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CXW&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VRNT&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMC&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NGL&lt;/span&gt; (these two &amp;#8220;&amp;#8216;death&amp;#8217;s door stocks,&amp;#8221; which might linger a lot longer than put buyers expect), $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ODT&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXLG&lt;/span&gt; (&amp;#8220;Destination &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XL&lt;/span&gt;: clothing for fat people!&amp;#8221;). This is not investment advice, but &lt;a href="https://www.kedm.com"&gt;the service&lt;/a&gt; is great value at $0. It goes beyond the usual anodyne&amp;nbsp;comments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5d7757c8-eb63-4138-a6ab-6e2bb6ce8925"&gt;Jonathan Ford points out the problems with the way that renewable energy is paid for by generators&lt;/a&gt;. The problem is the well-known one, that renewal generation can be fiercely intermittent, and a lot of non-renewable (or nuclear) energy generating capacity is required to keep the lights&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://thesoundingline.com/given-todays-deficits-confiscating-100-of-the-top-1s-net-worth-would-only-fund-the-us-for-a-handful-of-years/"&gt;Wealth taxes are trickier than you think&lt;/a&gt;. The problem is that taxing wealth immediately reduces its value. &amp;#8220;Radical Markets&amp;#8221; by Weyl and Posner do examine this problem and have some answers, but it&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;complicated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap (for last&amp;nbsp;week)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;govt. bond yields start to ease back:&lt;img alt="638e6520b45e25ecac963e24c24a3ae7.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/638e6520b45e25ecac963e24c24a3ae7.png"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; equities have had a hell of a rally: maybe it&amp;#8217;s time to ease back. Especially as commodities seem to be&amp;nbsp;fading,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; indexes were green, from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NQ&lt;/span&gt; (4.19%) to the Dow&amp;nbsp;(0.59%).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap (for&amp;nbsp;today)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity indices very twitchy today. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; up, others sideways. Several of the big &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANGMAN&lt;/span&gt; names report their results this week. 
I assume this explains the move.
Feb 10Y Treasury Note future settled at 137-01.
Commodities mostly down, although nat. gas strong. Uranium participation up a whopping 7.8%!
Overall, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DBC&lt;/span&gt; (broad commodities &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt;) has been pretty strong&amp;nbsp;lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crazy games with &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/"&gt;Wall Street Bets&lt;/a&gt; driving $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GME&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BB&lt;/span&gt; to massive highs. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOK&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMC&lt;/span&gt; are next.
A lot of people are going to lose their shirts, but if you must, check the bets &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/?f=flair_name%3A%22YOLO%22"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Thought for the&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The future is already here, it&amp;#8217;s just not very evenly&amp;nbsp;distributed.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, the past is still with us, but more so.
And the past that is with is, is a reflection of how difficult it is to make progress with so many things.
Traffic in central London now travels more slowly than a hundred years ago.
All the intellectual and economic effort expended to improve this lamentable situation has failed.
Jet travel is slower now than it was in the fifties.
Nuclear power is more expensive now than it has ever been.
Most transport is as reliable on oil now as it has ever been.
The same goes for plastics and ammonia (for fertilizer).
Progress is hard. Governments have a very poor track record of achieving it by throwing money at the problem.
Maybe recent developments in vaccines are the example that tests that rule.
But success in vaccines was not achieved by government&amp;nbsp;fiat.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>CCS: Carbon Capture Stupidity</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/ccs-carbon-capture-stupidity.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-01-22T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:51+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-01-22:/ccs-carbon-capture-stupidity.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CCS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;viability&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TESLAcharts/status/1352430248273522693"&gt;There is a good thread from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which analyses the issues with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CCS&lt;/span&gt;. 
Essentially they boil down to the&amp;nbsp;economics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is no real economic use for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CO&lt;/span&gt;~2~ in the quantities it would need to be&amp;nbsp;produced,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the only economic use would be in increasing the yield …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CCS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;viability&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TESLAcharts/status/1352430248273522693"&gt;There is a good thread from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which analyses the issues with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CCS&lt;/span&gt;. 
Essentially they boil down to the&amp;nbsp;economics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;there is no real economic use for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CO&lt;/span&gt;~2~ in the quantities it would need to be&amp;nbsp;produced,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the only economic use would be in increasing the yield from oil wells, but that&amp;#8217;s not gonna get&amp;nbsp;subsidies,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it requires huge capital investment to build the infrastructure, which destroys&amp;nbsp;value,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it would need a lot of pipelines. People, and politicians, don&amp;#8217;t like&amp;nbsp;pipelines,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;universities may have shown prototype projects can work, but this is a million miles from doing something in the real&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this is correct, but I feel that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TC&lt;/span&gt; underestimates the theatrical aspect of politics. The fact that something is woefully uneconomic (in the sense that it destroys value for the whole population) has never been a great barrier to stopping politicians doing something. Look at the endless money thrown at the military industrial complex, and the never-ending wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The military industrial complex now has some strong competition from the green energy complex, and politicians know which of the two has the stronger buy-in from the voting&amp;nbsp;public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Hedge funds are &amp;#8216;all&amp;nbsp;in&amp;#8217;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="02e192a7d9fef3ed79528abe1da0a692.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/02e192a7d9fef3ed79528abe1da0a692.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Inflation may get&amp;nbsp;going&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thesoundingline.com/el-erian-if-more-stimulus-materializes-fed-will-have-hard-time-with-inflation-expectations/"&gt;El Erian warns again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said something similar, but at greater length &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bdff6e40-d150-4699-b3bf-4d56ced19090"&gt;in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but focussed on the potential political difficulties of building growth and productivity (which, of course, go together, especially in a static working age&amp;nbsp;population).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; vs &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that emerging markets are simply in a better shape than developed markets.
They don&amp;#8217;t have the burden of a huge public sector (60% in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; now) which will, eventually, translate into a huge tax burden. 
They have relatively little regulation, and are much less likely to intervene in private sector contracts (e.g. for labour or housing services). 
Obviously, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; has problems with corruption, which funnels resources to activities which do not benefit the majority, but this sort of sub-optimal allocation of governmental resources is not unknown in&amp;nbsp;DMs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All economies are moving towards being service based, but there is still a lot of manufacturing. 
Even in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, it amounts to 20%!  EMs are more commodity production based, and with commodities still at decade old lows, this will help, because whatever happens in the West, we&amp;#8217;ll need to eat, consume made items and use commodities for almost&amp;nbsp;everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, the most egregiously highly valued of all DMs is the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASDAQ&lt;/span&gt;. Europe and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; are probably not too&amp;nbsp;bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lacy Hunt: still bullish after all these&amp;nbsp;years&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lacey Hunt has produced &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4399720-hoisington-investment-management-q4-2020-investor-letter"&gt;a new quarterly report for Hoisington&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, he&amp;#8217;s saying that there is loads of spare capacity, and the fiscal multiplier  has actually turned negative (i.e. govts. deficit spending actively drains demand out of the economy). You can download it &lt;a href="https://hoisington.com/pdf/HIM2020Q4NP.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; directly from the Hoisington site. 
According to Hunt, fiscal spending fails to boost demand&amp;nbsp;when:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is spent on services (or&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8216;benefits/entitlements&amp;#8217;),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&amp;#8217;s in a country with a flexible exchange&amp;nbsp;rate,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in a country with an open&amp;nbsp;economy,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in a country which already has a large govt.&amp;nbsp;debt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he says, virtually all modern economies are highly indebted, and most meet the other criteria. 
Certainly, history shows that it&amp;#8217;s a lot harder to spark inflation than many had assumed, but the idea that yields on USTs will simply continue to fall indefinitely seems hard to countenance&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Charlie Bilello&amp;nbsp;replies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://compoundadvisors.com/2021/when-secular-trends-reverse"&gt;Charlie&amp;#8217;s latest post&lt;/a&gt; argues that the long straight road we&amp;#8217;ve been travelling on over several decades is starting to change direction. Specifically in the following&amp;nbsp;areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large Caps over Small&amp;nbsp;Caps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; over&amp;nbsp;International.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growth over&amp;nbsp;Value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tech over&amp;nbsp;Everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long Duration over Short Duration (Yields Falling, Curve&amp;nbsp;Flattening).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stocks over&amp;nbsp;Commodities. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These trends have been very strong and very enduring, but the set of charts he has produced make a compelling case.
I&amp;#8217;ll steal one, so you have to follow the link above to see the rest:
&lt;img alt="1287dc9f3ee7dfdded2c9c93bc9a88fc.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/1287dc9f3ee7dfdded2c9c93bc9a88fc.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I never stop writing about inflation, but I&amp;#8217;m not the only one fascinated to see what happens to&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My own preference is for theory over practice (a crippling weakness, I know), but for this argument, I am inclined to look at the charts and conclude that something has changed. 
In the 70&amp;#8217;s, nobody really seems to know, even now, what lead to the inflation surge. 
Maybe it was oil, maybe it was the end of financial repression. 
Who knows? But it&amp;#8217;s not as though inflation is dead: just ask the&amp;nbsp;Venezuelans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Short&amp;nbsp;ideas&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are mainly from &lt;a href="https://thebearcave.substack.com"&gt;the Bear Cave&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDQ&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EOSE&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8212; Eos Energy Enterprises: battery co. with no&amp;nbsp;revenue,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASX&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TYR&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8212; Tyro payments: failed software upgrade that put half of the merchant terminals out of action, (very old&amp;nbsp;tech).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYSE&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LMND&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8212; app-based insurance co.: insiders&amp;nbsp;selling,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASDAQ&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLSK&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8212; CleanSpark. Energy software co., insiders draining&amp;nbsp;liquidity,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASDAQ&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KIDS&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8212; pediatric orthopedatrics co. Fraud?&amp;nbsp;Culper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASDAQ&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOYU&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8212;&amp;nbsp;fraud,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I think these are all from the same source, but I noted them in a separate file and I&amp;#8217;m too lazy to go back and verify this&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current fevered bull market, it&amp;#8217;d be crazy to short the most egregious Ponzi scheme, but at some point the market will run out of steam, so it&amp;#8217;s as well to be&amp;nbsp;prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an outlier: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYSE&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;STPK&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8212; clean energy storage systems. This is a &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LONG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; idea from&amp;nbsp;Citron!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, a risk-on/low-inflation expectations&amp;nbsp;day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;all &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; equity sectors up, especially comms and&amp;nbsp;tech,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;credit and treasury yields up a&amp;nbsp;little,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed income fairly flat, except converts and high yield, which are up (in&amp;nbsp;price).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;global equity markets up (except Spain &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Portugal),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EUR&lt;/span&gt; is down against everything. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; down against almost everything (except &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EUR&lt;/span&gt;!),&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Rhodium hit new high, up 25% this month. Is Rh the new&amp;nbsp;Pd?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Janet Yellen, new Treasury Sec., announces stimulus of $1.9e12, and yet yields fall. All the normal functioning of markets has&amp;nbsp;stopped,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stocks higher (as always), with stimulus used as the explanation&amp;nbsp;today,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBP&lt;/span&gt; higher: fatigue&amp;nbsp;rally?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; crushed:&amp;nbsp;stimulus,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all non-bond-like sectors up (i.e. utilities, consumer staples &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; real estate&amp;nbsp;down),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury yields up, German Treasury yields down: as usual (but by a tiny bit in both&amp;nbsp;cases),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crude up ~2% (Brent), gas down. Most commods up, except silver, gas and a few&amp;nbsp;grains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Thought&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamental theorem of macroeconomics is that total production must equal total consumption.
Keynes said, correctly, that the sole purpose of economic activity was to consume.
If we equate utility with consumption, then to maximize utility is to maximize consumption.
From this we can conclude that productivity is everything, especially in the long run. 
Even if we think that the environment is very important, we should still be concerned about productivity, of the total factor sort, because we want to minimize our use of all the factors of production, such as&amp;nbsp;land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Productivity is difficult to measure, and so nobody seems entirely sure whether it&amp;#8217;s going up or going down.
Keeping it going up is a tough problem, because once we&amp;#8217;ve fixed productivity in one sector, it&amp;#8217;s importance in the economy goes right down. Agricultural labour is much, much more productive now than it was in 1700, but it now represents a vanishingly small part of the economy now, so that technology has to be applied in other areas to make an impact. The vast bulk of our consumption is of non-food&amp;nbsp;items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some services seem insanely difficult to make more productive. Not just the task of playing a Mozart quartet, but the business of moving a vehicle around in a big city. The average speed of a vehicle in recent years in central London is slower than it was a hundred years ago. Travel by commercial jet is now slower than it was fifty years ago. (The aeroplanes are not materially slower, but the time it takes to get through the airport is hugely&amp;nbsp;longer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk has promised to &amp;#8220;solve traffic&amp;#8221; by digging tunnels under big cities. 
In fact, even if he perfected the technology, he cannot do this, because this is under the control of local government,
and they won&amp;#8217;t let him.
As private-sector, free market services become more efficient, they themselves wither as a component of our consumption, leaving the sluggish government sector looming ever larger. 
In the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; in 2020, it&amp;#8217;s likely that the public sector bought over 60% of all goods and services. Clearly, this is largely a result of a sharp contraction in the private sector, but even a recovery will not halt the inexorable rise of the public sector.
I am not making the argument that this is a malign political conspiracy: it&amp;#8217;s just a reflection that all the easy tasks have been finished, leaving the only stuff left to do as difficult and doable, in practice, by the&amp;nbsp;government.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="economics"></category></entry><entry><title>MLK Day snooze</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/mlk-day-snooze.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-01-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:51+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-01-18:/mlk-day-snooze.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; on holiday, there was not much direction to the markets&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally, longer-term govt. yields were&amp;nbsp;up,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Energy&amp;nbsp;mixed,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most non-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; markets down, although Europe managed a&amp;nbsp;rally.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;M3, broad money, has risen by 400bln in the last year. This is about 20% of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;. At the moment, people are not spending this, but are forced savers. At some point, they will try to consume. If this doesn&amp;#8217;t jack up inflation, I don&amp;#8217;t know what will. It&amp;#8217;s very low now, but it rarely stays this low for&amp;nbsp;long:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="kedm.com"&gt;Kuppy&amp;#8217;s Event Driven&amp;nbsp;Monitor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuppy is a fixture on The Market Huddle podcast, and is always good to listen to.
He&amp;#8217;s started up a new venture, which is a newsletter devoted to &amp;#8220;event driven&amp;#8221; opportunities, principally in the small cap space. 
Kuppy is no fool, and is admirably cynical about the world. 
His focus is on events that cause mis-priced securities to be re-evaluated by the market and (hopefully) come closer to their economic value. 
He is good on short squeezes: he called Gamestop ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GME&lt;/span&gt;) correctly a while ago before it exploded, and Dillards.
There are a few stocks mentioned, and helpfully he&amp;#8217;s provided a summary of his own newsletter at the beginning.
I don&amp;#8217;t know enough about all this, but $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;POWW&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBBY&lt;/span&gt; look interesting. The latter has a very large proportion of the float as short interest, and it&amp;#8217;s doing buybacks, which is could be difficult for the short sellers. On the other hand, if the market tanks now the reality of Biden as president becomes apparent, maybe we should stand well&amp;nbsp;back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another event he looks at is spinoffs. Because so much investing is passive now, and the spinoff stock, gifted to the parent stockholders, will have to be sold into the market (assuming it is not in the same index). This creates an initial&amp;nbsp;opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also looks at privatizations, and de-mutualizations, which are what they sound like, but obviously usually create a&amp;nbsp;pop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TAN&lt;/span&gt; is getting&amp;nbsp;tanned&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="0fa87489619f4ecf1251c5db4d31f7b0.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/0fa87489619f4ecf1251c5db4d31f7b0.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parabolic moves have one thing in common, the psychology of masses (and eventually the incompetence of risk management). Bitcoin, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TAN&lt;/span&gt; and Tesla share some of those massive psychological aspects of &amp;#8220;investing&amp;#8221;, where greed and fear (first of missing out up and then down) are primary drivers of&amp;nbsp;prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We saw &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TAN&lt;/span&gt; put in some rather bearish px action last week. Bitcoin has lost the mojo and is &amp;#8220;frustrating&amp;#8221; many longs that were supposed to enjoy the long weekend. Tesla has shown signs of rolling over small, but is still the most extreme of them all. Could Tesla roll over properly going forward, if nothing, just to restart the fear part of the greed and fear&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;narrative&amp;#8221;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; looking&amp;nbsp;toppy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; is a huge consensus long, and people have continued putting money where their mouth is. As BofA notes on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; flow, &amp;#8220;6th largest inflow ($7.0bn) to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; equity&amp;nbsp;ever&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lot of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; logic is built around the weaker for longer dollar, but the dollar has reversed rather violently. Will &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EEM&lt;/span&gt; catch&amp;nbsp;up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EEM&lt;/span&gt; is as we all know full of Asian tech, so it is not really what it used to be. More &amp;#8220;clean&amp;#8221; plays on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; bull is stuff like Brazil, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EWZ&lt;/span&gt;. Note &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EWZ&lt;/span&gt; tanked yesterday, -4.5%, and vol exploded to the upside, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VXEWZ&lt;/span&gt; +12%, closing at highest levels since early&amp;nbsp;Dec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Tech&amp;nbsp;note&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been looking at &lt;a href="https://www.ledger-cli.org/"&gt;ledger-cli&lt;/a&gt;. This has a lot of development behind it, and will be around for the foreseeable future. 
It&amp;#8217;s a useful alternative to gnucash. 
It has an ecosystem of supporting software, such as &lt;a href="https://github.com/egh/ledger-autosync"&gt;ledger autosync&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s not for everyone, but for geeks, it&amp;#8217;s an accounting program which Ken Thompson and Dennis Richie would have approved&amp;nbsp;of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Nobody loves leveraged short ETFs.&amp;nbsp;Yet.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retail sales fell unexpectedly in Dec 2020. Online trade actually slumped a lot: by 5.8%. 
It looks as though getting through the full Biden stimulus measures will be tougher than was at first thought.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NRA&lt;/span&gt; declared&amp;nbsp;bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cnn-correction-ted-lieu-grabbed-probar-not-crowbar-capitol-siege-2021-1"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNN&lt;/span&gt; issues correction of the week, noting that Rep. Ted Lieu grabbed a ProBar energy bar and not a crowbar&lt;/a&gt;. Well, I thought it was&amp;nbsp;funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably because of the retail sales decline, this was a risk-off (deflationary outlook)&amp;nbsp;day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtually all equity indexes down, incl. Japan, China &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Australia up, but timezone&amp;nbsp;effects?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dollar was up: real intrest rates going up, will drive down inflation, will lift&amp;nbsp;dollar,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commodities mixed. Crude down 2.7%, but gas up 3.3% (surging demand in Japan). Nickel was up a lot&amp;nbsp;(3.5%),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; yields dropped, because of the deflationary implications of a drop in&amp;nbsp;demand.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reflation trade is back&amp;nbsp;on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;crude (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTI&lt;/span&gt;) up 1.2%, to&amp;nbsp;$53.6,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;30 year Treasurys down 0.65%&amp;nbsp;(futures),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;value sectors (energy, real estate, financials, industrials all up, between 3% and&amp;nbsp;0.3%),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;volatility (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt;) up to&amp;nbsp;23.45, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;some RobinHood favourites up insanely &amp;#8212; $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GME&lt;/span&gt; (Gamestop) has&amp;nbsp;doubled,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; going crazy: $39.1K, up&amp;nbsp;8%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curves steepening: 10s 2s up 72bp (on the week: Koyfin doesn&amp;#8217;t show daily&amp;nbsp;moves).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in summary, the rumours that the Fed was going to taper have been quashed. 
It&amp;#8217;s a twitchy market though. My feeling is that the smart money is unloading onto the&amp;nbsp;bagholders.&lt;/p&gt;

I haven&amp;#8217;t read to the end, but it seems to be about defining better what &amp;#8216;value&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;growth&amp;#8217; really mean. He points out that a company that is not capable of growth should not be considered to have &amp;#8216;value.&amp;#8217; He spends a lot of time talking about Buffett and Munger, and points out that it was really Munger who understood that a company could be expensive by Graham and Dodd metrics but could still represent great value. I think this point has been flogged to death by Terry Smith. Of course, if the straightforward accounting ratios fail, then the task of identifying value becomes a whole lot harder, and implies that value style ETFs are going to miss the point. Marks is a thoughtful writer. Marks also points out that credit investing and equity investing require very different mindsets. Investing in corporate debt forces the portfolio manager to think exclusively about what can go wrong, since if everything goes right the valuation is&amp;nbsp;trivial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.freepressjournal.in/analysis/policy-watch-storm-clouds-gather-but-indian-punters-fiddle-merrily"&gt;Indians are not very bullish about their local stockmarket&lt;/a&gt;. Emerging markets are always full of problems, but they are also full of opportunity. It&amp;#8217;s interesting that the weakness of the dollar will become a problem for India, according to this article. [Assuming that the dollar will continue to weaken, which may be a consensus view but is far from&amp;nbsp;certain.]&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Trump and the attack on the&amp;nbsp;Capitol&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gaggle of Trump supporters marched on the Capitol, egged on by Trump, to protest against the result of the election.
Many of them seemed to be actors, maybe hired for the event.
Some people got killed.
Trump got banned from every social network on the planet (virtually).
Parler got closed down by Amazon (because they ran their servers on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;).
I don&amp;#8217;t have a good feeling about this. My view is that Trump is not a cause, he is merely a symptom of the contempt that the in which the proletariat his held by the nomenklatura. 
However, I&amp;#8217;m not here to decide what should happen.
I&amp;#8217;m here to decide what might&amp;nbsp;happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A way of thinking about need, value and&amp;nbsp;prices&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homo Economicus&lt;/em&gt; has an insight into his utility function, and will pay for a product or service up to the point that it provides utility greater than alternative consumption items.
In reality, we spend a lot of our time focussing on what we want to avoid. 
We buy food because we get utility from it, but this is another way to say that we buy food to avoid or avert the pain of feeling hungry.
We buy new clothes items to avoid the embarrassment of wearing last year&amp;#8217;s fashion.
We go with the salesman&amp;#8217;s recommendation because, well he seems a nice guy and we don&amp;#8217;t want him to lose his commission or feel like he thinks badly of us.
We do homework to avoid the opprobrium of our teacher.
We keep vigilant to avoid being eaten by a tiger. Private education gives us hope that our children will not blame us for academic failure.
Working hard reduces the chance that our boss will fire us or give us a bad review and no promotion.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESG&lt;/span&gt; investments make us feel as though we&amp;#8217;re not supporting evil companies.
Green products, such as electric cars make us feel less guilty about destroying the&amp;nbsp;planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this has an implication for marketing. 
By raising anxiety, consumers can be spurred to action quicker. 
This has been done for years by insurance companies but it could be done more&amp;nbsp;widely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess that from a utility surface reasoning point of view, this different way of looking at things doesn&amp;#8217;t make much of a difference. 
It&amp;#8217;s maybe just changing the sense (direction) of the vertical axis. 
But humans have have definitely evolved to find pain avoidance more important than pleasure maximization. 
We just know that if a loss is sufficiently large, it might be the end.
Whereas an equivalent gain does not give us an extra life.
The static equilibrium analysis misses the time dimension. 
If we seek to maximize utility integrated over time, extending the upper limit on the time axis makes a lot of difference,
even if the rate of utility consumption in this interval is modest, compared with earlier in life.
Certainly, as individuals and as a society, we choose to exchange vast resources in exchange for a few extra years of&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Disco Time</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/disco-time.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-01-09T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:50+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-01-09:/disco-time.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;

I don&amp;#8217;t recall where, but I&amp;#8217;ve read negative things about WANdisco (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAND&lt;/span&gt;.L). 
One problem is that it seems to offer a one-off service for firms that want to migrate their data to the cloud.
Once this is done, presumably WANdisco is finished (and receives no more income). 
Also, Microsoft and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt; seem to offer their own competing products. These may not be as good as WANdisco&amp;#8217;s not, but with the sort of resources they command can it be long before they are competitive. And, without a referral from the cloud provider, how is the customer ever going to know about&amp;nbsp;WANdisco?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the article says, they are a natural acquisition candidate, both for the big cloud data providers and for Snowflake.
It&amp;#8217;s an interesting business area&amp;nbsp;though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, a relief rally because the Trump supporter riot seems to have been closed down and Pence is going to swear in&amp;nbsp;Biden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Random&amp;nbsp;thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some technology, like nuclear power, has attracted funding for generations, without ever becoming truly economic (if you include decommissioning and spent fuel processing costs), because it&amp;#8217;s something that governments get used to spending money on. Other technology, like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LED&lt;/span&gt; lighting, and maybe most modern screens, just get better and better, without any subsidy. But the first technology is very lucrative, for a select group of suppliers whereas the latter produces no returns above the cost of&amp;nbsp;capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My concern is that green energy production, whether carbon capture and storage, offshore wind farms, solar &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PV&lt;/span&gt;, lithium batteries, will ever move from the first category into the second. Clearly, these technologies are far from &lt;em&gt;hopeless&lt;/em&gt; but I am far from convinced that they will ever make the sort of progress that has characterized the second&amp;nbsp;group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medicine seems to have examples from both groups, except the economics of pharmaceuticals is different. 
Unlike commodities, prices are not set by an auction market. 
For someone who is offered an expensive, unreliable but plausible life-saving treatment all alternative uses of resources are less attractive, almost irrespective of how unlikely the treatment is likely to be a&amp;nbsp;success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more prices are set &amp;#8216;administratively.&amp;#8217; Economics text books describe a world in which there is a supply schedule and a demand schedule for all sorts of heterogeneous markets. Keynes argued that give or take an adjustment factor to allow for different abilities of different men, the labour supply could be treated like the corn supply. When people like Elon Musk &amp;#8216;earn&amp;#8217; billions of dollars a week, it&amp;#8217;s hard to understand how that any model in which Keynes&amp;#8217; simplifying assumption can lead to an improved understanding of how the economy&amp;nbsp;behaves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not an economist, but I did model real world things for a long time. I often made heroic assumptions, to obtain a model that assisted in thinking about the world, but this seems in a different&amp;nbsp;league.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Bitcoin mania</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/bitcoin-mania.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-01-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:50+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-01-06:/bitcoin-mania.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="{attach}f23983ff51c1d5e62965e4d3180cc510.png" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/f23983ff51c1d5e62965e4d3180cc510.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is on a tear. 
It is the ultimate momentum stock. 
It has no intrinsic value, beyond what people are, rationally or irrationally, prepared to pay for it.
Soros&amp;#8217;s theory of reflexivity describes this phenomenon perfectly.
The price has gone up, so lots of people are aware of it as an asset that people want to own.
Most people are not like &lt;em&gt;homo economicus&lt;/em&gt;. They do not have an internal value they attribute to all items they can consume. They judge value by looking at price. 
For an economist, price and value are two totally different concepts: one is what you have to pay, the other is what you get. 
For a man dying of thirst, a glass of water may be worth his life savings. The value is huge, because of what he gets: relief from life-threatening thirst. The price has nothing to do with what the water cost to collect.
For most people, a Porsche is worth more than a Skoda because &amp;#8216;everyone knows&amp;#8217; that people pay more to own a Porsche. 
There is no internal calculation of utility, that is gained by the ownership of the Porsche vs the utility that is gained by putting the resources needed to buy it to some alternative&amp;nbsp;use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s the same with Bitcoin. People pay $30K for one bitcoin because others are willing to. 
There is liquidity, in theory, that a Bitcoin can be sold for something close to this price.
And there is some latent utility that makes the crypto currency worth as much, even though there are thousands of other crypto currencies with superficially similar, or superior,&amp;nbsp;attributes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is an outstanding example, because it&amp;#8217;s so clear that the valuation is not based on some spurious rationale of escalating earnings, unbeatable competitive advantage that are wheeled out by analysts to justify their price targets for $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; or others. 
Nerdy analysts are probably uncomfortable about this, because there is nothing external to anchor the price to. 
It becomes purely a function of fashion and psychology. 
There is no basis for knowing when, if ever, &amp;#8216;fundamentals&amp;#8217; will become relevant once more.
It&amp;#8217;s normally after a market crash.
It&amp;#8217;s no surprise that Graham and Dodd got attention after the 1929 crash and its aftermath, when animal spirits were low and investors proceeded very cautiously and only when they were confident they would get a real return on their&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;REITs&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If inflation is going to take off, real estate should be a good investment.
Buying an office block is a bit expensive, and doesn&amp;#8217;t do much for diversification of assets.
Buying a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;REIT&lt;/span&gt; in theory offers the benefits of the exposure without the costs of illiquidity and concentration. 
However, REITs come in many shapes and sizes. 
&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/checkout?service_id=mp_1060"&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;REIT&lt;/span&gt; Forum&lt;/a&gt; has a mass of useful data.
I have always felt that Sam Zell knows a thing or two, and anything controlled by him is likely to survive any&amp;nbsp;downturn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;2021 Stock&amp;nbsp;Plays&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked up this list from somewhere, can&amp;#8217;t remember where now. I&amp;#8217;ll be interesting to see how these&amp;nbsp;perform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vaccine play - $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VXRT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virus cure play - $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CYDY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Telehealth play - $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOCRF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solar play - $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FSLR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solar / &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EV&lt;/span&gt; play - $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VVPR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marijuana play - $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CBDD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5G play - $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;INSG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt; play - $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AITX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Augmented reality play - $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEXCF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consumer play - $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CWH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cyber play - $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VISM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rare Earths play - $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what these stocks are, and I certainly don&amp;#8217;t have any positions in any of&amp;nbsp;them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News: 
- Trump supporting rioters break into the Capitol,
- Pence refuses to overturn Biden&amp;#8217;s election,
- Bitcoin price exceeds $36K,
- &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GA&lt;/span&gt; election polls suggest at least one Dem&amp;nbsp;gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;energy and small caps continue to gain. Rotation out of&amp;nbsp;tech,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nearly all global equities up, except &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IBEX&lt;/span&gt; (my&amp;nbsp;pick!),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;slightly bizarre combination of gold miners, comms, software, and real estate all down, remaining sectors&amp;nbsp;up,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;momentum, growth and IPOs all (as indexes)&amp;nbsp;down,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mexico wins the country equity market&amp;nbsp;race,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;German Bund yields are down. Apart from a few Eurozone countries in its orbit, all other yields up. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GB&lt;/span&gt; broadly&amp;nbsp;flat,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Euro up vs &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;commodities strong, except gold &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;co,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;credit&amp;nbsp;flat,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;curves&amp;nbsp;steepening,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAT&lt;/span&gt; (Caterpillar) is up 5.6% on very high&amp;nbsp;volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My takeaway: political changes in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; may result in a pivot towards a more value oriented equity market, which is consistent with stirring inflation (value is shorter duration than growth). One swallow doesn&amp;#8217;t make a summer, and one day of moves does not make a trend, but everyone is talking about inflation. The lack of a reaction in the gold price is a mystery, but it may be that all the gold bugs have pivoted to bitcoin. Maybe 2021 after all will see strong growth, with the chairman of the Fed enthusiastically refilling the punch&amp;nbsp;bowl. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Georgia on my mind</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/georgia-on-my-mind.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-01-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:50+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-01-05:/georgia-on-my-mind.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="New Yorker Cartoon" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/c286111e5a1a571d6da0c9c700fb8738.png"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Senate runoff elections in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GA&lt;/span&gt; will determine whether or not  Biden&amp;#8217;s progressive policies will be blocked by Mitch McConnell, the Nosferatu of the Senate. If the Democrats manage to take both seats from the incumbents, we&amp;#8217;re much more likely to see progressive, fiscally relaxed, policy being passed into law, and with it a much increased chance of&amp;nbsp;inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was solidly risk&amp;nbsp;on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;equities up, with the exception of a few &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;markets,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all equity sectors up, especially&amp;nbsp;energy,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;value and small cap outperforming&amp;nbsp;growth,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Canadian and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; longer dated yields up&amp;nbsp;significantly,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nearly all IPOs are above their issue price (a notable exception is Casper Sleep: a mattress&amp;nbsp;seller),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; looking weak again, especially against commodity currencies &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AUD&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAD&lt;/span&gt; (fairly flat against &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EUR&lt;/span&gt;),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The vast majority of major currencies now have policy rates of 0.25% or less (policy rate: e.g. Fed Funds, discount rate etc., I know these are variously&amp;nbsp;implemented),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;virtually all commodities are up. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt; is up&amp;nbsp;6.5%!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all govt. bonds are down, yields up. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TLT&lt;/span&gt; (20yr + &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt;) is down 0.84% this month&amp;nbsp;alone,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, the Conservative govt. has always maintained the position that, in one of the few memorable words of Mrs May, &amp;#8220;There is no magic money tree.&amp;#8221; 
The truth is, of course, that there is. And its fruit has been abundant, easily enough to cover the cost of shutting down the economy, without any signs of a sterling crisis or material impact on gilt yields. 
Young people want money, to pay for their education (especially &amp;#8216;Uni&amp;#8217;), free stuff, like healthcare, and carbon emission reduction. Politicians want their votes, and now that both they and the voters have realized that you can have the penny and the bun, they want the voters to have more&amp;nbsp;buns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actions have consequences. Fortunately, in politics these come with (usually) long and variable lags. The Covid crisis has demonstrated that the government can enable major shifts in behaviour, not just temporarily, but almost permanently. 
Banning air travel, stopping people driving their cars, making them work remotely using technology, are now things. Things that the population can be made to do, and made to continue doing. No longer will Permanent Secretaries be able to argue that any attempt to make large-scale changes to individual behaviour to fix the climate would be nice but in a free country like the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; would be simply impossible to&amp;nbsp;enforce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the conservative instincts of the Conservatives will prevent this getting too out of control, but as the principle is conceded, the pressure to do more will spiral upwards, until either all their inhibitions are cast aside, or they are replace by a Labour administration with&amp;nbsp;none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I certainly hope so, if only to know what the out turn will&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="inflation"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>The markets open</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/the-markets-open.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-01-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T18:38:50+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2021-01-04:/the-markets-open.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/"&gt;Alex Manzara&lt;/a&gt; has produced &lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/banquets/"&gt;a wonderful 1st post of 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Read it and savour it.&amp;nbsp;Summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;M2 in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; is exploding. There will be&amp;nbsp;consequences,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gold, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBG&lt;/span&gt; Agricultural Index (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BCOMAG&lt;/span&gt;) is up 15% on the year, 40% up on the&amp;nbsp;lows,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Base metals are up 50% on their&amp;nbsp;lows,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commodities still are cheap compared with&amp;nbsp;equities,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Fed actually has three mandates: the (badly) hidden one is financial stability. &lt;a href="https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2017/eb_17-06"&gt;They don&amp;#8217;t really try to hide it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jack Ma is now an outlaw, on the run from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CCP&lt;/span&gt; (well, missing, anyhow). $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BABA&lt;/span&gt; probably went&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; vs. China is going to become military, and spending is going&amp;nbsp;up,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; made a mistake by signing a trade deal with&amp;nbsp;China,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;governments are going to continue to bribe voters with their own&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailyripblog.com/2021/01/02/stocktwits-top-25-week-52/"&gt;Stocktwits&lt;/a&gt; weekly wrap notes that $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FCX&lt;/span&gt;, Freeport McMoRan is going up steeply. Freeport is a big copper&amp;nbsp;miner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FCA&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSA&lt;/span&gt; merge to form Stellantis. Experts have been predicting a consolidation of the global auto manufacturing industry. Maybe this is the modest slide that turns into a global avalanche.&amp;nbsp;a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most global equity markets down, but&amp;nbsp;modestly,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Energy holding up well. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OPEC&lt;/span&gt; meeting today: presumably hopes of holding the&amp;nbsp;line,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yield curves relatively&amp;nbsp;unchanged,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Govt. bond yields down in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; core, up almost everywhere&amp;nbsp;else,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corp. yields all creeping up, virtually&amp;nbsp;globally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; down a bit vs. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EUR&lt;/span&gt; but only by&amp;nbsp;22bp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General tone: risk&amp;nbsp;off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks getting interest: $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMAC&lt;/span&gt; (Playboy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPAC&lt;/span&gt;), $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; (up, with most tech stocks down). 
Worries about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GA&lt;/span&gt; runoff election. $400M spent on campaigns for 2 senators.&amp;nbsp;Ugly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess for tomorrow: $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; will crash.

&lt;li&gt;This recession has insane levels of job losses:

&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not only &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; money supply which is exploding: &lt;div class="embed-container"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=zqFg&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/js/embed.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;div class="embed-container"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=zqFg&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/js/embed.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;To devolve or to not&amp;nbsp;devolve&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently read &amp;#8216;The Conscience of a Conservative&amp;#8217; by Barry Goldwater. He was the candidate that made it possible for Reagan to win about twenty years later. The book argues passionately to give power to the individual states of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;, because the constitution says that any power that is not explicitly granted to the Federal Govt. is to be retained by the state (assuming that it is given up by the individual at all). This protects diversity and also protects minorities from being oppressed by a (narrow) national majority. It allows individuals the option of moving state, as a modest antidote to a bad state government. Goldwater argued that once, e.g. education becomes regulated by the Federal govt. it ends up funding it and providing a stifling blanket of mediocrity over the whole&amp;nbsp;country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was listening to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; Podcast, where Warren Mosler was talking about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; (what else?). In it, he happened to talk about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AOC&lt;/span&gt;, and her hostility to Amazon and her campaign against it which coincided with it&amp;#8217;s contemplation of starting a second national headquarters in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NY&lt;/span&gt; State. In this he made the argument that states should not be allowed to set their own levels of taxation and spending, because this would result in a &amp;#8216;race to the bottom,&amp;#8217; as large corporations like Amazon played off states against each other in order to get a better tax deal. He was very critical of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;, which allows states like Ireland and Luxembourg to be tax havens, of a kind, while enjoying all the benefits of being in a large economic&amp;nbsp;block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a Coasian Libertarian. I recognize the vital role the state fills both in providing public services and in setting a level playing field (and enforcing the rules of the game which is played on that field). These two arguments both have merit. 
I think the key is to mandate transparency of outcomes, but I am not sure even I am convinced by&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I have noticed, in practice, is that Mosler&amp;#8217;s argument holds. A national government finds it hard to tolerate local governments doing their own thing, especially if there is any danger of this thing showing up the top level. 
So, on the grounds of banning the &amp;#8216;postcode lottery&amp;#8217;, all competition is banned and one-size-fits-all rules are applied to all regions. The result is stifling mediocrity, at best, and at worst rules which are very unsuited to peripheral regions.
A classic example is a national minimum wage (cunningly rebranded &amp;#8216;living wage&amp;#8217; in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, even though it&amp;#8217;s a hourly minimum and if you only work part time it probably isn&amp;#8217;t enough to live on). This is probably fine in London, but catastrophic in Merthyr&amp;nbsp;Tyfil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, power floats upward, concentrates in the hands of national governments and corrupts them completely,&amp;nbsp;eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

Solid state batteries cannot be rolled, so they stack better.
I&amp;#8217;m not completely convinced, but $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;QS&lt;/span&gt; should not be shorted (in spite of just having dropped by&amp;nbsp;~15%!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banx nails it: (from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Central Bank Digital&amp;nbsp;Currency&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a google alert for the title of this section. I get half a dozen hits ever day.
&lt;a href="https://www.paymentsjournal.com/japan-doesnt-want-to-be-late-with-a-digital-currency/"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is a representative recent one but there are literally hundreds.
Central banks are simply banks which account holders restricted to commercial banks and governments.
Once they get a digital currency, there will be nothing preventing large corps having accounts,
and in due course individuals. This will really tighten the link between money supply and&amp;nbsp;inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Most amazing frauds of&amp;nbsp;2020&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the ones that came to light. I am confident that some more will emerge in&amp;nbsp;2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wirecard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wirecard ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WDI&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DE&lt;/span&gt;), for so long a rising, high-tech star of the German stock market was shown to be a fraud.
Not only was it amazing to see a top member of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DAX&lt;/span&gt; exposed as a huge fraud (and see its stock price crash from €145 to €0.31 in a matter of days) but to see the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;, which had basically been saying that it was a fraud for years, proved right.
The story is fascinating, but the thing that particularly sticks in my mind are the attempts by the German equivalent of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEC&lt;/span&gt; try to arrest the journalists trying to expose the fraud, rather than the crooks perpetrating&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ant&amp;nbsp;Group&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Ma flew close to the sun (king), Xi, and fell to earth. This one will run and&amp;nbsp;run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the real whale is Tether, a supposed stable coin, but not really backed by anything. 
I have followed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XRP&lt;/span&gt; for many, many years (even mined a bit).
It seems very clever: maybe too good to be true.
The artfully contrived distinction betwee &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XRP&lt;/span&gt; and Ripple always confused&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; is already here, it&amp;#8217;s just not evenly&amp;nbsp;distributed&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Long: $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEAC&lt;/span&gt; (SeaChange), $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IAC&lt;/span&gt; (Interactive Corp), $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ANGI&lt;/span&gt; (Angies List), $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WIX&lt;/span&gt; (Wix), $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IDN&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Intellicheck),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short: $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;QS&lt;/span&gt; (QuantumScape), $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PEN&lt;/span&gt; (Penumbra), $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BLNK&lt;/span&gt; (Blink Charging), $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BYND&lt;/span&gt; (Beyond Meat), $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NKLA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Nikola).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never heard of most of any of the longs. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;QS&lt;/span&gt; is mentioned above, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PEN&lt;/span&gt; is surely heading to zero, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BLNK&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BYND&lt;/span&gt; don&amp;#8217;t have any material competitive advantage that I am aware of, and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NKLA&lt;/span&gt; has been exposed as a&amp;nbsp;fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the market turns, the shorts might be worth checking out more carefully. The longs: not so sure. Intellicheck does instant verification of photo &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt;. Sounds great, but I am not sure they are the only ones doing&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why we need more young people in&amp;nbsp;charge&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans (and other species) evolved memory as a strategy for avoiding danger.
Our ancestors who remembered nearly being eaten by a saber toothed tiger when going down to the water hole in the evening were the ones who survived long enough to reproduce.
That&amp;#8217;s why our memory of negative emotions (shame, humiliation, danger) is so much stronger than that of positive ones.
The net result is that our aged leaders become afraid of their own shadown, and refuse to try anything new or remotely risky.
It&amp;#8217;s illogical, because as we age we have less life left to lose. But it&amp;#8217;s how we&amp;#8217;re programmed.
Younger leaders would also put more resources into childcare, education and sports, and less into the health service and other services for the aged and sick. (My favourite statistic: we spend 80% of the whole &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; budget on patients who will be dead within 24&amp;nbsp;months.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>2020 goes out with a whimper</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/2020-goes-out-with-a-whimper.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-12-31T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-08-15T16:57:02+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-12-31:/2020-goes-out-with-a-whimper.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Money&amp;nbsp;supply&lt;/h1&gt;

The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; has the most expensive healthcare in the world, &lt;em&gt;per capita&lt;/em&gt;, by far. Yet the outcomes are terrible. Coase understood why. For some (maybe many) goods and services, the market mechanism is far from the best way of providing them.

This must be, at least in part, down to the availability of credit. The big national housebuilders (e.g. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DR&lt;/span&gt; Horton, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHI&lt;/span&gt;) have risen 36%. This fits in with timber prices going through the roof (as well as holding it up). The big player here is $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WY&lt;/span&gt;, Weyerhaeuser. There is a mass of detail &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4374843-timber-reits-literally-on-fire"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; but my takeaway is that housing and timber will continue to enjoy positive returns next&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) have had a rough decade. Their governance is often terrible. There is some evidence that this is being sorted out. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt; (Energy Transfer) seems a good choice.

&lt;p&gt;As unemployment rises, the job losses are almost 100% concentrated in that part of the population with the lowest educational attainment. Our rulers might know this, but they do not understand it as someone who left school at 16 with no qualifications does. It&amp;#8217;s obvious, but it&amp;#8217;s also &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/de643f89-5be8-4344-81ac-78c7026e9bfe"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;junk bonds will falter. They just&amp;nbsp;will.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;M1 money stock is rising at an unprecedented rate. Correspondingly, since the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; is not experiencing any kind of economic growth, velocity is cratering. But the money stock will be difficult to get back into the bottle, and the stimulus checks (any advance on $2,000) are &amp;#8212; surely &amp;#8212; going to trigger some kind of pickup in demand, even if they are spent only by the people who don&amp;#8217;t really need them.

Bonds globally flat.
Commodities: mainly up, following crude. Industrial metals down, gold up.
Dollar down (now &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; standing at 89.63).
Generally risk-on, but&amp;nbsp;muted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drivers: who knows, but probably vaccine hopes.
Japan may have benefited  from a few stories concerning shareholder activism. I think the main one concerned Toshiba, whose management has been destroying shareholder value for a long&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is into the stratosphere. Tesla is up quite a bit. 
These two bits of vapourware show that a good story and sufficiently strong investor sentiment can keep an asset going up for literally years beyond the point where anyone concerned about value has got&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it&amp;#8217;s now twenty years since we were allowed to carry a bottle of shampoo onto a plane which contains more than 100ml. No plane suffered any injury from an attack based on a large container of potentially explosive material, ever. The ban was created in the aftermath of 9/11. It has never been reversed. We will be wearing masks in shops in twenty, maybe thirty&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;

The standout performer was the Nikkei, up 2.66%. 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; house prices have gone up 7.9% over a year to October.
The Nikkei surged 2.7%, possibly itself a consequence of positive news on vaccines.

&lt;li&gt;(Worthington Industries) $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WOR&lt;/span&gt; is a steel play.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Steepening&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="img" src="https://www.chartpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GT2_GT10-long-term.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wonderful chart, from &lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/curve-4th-turn/"&gt;Alex Manzara&lt;/a&gt; got me thinking&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seems a clear trend of steepening established around 27 Aug 2019. In a chart as compressed as the one above, it&amp;#8217;s not clear how much daily noise there is in this trend.
But it seems clear. 
As Manzara points out, normally the steepening comes from a suppression of short term rates (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FF&lt;/span&gt; or &amp;#8216;Federal Funds&amp;#8217; as he refers to it).
The problem this time is that we are already at what used to be thought of as the lower bound for interest rates.
It might be the case that the Fed can force rates negative,
but Powell has spoken out against this, and truthfully nobody thinks it is a good idea.
So the only way for steepening to continue is for inflation to get ignited, which, again as Manzara points out, means that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; goes&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manzara worries that the suppressed Nashville bombing, targetting infrastructure, as well as the Global Winds hack, the Huawei hack, and more and more information coming out about Chinese investment in voting machines manufacturers will trigger things.
The previous cycles got going with the S&amp;amp;L crisis &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Gulf War, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;Y2K&lt;/span&gt; fiasco &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Dot Com bust, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GFC&lt;/span&gt; and now &amp;#8230; maybe a constitutional crisis as Trump throws a temper tantrum. Covid is still with us, and the unwinding of massive fiscal stimulus to survive it might still crash the&amp;nbsp;economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who knows, but it&amp;#8217;s interesting to speculate. Certainly, the dollar has looked flakey of&amp;nbsp;late. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stimulus bill passed.
Hugely risk on for equities.
For everything else, not so much: commodities pretty flat, energy down, metals up, most ag. up.
Bitcoin &amp;#8230; insane. Up 450% since&amp;nbsp;March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;XRP&lt;/span&gt; is no longer tradeable. &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-338"&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEC&lt;/span&gt; has taken action against execs. of Ripple Labs for holding an unregistered securities offering&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;li&gt;All markets crashed, stock markets closed, puts were no offer, the end of the world was&amp;nbsp;nigh,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;April&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTI&lt;/span&gt; futures went to $-40. You literally had to pay anyone to take oil off your&amp;nbsp;hands,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;May&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; (well, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;QQQ&lt;/span&gt;) hit a monthly all time high. The markets were roaring&amp;nbsp;back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;June&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NKLA&lt;/span&gt; shot up  135% before falling back to&amp;nbsp;earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;July&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;August&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; did stock splits. The shares immediately started levitating upwards. 
People wondered about whether RobinHooders fully grasped the concept of share&amp;nbsp;dilution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;September&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiktok&amp;nbsp;exploded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;October&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNAP&lt;/span&gt; and Pinterest jumped higher during this&amp;nbsp;month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;November&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets toyed with all time highs (in the case of the $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DJIA&lt;/span&gt; it made&amp;nbsp;it). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;December&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BABA&lt;/span&gt; was destroyed because Jack Ma complained about how Chinese banks allocate&amp;nbsp;credit,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AirBnB and DoorDash had big pops at their&amp;nbsp;IPOs,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin continued to rocket&amp;nbsp;higher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Overall&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities did better, but still did not shine as much as they might have.
Equity markets are more overbought than they have ever been. &lt;img alt="img" src="https://thefelderreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-11-02-at-10.40.44-AM-1024x741.png"&gt;
There is more margin debt than there has ever been &lt;img alt="img" src="https://thefelderreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-04-at-8.10.48-AM-1024x739.png"&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the stockmarket is at its all-time high as a percentage of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;img alt="img" src="https://thefelderreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screen-Shot-2020-11-02-at-10.02.54-AM-1024x741.png"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(and yes, I know that the stockmarket is very unrepresentative of the economy, but that&amp;#8217;s a whole different&amp;nbsp;issue).&lt;/p&gt;

The world has long been drifting into a perfect storm of financial, political, socioeconomic, and environmental risks, all of which are now growing even more acute.&lt;/em&gt;(Written in April&amp;nbsp;2020),&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Hopping on the bitcoin&amp;nbsp;bandwagon&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBTC&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETHE&lt;/span&gt; are two stocks which invest in bitcoin.
It&amp;#8217;s an insane idea: if anyone wanted to hold bitcoins, why wouldn&amp;#8217;t they just download a wallet and buy some. 
It&amp;#8217;s like buying an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; which just holds dollars, but charges you 5% a year for the privilege. 
But, in this completely crazy world, it makes perfect sense. 
Ordinary people (aka &amp;#8216;bagholders&amp;#8217;) want to get some of this stuff in their 401Ks, PEPs, and other tax-advantaged savings accounts. Even into their pension savings (wtf?).
These things, in spite of employing armies of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; geeks, can&amp;#8217;t actually do the simple thing.
So money flows into these fatuous collective investments.
Well, it could be worse. 
Investors could be putting their savings in to $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;More conspiracies against the Internet-using&amp;nbsp;public&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After discovering that Google pays Apple a large fortune to make it difficult for iPhone users to use any search engine other than theirs (e.g. &lt;a href="https://www.thewrap.com/google-faces-another-antitrust-lawsuit-over-search-engine-manipulation/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), (Who woulda thunk it??) it turns out that Google and Facebook were collaborating to undermine an anti-trust investigation into the online advertising market.
You almost think that the guys in charge of these giga-cap companies, in the same trade, meet together, even for merriment and diversion, and the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise&amp;nbsp;prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BCX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BCX&lt;/span&gt; is a closed ended mutual fund that invests in miners.
It&amp;#8217;s hard for a European to own this, but the performance can probably be replicated with the main&amp;nbsp;constituents:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Pluto-populists are destroying capitalism from&amp;nbsp;within&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is no accident. It is the logical outcome of the political and economic strategy of the “pluto-populist”. Mr Trump is a natural outcome of the strategic goal of the donor class — tax cuts and deregulation. To achieve this end, they have to convince a large proportion of the population to vote against its economic interests by focusing on culture and identity. This strategy has worked and will continue to work: Mr Trump may have gone; Trumpism has not. Not entirely dissimilar patterns can be seen in Brexit Britain. The focus of the university-educated left on their form of identity politics plays into the hands of their rightwing&amp;nbsp;counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Wolf writes &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/47144c85-519a-4e25-9035-c5f8977cf6fd?desktop=true&amp;amp;segmentId=d8d3e364-5197-20eb-17cf-2437841d178a#myft:notification:instant-email:content"&gt;a more interesting article than usual&lt;/a&gt;. 
It&amp;#8217;s about the fact that democracy isn&amp;#8217;t becoming more common as countries get richer, contradicting a popular theory of the seventies.
Part of the problem is that democracies are much more vulnerable than totalitarian regimes to hijacking. Groups with anti-democratic aims simply have more freedom of association in democracies than subversive groups in other types of regime.
I am not really sure what the solution is.
Clearly, many people can be cheaply and easily persuaded to vote against their economic (and personal) best interests. Groups that set out to do this are getting better at it all the&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Trust</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/trust.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-12-22T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-09-15T18:38:44+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-12-22:/trust.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;22 Dec&amp;nbsp;2020&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The progressive and never ending erosion of trust in our fellow&amp;nbsp;men&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans evolved in small extended family groups.
Our brains are wired to get to know around one hundred and fifty individuals, and know them well enough to know whether or not they are trustworthy.
Primitive justice, of being excluded from the group as a consequence of a transgression, was enough to ensure good behaviour.
I&amp;#8217;m sure that life was not a bowl of cherries back then, but it functioned well enough for what was required of what passed for&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8216;society&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now things are different. We can&amp;#8217;t know people we interact with well enough to trust them as we did back then, 
so we use all sorts of institutions, technologies, heuristics and guesswork to substitute for the lack of trust in society.
Here is a very partial&amp;nbsp;list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taskrabbit,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bedrooms,&amp;nbsp;heroin,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lawyers, surveyors, accountants, insurance,&amp;nbsp;indemnities,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;witchhunts,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hitchhiking,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sharing&amp;nbsp;economy,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deliveroo,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon, not corner&amp;nbsp;shop,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;anti-plagiarize&amp;nbsp;software,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;opinion polls,&amp;nbsp;politicians,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="quo"&gt;&amp;#8216;&lt;/span&gt;Bowling&amp;nbsp;Alone&amp;#8217;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trump and opinion&amp;nbsp;polling,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;most people will not answer a call from an &amp;#8216;unknown number&amp;#8217; to their mobile&amp;nbsp;phone,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;segregation in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; is now more than&amp;nbsp;ever,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the price premium for leafy suburban neighbourhoods (with a local good school) is higher than&amp;nbsp;ever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capitalism is, of course, a fantastic mechanism for substituting for trust. 
It has some wonderful properties, not least a sort of virtuous circle, competition between producers naturally leads to good outcomes for consumers.
But it is far from perfect, as we have all learned at an early age, if we have been&amp;nbsp;lucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin, and blockchain are the latest technologies for achieving this feat.
For sure, the idea is delicious. Nobody can fail to be impressed by what Satoshi did.
But I do not think it is the last word, and I do not think that we are ready to give up our paleolithic ways quite&amp;nbsp;yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Internet has decoupled our social lives from our geographical ones, this problem will keep growing.
We will find that we need more and more lawyers and accountants.
This is a sad state of affairs, and one that will make us miserable.
I am sure that lawyers and accountants are good people, but to make a living out of the fact that we don&amp;#8217;t trust each other any longer is a sad state of&amp;nbsp;affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean for the price of fish? I don&amp;#8217;t really know. Maybe brands will continue to be important. Maybe blockchain applications will allow us to disintermediate between producers and consumers and weaken the toll gate between the two, and the economic rents that flow from controlling that gate.
I don&amp;#8217;t really know, but it&amp;#8217;s something that I haven&amp;#8217;t really seen discussed very widely.

&lt;p&gt;Some, unknown, state actor seems to have gained access to the Global Winds source control system and inserted malware in the underlying source code (or, in some other way incorporated its software into the legitimate, and signed, release executables built by Global Winds). 
This is a serious piece of industrial, or national, espionage.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IHAK&lt;/span&gt; is an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; of companies in the anti-hacking space.
It seems reasonable to assume that better software is needed to monitor servers and workstations (not to mention phones) and it seems likely that companies will pay money to specialist firms for the promise of better&amp;nbsp;security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea how any of this works, so I don&amp;#8217;t endorse the underlying stocks in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IHAK&lt;/span&gt;, but the idea of a cybersecurity &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; seems a good&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields down. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; 10s by 1 bp. Pretty unremarkable!
Food strong, metals generally down, except silver, which went up 1.65%.
Big news is a variant Covid virus, causing problems in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;.
Banks positive, because the Fed gave the green light for them to restart buybacks.
The dollar was a big stronger. Up .23% vs &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EUR&lt;/span&gt;.
Curves flattened.
Bitcoin was slightly down.
Commodity currencies were down.
On balance, a bit risk&amp;nbsp;off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest stimulus package, $0.9bln, is due to be voted on today. 
The bill is packed to the gills with pork, and so will probably pass.
It&amp;#8217;s Congress &amp;#8220;giving away&amp;#8221; money, so it&amp;#8217;s bound to be popular. 
The fact that people are being given money they already had it irrelevant.
$600 per person one-time cheque, together with a modest uplift in unemployment benefits is less than was&amp;nbsp;hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess is that markets will revert tomorrow, but who knows in this crazy&amp;nbsp;market?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Young cardinals vote for old&amp;nbsp;popes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not in favour of diversity for its own sake. 
And I get very cross when diversity is defined in terms of a very tiny number of dimensions.
We justify gender and ethnic diversity for the breadth of viewpoint it introduces,
but shouldn&amp;#8217;t we try to broaden the composition of decision-making bodies even more? For example, how about a balance&amp;nbsp;of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the various personality dimensions, openness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, agreeableness and extraversion (note that this would require individuals from all parts of these&amp;nbsp;spectra),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;intelligence and stupidity (contrary to appearances, most successful politicians are not actually&amp;nbsp;stupid),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;parental&amp;nbsp;income,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;age?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politics used to be a continuation of the class war by other means. 
Now, all the leading politicians seem to know each other from&amp;nbsp;university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that politicians, at least senior ones, are almost always fairly old. 
This surely gives them less of a stake in sorting out education than they might&amp;nbsp;have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/all-the-same-trade/"&gt;Alex Manzara points out&lt;/a&gt; that almost every market is extended.
The exception is long dated treasuries.
But all assets seem to be at multi-year highs or lows.
Alex is a rates man, but he comments that oil looks cheap now, relative to copper, which everyone has bought because the future is electric,&amp;nbsp;man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His view&amp;nbsp;is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long-dated rates have room to go&amp;nbsp;higher,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;P/Es look stretched, even if they are supported by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZIRP&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if one market corrects (e.g. the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; wilts), can the others remain&amp;nbsp;unaffected?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;silver is laggard, as is corn and&amp;nbsp;soybeans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this chimes with me, but I doubt if any of it is&amp;nbsp;actionable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Spacmania&lt;/h1&gt;

I&amp;#8217;m a huge believer in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMH&lt;/span&gt;.
It&amp;#8217;s not the &amp;#8216;evidence&amp;#8217; that nearly all asset managers fail to beat the market.
It&amp;#8217;s that if someone had a consistently winning strategy they&amp;#8217;d end up owning the market, and it would stop working.
So, all the talk about models and back testing left me cold. 
It was like reading about the alchemists searching for the technique to turn base metal into gold.
Physics shows this is not possible (except in a nuclear reactor).
But, I can believe that a systematic way to close positions before losses get out of hand would be beneficial.
Predictions are all very well. 
We all know that at some point the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; dollar is going to cease being the world&amp;#8217;s reserve currency of choice.
This knowledge does not confer an edge, because the timing is so uncertain, as is the market reaction to this outcome becoming more imminent.
Anyway, we need to keep an open mind, and this thread points out how one person understands what &amp;#8216;having a system&amp;#8217; actually involves. 
I&amp;#8217;d like to see some examples, but typically enthusiasts for systems won&amp;#8217;t share them, even the ones that have been back tested to&amp;nbsp;destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Ten years of outsize&amp;nbsp;returns&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This  [great summary by Charlie Bilello] is well worth studying.
Over the last decade there has&amp;nbsp;been:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a mind boggling run by&amp;nbsp;Bitcoin,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a stonking run by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a huge outperformance of growth over value&amp;nbsp;styles,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an amazing return on long-dated&amp;nbsp;treasuries,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;awful returns on cash (relative to just about every other&amp;nbsp;asset),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a terrible return to commodities (because of the collapse in the oil price in&amp;nbsp;2014/5).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody knows for sure, but some of these bull markets maybe long in the tooth.
Certainly, bonds have done well for forty years. Maybe next year will be different.
With the dollar taking such a hammering, it would be wise not to bet against any dollar-denominated asset though (or hedge the dollar&amp;nbsp;exposure).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>The Fed, inequality and inflation</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/the-fed-inequality-and-inflation.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-12-17T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-12-17:/the-fed-inequality-and-inflation.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Treasurys (sic) are now, net, being sold by foreigners.

&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin exceeds $20K. Bubbles gonna&amp;nbsp;bubble.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why inflation and the Fed are so toxic&amp;nbsp;politically&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a well worn theme and I won&amp;#8217;t go on about the reasons. 
More and more commentators are pointing out the reality of the situation.
Alex Manzara wrote &lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/central-banks-more-of-the-same/"&gt;an outstanding post in his blog&lt;/a&gt; about this. 
This is the key passage, where he quotes Richard Fisher, himself the Dallas Fed&amp;nbsp;President:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a quote from Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher at that meeting.  Note, this meeting was just prior to Bernanke’s May testimony that kicked off the tantrum.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;“And I would say for the nth time, for the googolplex time, as I’ve argued at this table, I just want to reiterate my mantra: Unless fiscal and regulatory policy incents business to use the cheap and abundant capital we’ve made available, it will not be used to create jobs to the degree that we desire. It will be used to set the stage, but it cannot lift the curtain and act the play.  And it has, I believe, had a wealth effect, but principally for the rich and the quick—the Buffetts, the KKRs, the Carlyles, the Goldman-Sachses, the Powells, maybe the Fishers—those who can borrow money for nothing and drive bonds and stocks and property higher in price, and profit goes to their pocket. But it has not done much, at least it seems to me, looking at the data, to put people back to work to earn a living by the sweat of their&amp;nbsp;brow.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not some disaffected low-level member of &amp;#8220;The Quad.&amp;#8221; This (Fischer) is a fully paid member of the 1%, quoted approvingly&amp;nbsp;by &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taps Coogan points out the idiocy of basing monetary policy on targeting a statistic (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPI&lt;/span&gt;  inflation) which is experienced so differently by different sections of society (as separated by wealth and income). He&amp;#8217;s always worth reading, but &lt;a href="https://thesoundingline.com/why-inflation-targeting-is-a-bad-idea-and-so-many-feel-that-inflation-is-higher-than-cpi/?utm_source=mailpoet&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=new-post-why-inflation-targeting-is-a-bad-idea-and-so-many-feel-that-inflation-is-higher-than-cpi_568"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; is particularly&amp;nbsp;good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coogan points out that the point of choosing 2% as a target is that it makes the Fed&amp;#8217;s job easier. But in fact, it can&amp;#8217;t hit the target (because China is manipulating its currency and suppressing global wage rates) and so it&amp;#8217;s stuck in a vicious circle of fiscal&amp;nbsp;repression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair to the Fed, it is a common misnomer [misapprehension?] that the Fed even argues that 2% inflation is optimal for the economy. Instead, they argue that having inflation in the ballpark of 2% gives them the space to provide negative real rates without having negative nominal interest rates (and likely wage deflation) during recessions. While that is true by definition, to make achieving 2% inflation the objective of monetary policy because 2% inflation makes monetary policy easier creates a self-referential loop. It leads to targeting nonsensical statistical artifacts with limited real-world relevance. It is to confuse inputs with outputs. It is to co-opt the most important price signals and capital allocation mechanisms in a free market towards these&amp;nbsp;ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a huge boost in govt. spending lately: this might, at last fix the system. To be fair to the Fed (and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt; etc.) the failure of governments to create fiscal stimulus makes them as culpable as the central&amp;nbsp;banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial jobless claims hit 885K today, which you might have thought would result in this being a risk-off day.
In fact it wasa practically risk neutral. The single most important number in markets, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; T-note yield, went up slightly (by 1.5bp!) so you might even say that today was risk-on.
The dollar slumped to 89.85 (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt;), and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; rocketed by 6.2% to $22.7K. 
If the dollar continues like this, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; yields must start to go&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="politics"></category><category term="economics"></category></entry><entry><title>year is running out</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/year-is-running-out.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-12-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:42:46+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-12-16:/year-is-running-out.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Flakey&amp;nbsp;stocks&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNOW&lt;/span&gt;, Snowflake, is looking shakey after a meteoric &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IPO&lt;/span&gt;.

$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPCE&lt;/span&gt; took a dive, like its faulty rocket test the other day. My guess is that it has further to&amp;nbsp;go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Nordea&amp;nbsp;Nuggets&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some great ideas from Andreas Steno-Larsen, &lt;a href="https://corporate.nordea.com/article/62057/multi-asset-10-1-tail-trades-of-2021"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
The list is well worth reading, but the themes&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Fed may lose its nerve and tighten. Options on this are practically&amp;nbsp;free,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salmon prices might explode, can be exploited via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAD&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOK&lt;/span&gt; option spread (&amp;#8216;the fishiest trade of&amp;nbsp;all&amp;#8217;),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt; curve spreads are going to be compressed by Lagarde: buy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTP&lt;/span&gt;, sell&amp;nbsp;Bunds,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The consensus on gold might be wrong: real rates may go&amp;nbsp;higher,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEK&lt;/span&gt; might go up. Suggested trade is via an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FRA&lt;/span&gt;. Possible Riksbank rate&amp;nbsp;hike,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; (aka &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNH&lt;/span&gt;) takes a dive: Biden turns out to be not such a China dove after all. I&amp;#8217;ve never got very far with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; myself: it&amp;#8217;s barely convertible, but this is an attractive&amp;nbsp;idea,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy Green: Barclays Euro Green Bond index against Barclays Corp. Bond index. Certainly, govts are throwing money at anything faintly tinged&amp;nbsp;green,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curve steepner: Steno-Larsen recommends 2s10s steepeners for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; and 10s30s for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EUR&lt;/span&gt;. In general, steepeners are conviction trades for&amp;nbsp;me,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boom or bust trade. Currently, the stock market is discounting a boom, but the bond market a bust. They can&amp;#8217;t both be right, but maybe a staddle type trade can be crafted to profit whichever comes to pass. S-L recommends a swaption trade, not accessible to mere&amp;nbsp;mortals,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similar idea re &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EUR&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;: go for a&amp;nbsp;strangle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(another trade involving a knock-in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt; option, which exploits a particular Brexit sequence. Probably brilliant, but definitely reserved for the institutional&amp;nbsp;investor.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt; shot up on a report, not by the company itself, that they&amp;#8217;d sell a lot more phones. Smells like $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; stock pumping, but worked fine. Stock up 5%. Call volumes for $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt; have collapsed, so they need all the stock pumping they can&amp;nbsp;get.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PEN&lt;/span&gt; makes catheters that kill people. It might be a&amp;nbsp;sell.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the Fed Press Conference today.
Lots of Fed haters had their normal reactions. 
The basic moan is that the Fed creates inequality.
I think that&amp;#8217;s basically right, but maybe it&amp;#8217;s an unwanted side effect of monetary policy, which is forced on the Fed as a result of gridlock in Congress &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; the Senate.

&lt;p&gt;As expected, Powell was extremely dovish, which resulted in a risk on reaction from&amp;nbsp;markets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;up,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nearly all global equities&amp;nbsp;up,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Euro up vs &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;govvie slightly yields up (except&amp;nbsp;Germany),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gold, silver &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; miners&amp;nbsp;up,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;energy commodities, foods&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://convexitymaven.com/images/Convexity_Maven_-_2021_Model_Portfolio.pdf"&gt;Harvey Bassman&amp;#8217;s picks&lt;/a&gt; are available for all.
What I like about Harvey is that he sends out an email when he has something to say, 
unlike some folk who feel that they have to say something every day even when nothing has changed and they have had no new insights&amp;nbsp;(!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Harvey&amp;#8217;s picks all revolve around trading to take advantage of the Fed&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a straight bet on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt;, structured via short put and long call (structured to be no net&amp;nbsp;premium),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a four year call on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STOXX50&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy a mREIT. These things trade at a discount to depressed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAV&lt;/span&gt;, and have a nearly 9%&amp;nbsp;yield,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy a muni &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEF&lt;/span&gt; (not available outside &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;, I&amp;nbsp;suspect),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy gold, as&amp;nbsp;insurance,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OTC&lt;/span&gt; 7-year put on the 30 year bond. This is not accessible to non-institutional clients, but is a bet on inflation that, in Harvey&amp;#8217;s view is very likely to pay&amp;nbsp;off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, another seasoned professional who thinks we&amp;#8217;re going to be in for a period of financial repression followed (eventually) by inflation. 
This becoming the consensus view: inflation down the road, but very low and stable rates for the time being.
I sort of follow the logic, but I can&amp;#8217;t help thinking that once the whole market has decided this, the end will be quicker coming than most might&amp;nbsp;think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the idea of buying something that yields 9% (maybe especially buying some call options on it). But credit spreads are bound to rise, eventually, and a long time before govt. bonds&amp;nbsp;break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairly extreme risk off.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; down 0.3% to 90.45.
All &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; sectors green.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; crushed, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; up 1.2%, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IWM&lt;/span&gt; up 2.5%
Crude up 1.3%
Most global equity markets up between 1 and&amp;nbsp;1.5%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Politics&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Biden is confirmed, he&amp;#8217;s disclosing the bribes he used to get the nomination. The first out of the hat is Pete Buttigieg as Transport Secretary. 
Twitter commentators are mocking the guy for his total lack of qualifications for the job, willfully failing to understand that politics is all about rewarding loyalty, and nothing about rewarding competence. 
It&amp;#8217;s not that Biden had a moral duty to choose someone who knows about transport. 
It&amp;#8217;s that if he didn&amp;#8217;t pick off his competition with bribes, he would not have got to where he is now.
The problem is that this is a truth that can never be acknowledged by politicians or those who report on politics, except obliquely. 
Bismark said &amp;#8220;Laws are like sausages. It would be much better if you don&amp;#8217;t look closely at how they come into&amp;nbsp;existence.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Everything is expensive</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/everything-is-expensive.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-12-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-12-14:/everything-is-expensive.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;So, sell everything &amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp;?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Market&amp;nbsp;Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp;Risky!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Market&amp;nbsp;Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the slightly jokey comments above, I think it might be worth looking at $T (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;amp;T) and some of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; banks. 
The banks will benefit from a steepening yield curve.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;amp;T is an old technology stock that probably has some undervalued assets in the form of wayleaves and cables. 
Data is all very well, but you need wires and fibre to move it&amp;nbsp;around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada is interesting. It was in reasonable shape before Covid, and it&amp;#8217;s monetary stimulus has been huge.
It&amp;#8217;s stockmarket is dull energy and grains, but with demand (hopefully) boosted by stimulus, it looks a lot safer than the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt;.
The other thing is that Biden will (surely) be more willing to restart and expand the scope of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAFTA&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific recommendations which have crossed my radar: $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BK&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMM&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;COP&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WFC&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ABBV&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TOT&lt;/span&gt;. Not mine. No research done by me. 
Do your own, but generally might benefit from inflation and&amp;nbsp;rotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After insane pops, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DASH&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ABNB&lt;/span&gt; must be overvalued, but until they start a clear downtrend, they probably should be left&amp;nbsp;alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DIS&lt;/span&gt; has rocketed because it&amp;#8217;s subscriber numbers are already at 73M, after only 12 mos. 
This is fine, but I can&amp;#8217;t see how both $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DIS&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFLX&lt;/span&gt; can be at very high levels, if the thesis is that one will become the Amazon of&amp;nbsp;streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVS&lt;/span&gt; (healthcare, administering vaccines, but may be damaged by&amp;nbsp;BidenCare).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I subscribe to a lot of newsletters.
Every single one nowadays says that we&amp;#8217;re in a bubble, and it&amp;#8217;s going to pop, and the pin will be inflation taking off.
As a natural contrarian, I get very worried when there is such a&amp;nbsp;consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big test will come at the end of the week, when options expire and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; joins the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt;. It is a  top 100 stock, by market weight, and will force selling of all the other 499 stocks in the index, not to mention the one that it is displacing (which nobody cares about now). Tesla is the largest stock ever to be added to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt;, which is likely to cause&amp;nbsp;instability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally a risk off day.
Bonds generally flat (slightly steepening).
Dollar weakish, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EUR&lt;/span&gt; at 1.21. Not sure how much further this can go.
Gold continues weak, now at 1829. 
Agricultural commods up a tiny bit.
Energy stronger, especially that most hated of energy commodities, coal.
Volatility slightly&amp;nbsp;raised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Untouchables&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched an enjoyable film tonight, &amp;#8220;The Untouchables&amp;#8221; with Kevin Costner and Sean Connery.
It was very watchable, and nothing that follows is in any way intended to discourage anyone from watching an enjoyable and well made movie.
My problem is that the story is about as believable as &lt;em&gt;Snow White and the Seven Dwarves&lt;/em&gt;.
The plot is a classic cops vs robbers yarn, with the good, represented by Elliot Ness and his incorruptibles vs  evil, represented by Alphonse Capone, played with deadly menace by Robert de Niro. 
The idea is that Capone has, single-handedly, turned Chicago into a cesspit of depravity, and once Ness has bypassed the corrupted police force, he can arrest Capone, have him tried and send him to prison, returning Chicago to its prelapsarian state of grace.
I think that the grip of Capone and the other gangs weakened when Prohibition was abolished, and the economic rents available to bootleggers were competed away by legitimate sales of alcohol.
Crime exists because it pays. The more it pays, the more crime is committed. It&amp;#8217;s a net pay, because criminals have to pay the price of getting caught. Or, rather, the expected price, which a function of the probability of getting caught.
My guess is that Capone&amp;#8217;s henchmen were pretty quick to realize that they could continue to access the cash flow from his operation, in his absence, and wasted no time in slugging it out to determine who would be the new &lt;em&gt;capo&lt;/em&gt;. 
But Gary Becker&amp;#8217;s theory of criminal behaviour has no place in a Hollywood movie, not least because the merest whiff of it would kill the film stone dead at the box&amp;nbsp;office.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Linda Bradford Raschke’s rules of stock trading</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/linda-bradford-raschkes-rules-of-stock-trading.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-12-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-12-14:/linda-bradford-raschkes-rules-of-stock-trading.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure who this lady is, but her rules are in line with other similar lists.

Again, this is a recipe for momentum trading, as illustrated by rule 26.
I think that this approach, while always having some short-term validity, is valid for much longer terms now, largely because of the advent of passive investing.
Most equity saving now is in tracker funds, and most of the other funds are closet trackers, so nobody is making investment decisions based on actual returns on investment.
At some point, maybe when global savings start to shrink, this is going to create the mother of all bear markets.
There is a theory that this will happen when the baby boomers start to draw down their retirement savings, but given that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; stock market is the destination of a lot of equity savings from the rest of the globe, the end game may be much more distant than we&amp;nbsp;think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan your trades. Trade your&amp;nbsp;plan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep records of your trading&amp;nbsp;results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep a positive attitude, no matter how much you&amp;nbsp;lose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t take the market&amp;nbsp;home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continually set higher trading&amp;nbsp;goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Successful traders buy into bad news and sell into good&amp;nbsp;news.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Successful traders are not afraid to buy high and sell&amp;nbsp;low.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Successful traders have a well-scheduled planned time for studying the&amp;nbsp;markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Successful traders isolate themselves from the opinions of&amp;nbsp;others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continually strive for patience, perseverance, determination, and rational&amp;nbsp;action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit your losses – use&amp;nbsp;stops!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never cancel a stop loss order after you have placed&amp;nbsp;it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place the stop at the time you make your&amp;nbsp;trade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never get into the market because you are anxious because of&amp;nbsp;waiting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid getting in or out of the market too&amp;nbsp;often.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Losses make the trader studious – not profits. Take advantage of every loss to improve your knowledge of market&amp;nbsp;action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most difficult task in speculation is not prediction but self-control. Successful trading is difficult and frustrating. You are the most important element in the equation for&amp;nbsp;success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always discipline yourself by following a pre-determined set of&amp;nbsp;rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember that a bear market will give back in one month what a bull market has taken three months to&amp;nbsp;build.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t ever allow a big winning trade to turn into a loser. Stop yourself out if the market moves against you 20% from your peak profit&amp;nbsp;point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must have a program, you must know your program, and you must follow your&amp;nbsp;program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expect and accept losses gracefully. Those who brood over losses always miss the next opportunity, which more than likely will be&amp;nbsp;profitable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Split your profits right down the middle and never risk more than 50% of them again in the&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The key to successful trading is knowing yourself and your stress&amp;nbsp;point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The difference between winners and losers isn’t so much native ability as it is discipline exercised in avoiding&amp;nbsp;mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In trading as in fencing there are the quick and the&amp;nbsp;dead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speech may be silver but silence is golden. Traders with the golden touch do not talk about their&amp;nbsp;success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dream big dreams and think tall. Very few people set goals too high. A man becomes what he thinks about all day&amp;nbsp;long.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accept failure as a step towards&amp;nbsp;victory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you taken a loss? Forget it quickly. Have you taken a profit? Forget it even quicker! Don’t let ego and greed inhibit clear thinking and hard&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One cannot do anything about yesterday. When one door closes, another door opens. The greater opportunity always lies through the open&amp;nbsp;door.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The deepest secret for the trader is to subordinate his will to the will of the market. The market is truth as it reflects all forces that bear upon it. As long as he recognizes this he is safe. When he ignores this, he is lost and&amp;nbsp;doomed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s much easier to put on a trade than to take it&amp;nbsp;off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a market does not do what you think it should do, get&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beware of large positions that can control your emotions. Don’t be overly aggressive with the market. Treat it gently by allowing your equity to grow steadily rather than in&amp;nbsp;bursts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never add to a losing&amp;nbsp;position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beware of trying to pick tops or&amp;nbsp;bottoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must believe in yourself and your judgment if you expect to make a living at this&amp;nbsp;game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a narrow market there is no sense in trying to anticipate what the next big movement is going to be – up or&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A loss never bothers me after I take it. I forget it overnight. But being wrong and not taking the loss – that is what does the damage to the pocket book and to the&amp;nbsp;soul.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never volunteer advice and never brag of your&amp;nbsp;winnings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Of all speculative blunders, there are few greater than selling what shows a profit and keeping what shows a&amp;nbsp;loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Standing aside is a&amp;nbsp;position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is better to be more interested in the market’s reaction to new information than in the piece of news&amp;nbsp;itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don’t know who you are, the markets are an expensive place to find&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the world of money, which is a world shaped by human behavior, nobody has the foggiest notion of what will happen in the future. Mark that word – Nobody! Thus the successful trader does not base moves on what supposedly will happen but reacts instead to what does&amp;nbsp;happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Except in unusual circumstances, get in the habit of taking your profit too soon. Don’t torment yourself if a trade continues winning without you. Chances are it won’t continue long. If it does, console yourself by thinking of all the times when liquidating early reserved gains that you would have otherwise&amp;nbsp;lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the ship starts to sink, don’t pray –&amp;nbsp;jump!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tyler Bollhorn&amp;#8217;s rules. He runs &lt;a href="https://www.stockscores.com"&gt;www.stockscores.com&lt;/a&gt;.
Lifted from &lt;a href="http://www.tischendorf.com/2009/09/19/30-trading-rules-from-tyler-bollhorn-of-stockscores/"&gt;Tishendorf again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These have a lot of overlap with Gartman&amp;#8217;s. 
The one that is a bit different, is number 26: that the pressure to mean-revert grows as a price moves further from its trend&amp;nbsp;price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buying a weak stock is like betting on a slow horse. It is&amp;nbsp;retarded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stocks are only cheap if they are going higher after you buy&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never trust a person more than the market. People lie, the market does&amp;nbsp;not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Controlling losers is a must; let your winners run out of&amp;nbsp;control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplicity in trading demonstrates wisdom. Complexity is the sign of&amp;nbsp;inexperience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have loyalty to your family, your dog, your team. Have no loyalty to your&amp;nbsp;stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emotional traders want to give the disciplined their&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trends have counter trends to shake the weak hands out of the&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The market is usually efficient and can not be beat. Exploit&amp;nbsp;inefficiencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To beat the market, you must have an&amp;nbsp;edge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being wrong is a necessary part of trading profitably. Admit when you are&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you do what everyone is doing you will be average, so goes the&amp;nbsp;definition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information is only valuable if no one knows about&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower your risk till you sleep like a&amp;nbsp;baby.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is always a reason why stocks go up or down, we usually only learn the reason when it is too&amp;nbsp;late.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trades that make a lot of intellectual sense are likely to be&amp;nbsp;losers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You do not have to be right more than you are wrong to make money in the&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t worry about the trades that you miss, there will always be&amp;nbsp;another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fear is more powerful than greed and so down trends are sharper than up&amp;nbsp;trends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze the people, not the&amp;nbsp;stock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trading is a dictators game; you can not trade by&amp;nbsp;committee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best traders are the ones who do not care about the&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not think you are smarter than the market, you are&amp;nbsp;not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For most traders, profits are short term loans from the&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stock market can not be predicted, we can only play the&amp;nbsp;probabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The farther price is from a linear trend, the more likely it is to&amp;nbsp;correct.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn from your losses, you paid for&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The market is cruel, it gives the test first and the lesson&amp;nbsp;afterward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trading is simple but it is not&amp;nbsp;easy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The easiest time to make money is when there is a&amp;nbsp;trend.&lt;/li&gt;

The rules were compiled by Dennis Gartman, but as the generously admits, he didn&amp;#8217;t come up with them.
My take is that these rules are mainly useful to understand what other traders will be doing, and given that markets spend most of their time well away from prices that remotely relate to fundamentals, it&amp;#8217;s important to understand the rules, even if you are very skeptical about what they have to say about the underlying value of securities. It&amp;#8217;s taken me a long time to understand how the technical and fundamental sides of trading interact. Even though I&amp;#8217;ve known for decades that technical analysis is more about psychology than economics, I&amp;#8217;ve never fully internalized Rule 14&amp;nbsp;below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never, under any circumstance add to a losing position…. ever! Nothing more need be said; to do otherwise will eventually and absolutely lead to&amp;nbsp;ruin!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trade like a mercenary guerrilla. We must fight on the winning side and be willing to change sides readily when one side has gained the upper&amp;nbsp;hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital comes in two varieties: Mental and that which is in your pocket or account. Of the two types of capital, the mental is the more important and expensive of the two. Holding to losing positions costs measurable sums of actual capital, but it costs immeasurable sums of mental&amp;nbsp;capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objective is not to buy low and sell high, but to buy high and to sell higher. We can never know what price is “low.” Nor can we know what price is “high.” Always remember that sugar once fell from $1.25/lb to 2 cent/lb and seemed “cheap” many times along the&amp;nbsp;way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In bull markets we can only be long or neutral, and in bear markets we can only be short or neutral. That may seem self-evident; it is not, and it is a lesson learned too late by far too&amp;nbsp;many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Markets can remain illogical longer than you or I can remain solvent,” according to our good friend, Dr. A. Gary Shilling. Illogic often reigns and markets are enormously inefficient despite what the academics&amp;nbsp;believe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sell markets that show the greatest weakness, and buy those that show the greatest strength. Metaphorically, when bearish, throw your rocks into the wettest paper sack, for they break most readily. In bull markets, we need to ride upon the strongest winds… they shall carry us higher than shall lesser&amp;nbsp;ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to trade the first day of a gap, for gaps usually indicate violent new action. We have come to respect “gaps” in our nearly thirty years of watching markets; when they happen (especially in stocks) they are usually very&amp;nbsp;important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading runs in cycles: some good; most bad. Trade large and aggressively when trading well; trade small and modestly when trading poorly. In “good times,” even errors are profitable; in “bad times” even the most well researched trades go awry. This is the nature of trading; accept&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To trade successfully, think like a fundamentalist; trade like a technician. It is imperative that we understand the fundamentals driving a trade, but also that we understand the market’s technicals. When we do, then, and only then, can we or should we,&amp;nbsp;trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respect “outside reversals” after extended bull or bear runs. Reversal days on the charts signal the final exhaustion of the bullish or bearish forces that drove the market previously. Respect them, and respect even more “weekly” and “monthly,”&amp;nbsp;reversals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep your technical systems simple. Complicated systems breed confusion; simplicity breeds&amp;nbsp;elegance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respect and embrace the very normal 50-62% retracements that take prices back to major trends. If a trade is missed, wait patiently for the market to retrace. Far more often than not, retracements happen… just as we are about to give up hope that they shall&amp;nbsp;not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An understanding of mass psychology is often more important than an understanding of economics. Markets are driven by human beings making human errors and also making super-human&amp;nbsp;insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Establish initial positions on strength in bull markets and on weakness in bear markets. The first “addition” should also be added on strength as the market shows the trend to be working. Henceforth, subsequent additions are to be added on&amp;nbsp;retracements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear markets are more violent than are bull markets and so also are their&amp;nbsp;retracements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be patient with winning trades; be enormously impatient with losing trades. Remember it is quite possible to make large sums trading/investing if we are “right” only 30% of the time, as long as our losses are small and our profits are&amp;nbsp;large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market is the sum total of the wisdom … and the ignorance…of all of those who deal in it; and we dare not argue with the market’s wisdom. If we learn nothing more than this we’ve learned much&amp;nbsp;indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do more of that which is working and less of that which is not: If a market is strong, buy more; if a market is weak, sell more. New highs are to be bought; new lows&amp;nbsp;sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hard trade is the right trade: If it is easy to sell, don’t; and if it is easy to buy, don’t. Do the trade that is hard to do and that which the crowd finds objectionable. Peter Steidlmayer taught us this twenty five years ago and it holds truer now than&amp;nbsp;then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is never one cockroach! This is the “winning” new rule submitted by our friend, Tom&amp;nbsp;Powell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All rules are meant to be broken: The trick is knowing when… and how infrequently this rule may be&amp;nbsp;invoked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these rules seem contradictory: how can one be prompt in closing losing trades and yet accept that a 62% retracement is perfectly normal as part of an established trend? How can one distinguish such a &amp;#8216;retracement&amp;#8217; from a reversal? Obviously, there is no universal rule that can give the answer, and to a large extent, the path of prices really is a random walk. As someone who read and absorbed &amp;#8220;A Random Walk down Wall Street&amp;#8221; a long time ago, it&amp;#8217;s really hard to act on these rules&amp;nbsp;consistently.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Energy finally about to have it’s day in the sun?</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/energy-finally-about-to-have-its-day-in-the-sun.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-12-13T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-12-13:/energy-finally-about-to-have-its-day-in-the-sun.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;hr&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s hard to time this sort of reversal, but it is hard to see this going on for much&amp;nbsp;longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate tweet, someone pointed out that $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; is now worth as much as all the energy sector put together. 
However you look at this, one of them has to be&amp;nbsp;mis-priced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks are down, yields are down, the curve is flattening.
Brexit is claimed to be the reason, but I have no reason to believe it.
Usually, a treasury secretary or a central banker is wheeled out at this point to promise more fiscal or monetary stimulus.
I have no doubt that in today&amp;#8217;s environment, it would work.
Lagarde may be the best choice now, as the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt; seems less hampered by political turmoil than the Fed is, with Biden&amp;#8217;s nominees not yet confirmed, and Trump&amp;#8217;s not yet out of office, but undoubtedly lame&amp;nbsp;ducks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Natural&amp;nbsp;Gas&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural Gas (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt;) is a commodity I have been watching for a long time. 
It&amp;#8217;s both extracted for its own sake, and collected as a byproduct of oil.
The pandemic pushed down production of oil, which I thought would be bullish for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt;.
In fact it wasn&amp;#8217;t. 
Now oil is going up in price, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt; still seems to be going down.
There are lots of factors which affect the price both on the demand side (cold weather) and on the supply side (pipelines and tankers, as well as funding for fracking).
Andrew Hecht, who is monotonously bullish on all commodities, has said &amp;#8220;Trading natural gas can be like riding a psychotic horse through a burning barn.&amp;#8221;
He&amp;#8217;s bullish again (&lt;em&gt;quelle surprise!&lt;/em&gt;) but this time I think he might even be right.
Read his piece &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4394255-ugly-natural-gas-market-leads-to-bullish-reversal"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Not just wrong, but incapable of learning from past&amp;nbsp;errors&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more humble (macro-)economists tend to say that their work should be seen more like history and less like physics. 
This doesn&amp;#8217;t stop them making forecasts though. 
In a &amp;#8220;proper&amp;#8221; science, the failure of a theory to align with a carefully conducted experiment would result in the theory being put on the scrapheap, alongside Phlogiston, Steady State Creation, and Lamarkism. In economics, not so much, as this amazing chart&amp;nbsp;reveals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one economist I know who has been consistently right on this is Dr Lacey Hunt. 
It just seems odd that nobody in the mainstream has questioned how a model can make predictions that are so consistently out of line with observation.
I understand that predicting the next crash in the economy, or the stock market can be difficult, just as it is difficult to say exactly when San Francisco will experience a massive earthquake. But this is forecasting the path of interest rates, which move continuously, and (approximately) continuously and, many people believe, can be controlled by the actions of central&amp;nbsp;banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://thesoundingline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/survey-of-professional-forecasters-on-10-year-treasury-yields.jpg" width=650px /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Brexit, the end&amp;nbsp;game&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was always going to be a trade off, between deferring to European regulation and damaging the economy.
I always assumed that we had some great minds working out how, by improving our existing competitiveness, transparency, efficiency, enforcement, business environment, cost of capital, tax regime &amp;#8230; or something , we were going to plug the hole that leaving Europe would leave in our economy.
It looks as though nobody actually bothered, preferring magical thinking about the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; becoming &amp;#8220;Singapore on Thames&amp;#8221; (while cranking up public spending to 60% of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it hasn&amp;#8217;t worked, and we&amp;#8217;re going to crash out, and suffer. Probably selling the pound is the logical trade, but maybe Goldman &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; co. spotted this a long time ago and its in the price. I hope they didn&amp;#8217;t, and that the pound sinks, because this might just be the best medicine of all for the economy. Parity with the dollar, especially a sinking dollar, could turbocharge our exports and help us shrug off the effects of lockdown. I live in&amp;nbsp;hope. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk neutral. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; is now down about 1% for the week. The calm before the storm (like the last 30 weeks)?
Consistent with risk-off mood, bonds are up and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTI&lt;/span&gt; crude was down, to about $46.5. 
Gold is at $1,843: about flat. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; is creeping up, now at&amp;nbsp;23.4.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="trading"></category><category term="economics"></category></entry><entry><title>Inflation, but only in new economy stock prices</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/inflation-but-only-in-new-economy-stock-prices.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-12-10T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-12-10:/inflation-but-only-in-new-economy-stock-prices.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was too lazy to write anything very structured today, but I thought I&amp;#8217;d make a few notes of what seems to be defining the &lt;em&gt;Zeitgeist&lt;/em&gt; at the&amp;nbsp;moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asian currencies getting some interest.
Increasing clamour for repeal of Section 230 which protects Facebook from libel (defining it as a platform, not a publisher).
We are possibly in a liquidity trap, or in some way in a domain where classical ideas about the relationships between interest rates, investment and saving have broken down.
Bitcoin is getting a lot more attention as a &amp;#8216;real&amp;#8217; asset. 
(I am starting to reconsider my view that it is only one amongst 8000 crypto currencies so should not have a distinguished position: PayPal is starting to allow ordinary users to hold it in their accounts. I gravely overestimated the ability of the average person to install a cryptocurrency wallet on their &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt; and not lose their private keys.)
Tesla has simply powered through all normal valuation barriers. I is as detached from any rational valuation metrics as bitcoin is, but more so. It is dangerously near the point when it can simply buy out all the competition, so it might even be worth it!
Paul Samuelson pointed out that the economy is not the stockmarket, but the two have never been as divergent as in 2020. 2021 should see a recovery in the economy, but by the same logic, it could see a collapse in the&amp;nbsp;stockmarket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many measures to counter the impact of Covid have had a regressive impact on the economy. 
Low wage service sector workers have been forced to be exposed to the virus, while professional staff have saved hours of commuting and been given new PCs by their employers.

Most of these companies will not be around in twenty years.
But this doesn&amp;#8217;t mean to say that anyone can make money shorting them.
I&amp;#8217;m not saying that Slack was a fraud, but it was not likely ever to make money, but shorting it would have been a grave mistake now it&amp;#8217;s been bought out by $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRM&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2010/03/12/a-short-story/"&gt;Kuppy has written about this&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to think that leaving well alone was the best thing to do. 
Now, I&amp;#8217;m not so sure. 
With the relentless money printing that is washing away real liabilities, these over-leveraged insolvent wrecks are likely to rise like a cork from the bottom of the ocean.
I really want to start an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; that invests only in companies with implausibly high accounts receivables, laughably inadequate provisions, insane &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EV&lt;/span&gt; to revenue numbers and massive short interest. In an investing environment awash with free money, these are likely to go&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–Another stimulus proposal, another day of new highs for stocks.  There was some pressure on the front end of the market as three years were auctioned yesterday.  Also a buyer of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EDH1&lt;/span&gt; 9975p for 1 with the contract at 9979.5.  The two year yield edged up slightly, everything further back on the curve drifted lower in yield.  Tens auctioned today.  Volume was again light. There is continued interest in Feb &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TY&lt;/span&gt; puts, with buying yesterday of 134 and 135 strikes in size of 10k, settled 3 and 9 ref 137-26.  The 137p has the most open interest at 79k as long Jan puts are rolled.&lt;br&gt;
–The rent moratorium decreed by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CDC&lt;/span&gt; is set to expire at year’s end with warnings of mass evictions while Congress dithers on providing aid.   From Reuters: “The day after Christmas the extended unemployment benefits that have kept 12 million people and their families afloat are scheduled to expire.  Then, mere days after that cliff on New Year’s Day, a national ban on renter evictions from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CDC&lt;/span&gt; is also set to lapse. Overnight, an unprecedented bill of $70 billion in unpaid back rent and utilities will come due, according to estimates by Moody’s Mark Zandi.”  This, while Door Dash is valued at $38 billion, coincidentally the same size as today’s 10y&amp;nbsp;auction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t believe that just because someone is a billionaire, that he or she has anything particularly worthwhile to say on politics, or art, or science or really anything outside his direct experience.
Even that may be the result of luck, or be more down to luck than he will admit.
Having said all that, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/delving-six-stages-internal-cycle-particular-focus-us-ray-dalio"&gt;this chapter&lt;/a&gt; by Ray Dalio is, I believe, worth a read.
Dalio is one of the 0.001%. He is not a malcontent, writing a screed of bile from his mother&amp;#8217;s basement.
He is definitely not Owen Jones or Polly Toynbee.
But he is very pessimistic about how the current political/economic cycle will pan out.
I wouldn&amp;#8217;t like to try to summarize his thesis in a glib sentence or two, but he certainly compares today&amp;#8217;s western society to that of Ancient Rome as the barbarians were massing at the&amp;nbsp;gate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with any prediction is getting the time right, spotting the catalyst that will shift the world into its new equilibrium.
This pandemic has imposed massive costs on those in society who are least set up to bear them. 
Unless this is remedied, we&amp;#8217;ll continue to see grumbling unrest.
If is remedied, we might see a &amp;#8220;market instability&amp;#8221; and a second Global Financial Crisis. 
Neither option is remotely&amp;nbsp;appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing takeaway: buy&amp;nbsp;gunmakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;People understand unemployment all too&amp;nbsp;well&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah O&amp;#8217;Connor has written &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ac72d19d-c567-4555-a143-96e9ad606b67"&gt;an excellent piece in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  explaining why people are very skeptical when they hear that &amp;#8220;They&amp;#8217;ve never had it so good.&amp;#8221; Well, they are not literally told that, but they are told that unemployment is extremely low by historical standards. Their instinct is that this is simply not true.
The main reason is that non-economists don&amp;#8217;t understand that the homeless drunk is not actually unemployed: because he&amp;#8217;s not actively seeking employment. Nor is the discouraged youth who spends his days playing video games in his&amp;nbsp;bedroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we need a better measure. Politicians have repeatedly changed the definition of unemployment, and the nature of the job market has changed out of all recognition. 
In America in the 1930s nobody on the government&amp;#8217;s payroll was counted as employed. 
With the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; govt. now spending 60% of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;, if we used this figure today we&amp;#8217;d practically all be&amp;nbsp;counted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Friedman and the responsibility of the&amp;nbsp;firm&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://promarket.org/2020/11/17/ebook-milton-friedman-50-years-later/"&gt;It is fifty years since Milton Friedman said that the proper role of the firm was to maximize shareholder returns&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone disagrees now, but Friedman&amp;#8217;s case holds up if firms are in a fully competitive environment where they are all price takers, and where they all take a moral stance not to break the law, and where &amp;#8216;contracts are complete&amp;#8217; or equivalently where they supply well-defined and commodity-like goods and&amp;nbsp;services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedman would have understood all this, and would have been thinking of firms like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Steel and General Motors, not firms like Amazon and Goldman Sachs. We now are in a world where firms can set the rules and exploit loopholes in double taxation agreements and generally act as price setters. 
Competition authorities have largely thrown in the towel. 
I don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;d like to be a badly paid lawyer in the Competition and Markets Authority taking on&amp;nbsp;Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedman&amp;#8217;s original article is &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/13/archives/a-friedman-doctrine-the-social-responsibility-of-business-is-to.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. It is very powerfully argued, much more so than the articles which now, fifty years later seek to dismiss his logic.
Friedman argues that it makes no sense for a company to decide to make contributions to charity.
Of course, a company is really just a contractual arrangement between creditors to share risk in a particular way: it has no ability to make a decision as a legal entity separate from its component parts. 
In theory, a company is a democracy. If a majority of shareholders wish a company to make a contribution to charity, it&amp;#8217;s hard to see why it should not (assuming that its memorandum of association permits it to do so, but this itself is not immutable and subject to change at the will of shareholders). The reality, though, is that decision making is wholly delegated to the directors, who largely transfer it to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt;, in exchange for suitable benefits, the most important of which is&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern theory is that a company rewards all &amp;#8220;stakeholders&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;fairly.&amp;#8221; Rather than all residual income, after paying market prices for all factor inputs, going to shareholders, it is diverted to all the stakeholders: suppliers, employees, community, maybe even bondholders, for all I know. 
This sounds lovely, until one asks on what basis this income is to be split. 
We know that when &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s get to divide up the pie, they pay a minimum to just those they absolutely need to keep them in their job, and pay the rest to themselves. If you doubt me, take a look at Elon Musk, who stands to make over $140 billion via his performance bonus, almost certainly more than the company will ever make in profits. (The company has never made a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GAAP&lt;/span&gt; profit, so it&amp;#8217;s not even possible to give a&amp;nbsp;multiple.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedman wrote &lt;em&gt;That responsibility is to conduct the business in accordance with their desires, which generally will be to make as much money as possible while conforming to the basic rules of the society, both those embodied in law and those embodied in ethical custom.&lt;/em&gt; I some how doubt that he&amp;#8217;d consider a company that committed 154 violations of securities codes, pay $34 billion in fines and settlements would qualify (&lt;a href="https://violationtracker.goodjobsfirst.org/parent/jpmorgan-chase"&gt;guess which!&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason we have so much of this behaviour is that abuses of this kind go unpunished, agencies of enforcement are systematically de-funded and the stockmarket rewards unethical behaviour. Or, as Kuppy says &amp;#8220;fraud &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;alpha.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To say that stakeholder capitalism is the solution to market abuses of established firms is to argue that criminals should be encouraged to go to church more. It&amp;#8217;s probably not a bad idea, but it&amp;#8217;s hopelessly&amp;nbsp;naive.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Another week begins</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/another-week-begins.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-12-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-12-07:/another-week-begins.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Inflation worry&amp;nbsp;watch&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-12-03/five-reasons-to-worry-about-faster-u-s-inflation"&gt;Bloomberg is in on the act&lt;/a&gt;. This argues that because the pandemic pushed down the price level this year, as we normalize the readings are going to look bad next year, even if the real price level isn&amp;#8217;t much changed from where it was expected to be. Other reasons are the familiar ones: Fed tolerance etc.
The other interesting comment is that there will be sectoral shortages: a lot of the restaurant sector workforce will have moved on to better things (well, at least things with more social hours) and they will not come back without a big financial incentive. The job market is not a commodity market: you have to overpay for labour to compensate for job uncertainty (and to reduce the impact of losing someone you&amp;#8217;ve just&amp;nbsp;trained).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Stocks to&amp;nbsp;watch&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of talking up of own books on Seeking Alpha. There is a thesis that says that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; will see a surge in infrastructure spending next year.
A good company to take advantage of this would be Granite Construction ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GVA&lt;/span&gt;). You can read the whole thesis &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4393218-granite-construction-is-positioned-for-u-s-infrastructure-rebuilding"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has done well, but so has almost every other stock in the index, so maybe now is not the right time.
The whole sector is probably worth looking at more closely.
The infrastructure in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; seems very good compared to what we have to put up with,
but better roads do translate into more votes, especially from marginal voters who think the Democrats are going to force them to give up their F-150s and start driving Tesla Model&amp;nbsp;3s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Pandemic Protection&amp;nbsp;Insurance&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2020/12/04/what-restaurants-and-maps-can-tell-us-about-billions-of-dollars-of-covid-19-relief-funds/"&gt;This article from Bellingcat&lt;/a&gt; gets a lot of data. The conclusion seems to be that the wrong people got furlough cash.  Wrong, in the sense of people who the politicians hoped wouldn&amp;#8217;t get the lions share of it.
I&amp;#8217;m not sure there is anything to worry about, but clearly very poor people tend to work outside of the formal economy, and so are going to miss out on any taxpayer-funded&amp;nbsp;handouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Market&amp;nbsp;crumbs&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cVJyuIshNj"&gt;It&amp;#8217;s official&lt;/a&gt;. The rally in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; stocks this year has been the greatest of all time. Meanwhile, deaths from Covid-19 &lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cPbeuLoGAl"&gt;are also hitting an all-time high&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury is sitting on ~$1.75 trillion of cash (held at the Fed), because Congress won&amp;#8217;t (or isn&amp;#8217;t able) to approve the budget&amp;nbsp;bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, the bill will get approved, and all these reserves will end up in private bank accounts.
Unles the velocity of money totally craters, this is going to see a pickup in economic activity and with it accounts. Read more &lt;a href="https://thesoundingline.com/trillion-dollar-liquidity-wave-about-to-hit/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairly risk off, although the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; went up.
Commodities doing well, including precious metals.
Nat. gas continuing to fade. It has been on a downward trend since 2014. 
At some point it&amp;#8217;s going to pick up the momentum of oil, which is now solidly positive.
The dollar was strong today. Part of the explanation was the pound, which was weak, as it seems increasingly likely that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; will leave the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; on even worse terms than&amp;nbsp;envisaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Carbon credits and international&amp;nbsp;cooperation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems as though burning fossil fuels is a real problem for the world. 
It is far from clear that it is even in the top ten problems, but this does not mean that we should not try to solve it.
Carbon burning creates negative externalities, so the usual (&amp;#8220;Pigouvian&amp;#8221;) solution is to tax it, and use the proceeds to nullify the harm done. An example would be to use taxes on sugar to fund diabetes treatment&amp;nbsp;centres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CO2&lt;/span&gt;, though, is that it&amp;#8217;s a global problem. Having a high tax in one country simply outsources the production of it to another country where the tax is lower. 
It&amp;#8217;s really, however, totally impractical to impose the same cash tax on a tonne &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CO2&lt;/span&gt; emissions globally.
Such a move would plunge poor but developing countries into catastrophic fuel poverty.
The solution, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/96782e84-2028-11ea-b8a1-584213ee7b2b"&gt;as explained by Raghuram Rajan&lt;/a&gt;, is to allocate a single, global allowance of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CO2&lt;/span&gt; emissions &lt;em&gt;per capita&lt;/em&gt;. Depending on how much higher or lower a country ranks on this measure it agrees to transfer funds out of or into the country. The exact level of this clearing allowance would be determined by the distribution of consumption, the transfer price per tonne, and the response to the&amp;nbsp;incentive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individual countries would decide for themselves how to pay for this international transfer payment. 
I am sure I&amp;#8217;ve missed some vital wrinkle, but the point is to arrive at a mathematical solution to the problem, rather than have climate change summits, and agree some far-off goal of reducing global temperatures. 
This sort of approach secures great press for the country leaders, but really does very little to reduce &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CO2&lt;/span&gt; in the atmosphere. 
Even shutting down a huge part of the global economy has not materially reduced &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CO2&lt;/span&gt; emissions.
Just imagine what would be needed really to move the needle! However, it we must move it, we should go for some objective, simple rule-based&amp;nbsp;approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I&amp;#8217;m being politically naive. Even the Taylor Rule has never been actually put into practice. But until we look at these approaches seriously, we&amp;#8217;re going to have the same ineffectual policy making that has plagued the West for the last forty&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Leisure, not jobs.

The argument is well rehearsed.
The fallacy is to assume that all jobs are equally productive. They are not.
The sole purpose of economic activity is to consume, and the market is the perfect mechanism to allocate resources to maximize the utility of consumption.
Sadly, the Conservative Party long ago lost sight of this&amp;nbsp;principle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose it is related to the Marxist labour theory of value: that the value of everything is somehow a rollup of the labour used to create it: no work, no&amp;nbsp;value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Inflation&amp;nbsp;again&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just read this &lt;a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/borrowing-and-spending-limits-in-ultra-low-interest-rate-environment-by-raghuram-rajan-2020-11"&gt;great article&lt;/a&gt; by a great economist: Raghuram Rajan. 
It basically says that the fault with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; thinking is that the cost of debt can start to rise well before inflation is a problem.
It happens when real borrowers start to lose faith in the ability of a government to service its debts &lt;em&gt;in real terms&lt;/em&gt; (i.e. using real resources). He notes that whether the central bank buys up all the debt or not, this is still a problem, because eventually banks will demand more and more interest on their excess reserves, which is what they receive in exchange for the treasury bonds they have&amp;nbsp;sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should read the article, but it&amp;#8217;s the simplest exposé of the fallacy of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; that I&amp;#8217;ve seen. As he says, when a theory states that there is such a thing as a free lunch, it should be examined forensically. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; free lunch is that inflation starts to be a problem only when unemployment falls below its natural rate.

Shale is (surely?) not coming back. Libya and Iran may start selling. Who knows what will happen to&amp;nbsp;prices? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My best guess is that demand will be stronger than anticipated, but I&amp;#8217;m not putting money on&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Forget zombies. Here come the&amp;nbsp;vampires!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/zombies-are-amateurs-negative-ebitda-vampires-are-rampage"&gt;This &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZH&lt;/span&gt; article explains that there have been a surge in companies that have negative &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EBITDA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s not only that they don&amp;#8217;t earn enough to pay their debt service costs. It&amp;#8217;s that they don&amp;#8217;t even make enough money to cover their operating costs.
But they are fine, because there is a big queue of &amp;#8220;investors&amp;#8221; who want to provide finance for them, expecting them to be the next $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KODK&lt;/span&gt; or $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RCL&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will end in tears, but not yet, and very possibly not even next year.  Meanwhile, fill your boots with&amp;nbsp;fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Normal disclaimers with respect to links to ZeroHedge&amp;nbsp;apply.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Consensus forecasts for&amp;nbsp;2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not yet the Christmas season, but it&amp;#8217;s the season when sell-side analysts peer into their crystals balls to tell investors what will happen next year. My predictions of these predictions are as&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Fed has our&amp;nbsp;backs,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inflation will rise a bit but not enough to frighten the horses (or spook the bond&amp;nbsp;market),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the dollar will fall, which will goose the&amp;nbsp;stockmarket,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESG&lt;/span&gt; stocks will continue to&amp;nbsp;rally,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;momentum/growth will continue to be the best performing&amp;nbsp;factor,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gold will not break&amp;nbsp;out,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Europe will continue to under-perform, in terms of its stock market and&amp;nbsp;economies,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China&amp;#8217;s economy will grow at&amp;nbsp;6%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bitcoin will&amp;nbsp;collapse,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;credit quality will improve,&amp;nbsp;and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;banks will be&amp;nbsp;fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that most of that will not come to pass. Notice I didn&amp;#8217;t predict any predictions involving hard numbers (or precise timeframes). This is the first rule of making predictions. The exception is China&amp;#8217;s growth rate, for obvious&amp;nbsp;reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I subsequently spotted &lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cEEjx4rTpH"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; which somewhat supports my&amp;nbsp;contention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;My predictions for&amp;nbsp;2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Watch this&amp;nbsp;space.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Non-farms Payroll print was weak. 
Back in the day when I was writing simulations, this would have meant a widening output gap, and so lower long-dated yields, and so a rally of bond prices.
Not any more. Weak economic statistics are just another reason for Wall Street (whoever, or whatever that is) to conclude that longer dated yields are going up. 
Twenty year yields went up by over 8bp today. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, so only 8 hundredths of a percent: 
but that is actually a lot (Koyfin dutifully reports a change of 5.1% &lt;em&gt;of the yield figure&lt;/em&gt; but I&amp;#8217;m not sure what it&amp;#8217;ll do as yields pass through zero, as they may well do in the near future).
For a long time, bad news has pushed stock prices higher, on the expectation of easing, but bonds have remained steady, presumably on some sort of argument that the economy still has spare capacity.
The response today suggests that someone somewhere, who is the marginal buyer or seller, has decided that we don&amp;#8217;t have spare capacity (even though the &amp;#8216;reserve army of labour&amp;#8217; has many, many divisions) and so this will at last result in inflation. The long and variable lag has&amp;nbsp;elapsed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I may well be reading far too much into one day&amp;#8217;s figures. There may be other explanations. 
It might be a function of the trade deficit finally weighing on the dollar, and importing inflation. 
I do not have a working model of the economy, and it seems neither does anyone. 
But it&amp;#8217;s another data point that supports the reflation&amp;nbsp;thesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Kleptopia Mk&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished listening to the Tom Burgis interview on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TC&lt;/span&gt; Podcast. 
It&amp;#8217;s well worth listening to.
Burgis works for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;, so he has to be circumspect, but he came very close to being outspoken about Tony Blair and his dealings in Kazakhstan. 
Dictatorships, and kleptocracy are nothing new. Just read about the presidency of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobutu_Sese_Seko"&gt;Mobutu Sese Seko&lt;/a&gt;. 
But things are different now, because now these dictators are actively aided and abetted by lawyers, accountants and politicians in London, Washington, Paris and really everywhere in the developed world.
The wealth available to siphon out of countries in Africa (and other developing nations) is much larger, and the flows are much larger. We have always sold these places overpriced weapons and aeroplanes they hardly needed. 
Now we have the very much senior ex-politicians fawning over the oligarchs, and pleading them to come to London where their ill-gotten gains and their reputations are laundered. 
We seem hell bent on underfunding and undermining the agencies that could interfere with these flows, from the Serious Fraud Office to Companies House (which continues to make empty gestures to revealing beneficial ownership of front&amp;nbsp;companies). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in so many political issues, this topic never gets to the point where voters are engaged, so it becomes much safer to argue about transgender bathrooms and mask wearing in public. 
At the very least, try to inform yourself. Tom is a good investigative journalist. He wrote &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/80f25f82-5f21-4a56-b2bb-7a48e61dd9c6"&gt;a piece for today&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about how Timur Kulibayev, the son-in-law of the Kazakh president, skimmed off millions from a pipeline project. 
Ask yourself whether it is likely that this scheme could have succeeded without active support of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Kleptocracies&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to (most of) an interview with Tom Burgis of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;. 
I have to admit that although I&amp;#8217;ve read the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; for decades, I&amp;#8217;ve never come across him.
He writes about what kleptocrats do with their money.
It seems that the answer is that they lend it to people like Donald Trump.
Burgis has written before on how Africa has been systematically plundered by dictators who have sold the wealth of their countries to multinationals.
I haven&amp;#8217;t read these books, although they seem to say the same sort of thing as Misha Glenny&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;McMafia&lt;/em&gt; and Bill Browder&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Red Notice&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems obvious that the wealth of the developing world is being plundered, and is leaking out of the countries where it originates into the West.
It also seems obvious that there must be many professionals throughout the world who are assisting in this process for what is probably a modest cut.
Certain cases, such as that of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ENRC&lt;/span&gt;, come to light, which confirm how terrible governance is in these places.
Everyone knows that much of Africa is &amp;#8220;fantastically corrupt&amp;#8221; (in the overheard words of David Cameron).
And yet, officially, we continue to do businesses with these countries, turning a blind eye to the lack of democracy (and the systematic dismantling of the institutions that might get democracy started or&amp;nbsp;restarted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have many anti-bribery laws. It&amp;#8217;s almost impossible to get enough cash out of the bank to buy an old banger.
But Putin has stolen a huge part of the total output of his country and yet our government treats him as the legitimate leader of the country. I get it that they have no real option. But to see the oligarchs slug it out over who owns their ill-gotten gains in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; courts seems somewhat&amp;nbsp;surreal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is that national laws are, well, national. And international laws are weak, because they require a very wide consensus and so run up against the problem that the majority of the countries in the world are run by crooks.
And, of course, in country to country dealmaking, it&amp;#8217;s really a great deal easier to do business with a crook than with a democracy. 
When you deal with a dictator like, for instanced, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MBS&lt;/span&gt;, you get certainty, and a person who is easy to buy off.
Buying off a whole population which votes freely is a whole lot harder.
So, the leader of the free world much prefers a world which is really a lot less free than the country he happens to run.
More than anyone, he understands how maddeningly difficult it is to get support from the electorate. 
I am sure the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CIA&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSA&lt;/span&gt; know perfectly well what is going on, and like the situation very well, as, well, kompromat is the most powerful lever of&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In somewhere like Nigeria, to do any sort of business, it&amp;#8217;s necessary to pay the odd bribe. 
So everyone is complicit, and is guilty, and, if necessary can be arrested and imprisoned. 
At the will of the top guy.
How envious of this must &lt;span class="caps"&gt;POTUS&lt;/span&gt; always&amp;nbsp;be!&lt;/p&gt;

This implies that fiscal spending is not actually&amp;nbsp;constrained. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Inflation&amp;nbsp;again&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened with interest, as usual, to the latest Macro Musings podcast. You can read the transcript &lt;a href="https://www.mercatus.org/bridge/podcasts/11232020/bilal-hafeez-inflation-innovation-and-economic-recovery-after-covid-19"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
Bilal Hafeez was talking about various macroeconomic issues, but the one I found most interesting is&amp;nbsp;inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is basically is very sceptical about the ability of central banks to create inflation. 
You should read the transcript or listen to the podcast to hear the full argument, but a few of his reasons are as&amp;nbsp;follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is no real inter-country correlation between debt levels and&amp;nbsp;inflation,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wage increases seem to have become detached from inflation, and central banks are not really targetting inflation, they&amp;#8217;re targetting labour income, and as long as that keeps going up they will not push too hard to hit their notional inflation&amp;nbsp;targets,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is no real evidence that there really is any likelihood of political unrest, which would lead to a big increase of government spending in the real economy (by subsidizing labour for&amp;nbsp;example),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;developed economies now are principally service economies. The only inflation which is seen in these economies is service inflation (higher education, healthcare, professional services, and housing services). The Covid crisis has  delivered a positive supply shock to all of these sectors: university teaching can be delivered via Zoom, GPs will have consultations and diagnosis via Skype, we&amp;#8217;ll start to use lawyers and accountants based in India via the Internet and everyone will move away from expensive urban centres to remote rural and post-industrial centres where houses are enormously&amp;nbsp;cheaper. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as populations age, demand for most services decline, so the supply shock is&amp;nbsp;amplified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize, we&amp;#8217;re turning Japanese, and Zoom is going to do for services what the container did for manufacturing: outsource it to cheaper&amp;nbsp;places. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know whether he&amp;#8217;s right. If he is, they should take back Milton Friedman&amp;#8217;s Nobel Prize. 
Having said that, he makes some strong points: ones which the crypto-MMTers would be wise to&amp;nbsp;amplify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other point that Hafeez concedes, though, is that the dollar is probably moving down. He talks about the demand for dollar-denominated assets being supported by the actions of the Fed buying Treasuries and other dollar-denominated assets, but I don&amp;#8217;t really understand this: surely this just results in more dollars being in the system. 
We&amp;#8217;ll see: I&amp;#8217;ll have to re-read the piece, because there is a lot to digest in&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today things were pretty much risk neutral, maybe marginally risk on. Bitcoin was up, as usual.
Indices flat.
Gold up a bit, oil up a bit more. Soybeans down.
Energy shares did well.
The dollar (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt;) fell again. It&amp;#8217;s now very close to 91.

&lt;p&gt;The steepener trade caught a bid. 
The ostensible reason is that J Powell made a statement that the Fed would not raise the short end of the curve until they see real evidence of inflation.
All too often the Fed has not waited until it saw the whites of the eyes of its deadly enemy, inflation, and tightened too soon.
The result is that since the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GFC&lt;/span&gt; of 2008 most economies have had monetary policies which have been too tight.
A few voices in the wilderness have been saying this since the beginning (notably Scott Sumner), but most people seem mesmerized by the idea that if nominal rates are below one percent monetary conditions must be loose. 
This totally fails to recognize that real rates have an inflation component (what Lacy Hunt calls the &amp;#8216;Fisher Equation&amp;#8217; but most other economists just seem to think is so obvious as to not warrant a special&amp;nbsp;name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, with Powell being dovish, and (presumably) deciding that the only way he&amp;#8217;ll get to do a second term is to persuade Harris/Biden that he&amp;#8217;ll run a hotter economy than the rest I think the market is waking up to the reality that the long end is going to rip.
Of course, I might just be talking my book.
Or, I might as well say that we&amp;#8217;re all Modern Monetary Theorists now: certainly large sections of the Democratic Party are, including influential ones, like one lead by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AOC&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I leave you with evidence. Note that this is from &lt;a href="https://app.koyfin.com/"&gt; Koyfin&lt;/a&gt;, which has had a makeover and now covers &amp;#8220;international&amp;#8221;  equities and generally is a whole lot better.  Websites like Koyfin, and &lt;a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/"&gt;Trading Economics&lt;/a&gt; really provide a wealth of market and economic&amp;nbsp;data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was cold called by a boiler room operation today. 
A guy was trying to sell me an investment opportunity buying bitcoins.
This is not interesting in itself, except to the extent to which the guys that runs these scams have antennae which are finely tuned into what the unsophisticated investor wants to buy. 
The pitch was along the lines of &amp;#8220;this thing has gone up so much lately, you have to buy, because otherwise you&amp;#8217;re missing out.&amp;#8221; I didn&amp;#8217;t really give the caller a chance to expand the pitch, as there was no way I was going to buy, and I felt it was wasting his time to make him recite it.
But, this surely is a indication that $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; is at a&amp;nbsp;top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Tesla&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk is saying that he&amp;#8217;s open to offers from other companies. He is also saying that he&amp;#8217;s trying to cram down costs.
The stock has reached (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMHO&lt;/span&gt;) unsustainable levels, way beyond what even he thinks is warranted, but at the fag end of a bull market stocks can still go up violently as the last bear capitulates. At some point, there are no more buyers and the short squeeze reverses, but this can take an agonizing time. 
Ben Graham&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Mr Market&amp;#8221; does not predictably swing from irrational buying to irrational selling.
He keeps buying for years longer than anyone things is&amp;nbsp;sane. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;software&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I downloaded a new release of Thunderbird today. If you want a multi-platform classic email client (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MUA&lt;/span&gt; in the jargon), it&amp;#8217;s damn hard to beat. It has built in support for gnupg (equivalently openpgp), which is great.
It seems odd that with Bitcoin proving the security of public key encryption, more people aren&amp;#8217;t turning to it for security and signing. 
I am frequently required to sign contracts, and (for me) the perfect way is to publish my public key (added at the bottom of this post) and then sign using &lt;a href="https://gnupg.org/download/"&gt;gpg&lt;/a&gt;, which is available on all platforms,  but somehow people don&amp;#8217;t use much in practice. 
It really is very slick, and works&amp;nbsp;flawlessly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(In practice I tend to use &lt;a href="https://www.concordnow.com/"&gt;concord&lt;/a&gt;, which is a bit over the top, but is free, and easy to use for&amp;nbsp;non-techies.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should also give an honourable mention to &lt;a href="https://www.zettlr.com/"&gt;Zettlr&lt;/a&gt;. I have been writing all my posts in it for a month or so, and it goes from good to&amp;nbsp;better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d also like to put in a mention of the full node self-hosted wallet for bitcoin: Bitcoin Core.
Once this thing syncs, it uses up negligible &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPU&lt;/span&gt;.  Seriously, you can&amp;#8217;t find it in the process list.
I&amp;#8217;d recommend it. It&amp;#8217;s really very easy to install. (I did try to install the equivalent for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XMR&lt;/span&gt; but gave&amp;nbsp;up.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;all &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; sectors down except tech. and&amp;nbsp;health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; up a bit: going into the Consumer Discretionary sector, along with retailers, car&amp;nbsp;companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Free&amp;nbsp;trade&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trade barriers, originally called customs (now mainly referred to as tariffs) have always been a political issue. 
In Elizabethan times, the Treasury relied on them as the mainstay of their income. 
I think the government also sold monopolies, which is a sort of tax farming, but customs was the main source.
The lords, although they owned all the land, were loathe to give up any of their resources to the king, beyond providing troops and some arms.
I am not a historian, but my understanding was that even the Magna Carta did not alter the tax raising powers of the&amp;nbsp;King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, tariffs are a relatively minor part of tax revenue. They exist to protect certain industries, probably certain firms, and are enthusiastically levied in exchange for political support. Now we are leaving the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;, the politicians see this revenue accruing to themselves, not the Trade Commission in Brussels, so, of course, why would they elect to set tariffs at zero, thereby removing the delays involved in tracking imports and the harm done to the consumer. Consumers don&amp;#8217;t lobby or finance political&amp;nbsp;campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand this, economically literate civil servants, news editor and MPs (presumably) understand this.
But they all keep their heads below the parapet. 
The waffle on about although fishing accounts for about as much &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; as one store (Harrods, admittedly) and is smaller than the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; sewing machine industry, it is actually very, very important for&amp;nbsp;jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politicians now can justify any policy, as long as it creates jobs. They could give their wholehearted support to Crossrail 2, if TfL promised that the tunnel would be dug by men wielding gardening trowels. 
Wind turbines no longer need to actually reduce the amount of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CO2&lt;/span&gt; going into the atmosphere, they just have to create jobs in their various processes of manufacturing and installing. 
So it is with fishing: a new fleet will be worth it if it creates some&amp;nbsp;jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody ever suggests that the labour market can clear itself any more. 
I suppose we all consider it unthinkable that people should be paid their marginal product, or be allowed to keep more than a small proportion of this to consume as they wish.
We need to tell employers what they must pay (at least the lower bound of this), and how little employees can keep. 
And yet they wonder why unemployment is so high, and rising. To the point that next year it might hit 7.7%. 
Even with government spending and transfer payments now hitting sixty or seventy percent of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;, we still will have one in thirteen individuals of working age actively searching for work. The considerable numbers of terminally discouraged, who just conclude that they&amp;#8217;ll never get a job end up being removed from the statistics, by becoming classified as disabled. The proportion of the population which is thus classified will undoubtedly go up over the next few&amp;nbsp;years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with days to go to complete agree a trade deal, you&amp;#8217;d think that this would be a lead story on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt;.
But you&amp;#8217;d be wrong. It&amp;#8217;s Covid all the way. And some schadenfreude about the richly deserved demise of Phillip Green, whose Arcadia group has gone into&amp;nbsp;administration. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="economics"></category></entry><entry><title>Removing statues and cancel culture</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/removing-statues-and-cancel-culture.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-29T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-11-29:/removing-statues-and-cancel-culture.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Thomas&amp;nbsp;Picton&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Picton"&gt;Thomas Picton&lt;/a&gt; is a controversial figure. He fought bravely for his country, for which he&amp;#8217;s remembered in a statue in Cardiff. 
He was also involved in slavery and, at least by modern standards, inhumane behaviour during the time he was governor of Trinidad. A campaign has been waged to remove his statue, at least from its current position on public&amp;nbsp;display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acts today cannot affect what has happened in the past. The injury to the mistreated woman will not be undone. However, the act will signal to people who are alive now and in the future that this behaviour is unacceptable. It is hard to see any comparable act of cruelty today being affected by the decision to remove the statue. 
The law is very clear now, and has been for a long time, that these actions are unacceptable, and I do not think that anyone would argue that &amp;#8216;cancelling&amp;#8217; the statue will change the likelihood of this happening in future.&lt;br&gt;
Arguably, the statue was erected to signal to the population that acts of sacrifice in times of war were virtuous, and this signalling was designed to maximize support for the military, and the exercise of military power by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. 
It has probably served that&amp;nbsp;function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removing the statue will signal an act of contrition towards the victim of the cruelty, and by extension to people who feel oppressed. It is easy to understand why this is seen as a desirable goal, although I am sure that those who are suffering oppression now would much prefer some practical action to reduce that oppression, rather than some expression of regret about past oppression. I am sure if I were hungry, I&amp;#8217;d prefer to have bread than to have&amp;nbsp;pity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The added complication about Picton is that the young woman he was accused of torturing was of mixed race, although in modern parlance &amp;#8220;black.&amp;#8221; The removal of the statue then becomes a collective act apology on the part of white oppressors towards black victims. Politics is much easier when voters vote as a block. Votes can be bought more cheaply. If every voter has to be persuaded by a government promising to make life better for everyone, there are fewer spoils to be shared by the victorious party and its&amp;nbsp;insiders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each successful campaign leads to one which is more divisive, although in terms of merit more marginal. All historical decisions will come to be judged against our modern morals and standards. In a world like this, no historical figure will escape censure. Already, most normal citizens shy away from public service because of the scrutiny of their private lives it entails. If cancel culture continues, public figures will have to be prepared to be judged wanting by not only their contemporaries but by the generations that follow&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to suggest that we should not study history, understand it, and learn from the mistakes which were made then. But to condemn the individuals who made those mistakes, who did not have the benefit of hindsight is a cruel and unusual punishment. Of course, they will not care, but we&amp;nbsp;should.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Black Friday, but Amazon does not sell shares</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/black-friday-but-amazon-does-not-sell-shares.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-11-27:/black-friday-but-amazon-does-not-sell-shares.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the risk on momentum from before the holiday&amp;nbsp;continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Crypto&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned the other day, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; and other crypto currencies are falling back.
It&amp;#8217;s hard to see why a sensible asset manager would want to own such a thing,
but with most millennials and Gen Y folk just thinking that as long as they invest in an index &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; it doesn&amp;#8217;t really matter what sector or asset class or style they choose, we&amp;#8217;re going to get money flowing into bitcoin trusts, such as $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBTC&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s interesting that Monero, the crypto currency of choice, now, on on Dark Net Markets, is not tradeable via Coinbase. 
It&amp;#8217;s available on &lt;a href="https://www.kraken.com/en-gb/"&gt;Kraken&lt;/a&gt; though. 
I am signed up with a few of these coin exchanges, and it&amp;#8217;s now very different to the good old days when you could just register, make a payment and buy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt;. 
It will be interesting to watch the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;XMR&lt;/span&gt; rate. You can see it &lt;a href="https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/9qUpHGr4/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
I wish I knew more about how to get great charts out of trading view, but I don&amp;#8217;t, so you&amp;#8217;ll have to put up with a&amp;nbsp;link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I downloaded the original bitcoin core full node wallet. It runs fine on an eight year old desktop &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt;. 
You can have a play &lt;a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;I am a great admirer of &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0ca06172-bfe9-11de-aed2-00144feab49a"&gt;George Soros&amp;#8217;s reflexivity theory&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;#8217;t claim to fully understand it. Part of it is about our inability to fully understand anything, so this is covered by the theory. 
But the bit of it that I cling to is that how we think about the world influences how the world is.
In investing, as long as everyone believes that a stock price will rise, and is willing to act on that belief, the price will rise, whatever  its P/E ratio is. 
At some level this is just Benjamin Graham&amp;#8217;s observation that the stock market functions like a voting machine. 
I think that Soros&amp;#8217;s theory is deeper than that interesting, but uncontentious observation but I don&amp;#8217;t understand it will enough to explain&amp;nbsp;why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, &lt;a href="https://www.thestreet.com/mishtalk/economics/great-inflation-debate-when-and-how-big"&gt;Jim Bianco&amp;#8217;s guest post&lt;/a&gt; on inflation is an example of this. If people believe inflation is coming, it will. Again, this is probably a rehash of rational expectations theory, or Ricardian equivalence, or plan common sense. But it is convincing to me (you will not be surprised to&amp;nbsp;read).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://imageproxy.themaven.net/https%3A%2F%2Fimages.saymedia-content.com%2F.image%2FMTc3MDE4NzAzODIzNTEyNzE5%2Ffed-funds-futures-forward-curve.png?w=788&amp;q=40&amp;h=556.2352941176471&amp;auto=enhanced&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5&amp;fp-z=1&amp;fp-debug=false"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBTC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuppy has been promoting $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBTC&lt;/span&gt; (Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Company) for a while now, but has only just produced &lt;a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2020/11/24/why-this-reflexive-ponzi-scheme-will-continue/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; on why it&amp;#8217;s such a great asset.
Even though I wrote the paragraph above having not read Kuppy&amp;#8217;s post, he too talks about Soros&amp;#8217;s reflexivity hypothesis. 
Nobody can have failed to notice the rise of Bitcoin lately, and I think that Kuppy gets close to the explanation.
Eventually, there will be benchmarks, and the buy side will simply have to own this crappy stuff, because &amp;#8230; the passive crowd want to own it, without having any idea of how it works and why it even has any value (it doesn&amp;#8217;t, but that doesn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;matter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuppy&amp;#8217;s post goes into some (but incomplete) detail on how to exploit the arbitrage between &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBTC&lt;/span&gt; and bitcoin itself. 
The fact is that you can buy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBTC&lt;/span&gt; at net asset value for cash (or bitcoin) but if you can bear to wait six months, you get to sell something worth 26% more. This arb. can be done if you are &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; resident, but is tricky for foreigners like&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the main takeaway is that people see the price of bitcoin going up, don&amp;#8217;t trust themselves not to lose the key to their wallet, and don&amp;#8217;t want to run their own blockchain&amp;nbsp;wallet, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that Kuppy and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; agree on is that this is all reminiscent of a Ponzi scheme. &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/11904154-195b-4ffc-8781-e46345a67e66?desktop=true&amp;amp;segmentId=d8d3e364-5197-20eb-17cf-2437841d178a#myft:notification:instant-email:content"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was a pretty wild day. Trump has (in effect) conceded, and Biden is busily filling his cabinet with Wall Street nominees. Janet Yellen is appointed as Treasury Secretary, which will ensure that securities will continue to be pumped higher and higher.
Mnuchin has petulantly refused to continue guaranteeing some of the SPVs which allow the Fed to support corporate bonds and similar private securities, but this is at best a short term interruption as (surely) Yellen will re-activate them.
Krugman has described Mnuchin&amp;#8217;s action as an act of economic vandalism, but Krugman has never seen any political action that would lead to more debt that he doesn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was risk on steroids. There wasn&amp;#8217;t an equity market on the planet that didn&amp;#8217;t shoot up.
Unloved sectors like energy and real estate were strongly bid up.
$X (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Steel) went up &lt;em&gt;by 23.5%&lt;/em&gt;.
This is really a crazy market.
Meanwhile in currencies, Turkish Lira is getting hammered again, even against the dollar, which was sinking (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; down 0.37%), but particularly against the Euro.
Gold and gold miners crashed, as it&amp;#8217;s a risk off asset.
Thirty year Treasuries were down 0.45%, with the yield curve (predictably) steepening.
Amazingly, Sept 22 Eurodollar futures options cheapened. The world is indeed convinced that under Yellen and Powell rates are going to zero or&amp;nbsp;lower.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Investing under uncertainty</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/investing-under-uncertainty.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-23T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-11-23:/investing-under-uncertainty.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Another day, another vaccine&amp;nbsp;candidate&lt;/h1&gt;

Who can&amp;nbsp;tell?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Traditional valuation metrics considered&amp;nbsp;outdated&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4390483-hayden-capital-quarterly-letter-q3-2020"&gt;Hayden capital have written a note saying that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DCF&lt;/span&gt; approaches to value are wrongheaded&lt;/a&gt;.
Well, that&amp;#8217;s sort of true, in the short run. 
It&amp;#8217;s true that the radical uncertainty of the real world makes valuing something by mechanically discounting cash flows according to a zero coupon curve is flawed. Using a higher rate as a way of allowing for uncertainty about the future cash flows is even more flawed. 
However, I somehow feel that sacrificing consumption today does require some sort of mechanism to compare the sacrifice against the consumption in the future in a comparable, risk-adjusted,&amp;nbsp;basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Student housing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMBS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s looking&amp;nbsp;sick&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/11/22/taxpayers-face-435-billion-in-student-loan-losses-already-baked-in-department-of-education-study/"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; argues that student housing mortgage backed securities are not a good place to be. 
The whole situation of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; (and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;) student loans seems pretty terrible. 
The problem is that the Fed may be able to inflate the problem away, so it&amp;#8217;s hard to know how to take advantage of the&amp;nbsp;situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another vaccine and risk on knows no bounds.
Unloved sectors like airlines, energy and value all catch a bid.
Precious metals forget all about looming inflation as money flows into income-generating assets.
Agricultural commodities benefit modestly ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DBA&lt;/span&gt; up 0.78%).
Miners are crushed.
Bitcoin retraces a bit.
The Turkish Lira suddenly reverses as investors wonder whether 15% interest rates are politically sustainable.
Brazilian Real dropped 0.9% against the dollar today. Brazil had excessively high interest rates, so it was coming.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPY&lt;/span&gt; dropped 0.71%. This alone confirms the risk-offness of&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Inequality&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t embedded from this source before. Hope it works. 
The point is that the late 70&amp;#8217;s were the trough of inequality in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. 
After a long downward trend, once I became an adult, inequality started to increase and shows no sign of reversing.
This eventually will have political consequences, I&amp;nbsp;feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are certainly in a very strange world. 
A pandemic has trashed many visible parts of the economy: airlines, restaurants, hotels: i.e. 
mainly services.
It has left most manufacturing, and large scale retailing (especially Amazon) not only unscathed, but in a much stronger competitive position.
People have been denied the opportunity to spend money on &amp;#8220;frivolous&amp;#8221; services like holidays and drinks out.
So they&amp;#8217;ve spent money on stocks, Bitcoin, houses and electronic gadgets.
So the stockmarket is experiencing huge&amp;nbsp;gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve said myself, many times, that the stock market is not the economy. 
It&amp;#8217;s the expected net present value of future cash flows from the securities in it.
Thus, it depends on two radical sources of uncertainty.
Looking at dividends, for valuing stocks, it depends on future profits, which is a function of pricing power and the cost of all factors of production.
It also depends on future real non-equity funding&amp;nbsp;costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this stuff is very hard to get a hand on, although the last item should follow from a look at government bond prices, which strip out credit risk and economic risk.
It looks as though funding costs will remain very low, and so this should drive stocks higher.
But gearing isn&amp;#8217;t really going up much, because more and more equity has to be issued to feed the hunger of the C-suite.
Shares are bought back, but only to the extent that exec. comp. is diluting the&amp;nbsp;equity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now deeply into the zone where interest rates alone are enough to move the needle on economic activity, to really affect people&amp;#8217;s willingness (&amp;#8216;propensity&amp;#8217;) to save. 
Governments are having the bulk of their bond issuance purchased by central banks. 
Some politicians are making noises about sound money, but everyone is reading books about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt;.
We&amp;#8217;ve undershot inflation targets for so long, it seems inconceivable that even current monetizing of debt will dent the trend.
So, taxes won&amp;#8217;t rise, but debt will, and foreigners will (at least by us in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;) be expected to accept it in exchange for&amp;nbsp;imports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herb Stein said, a very long time ago, that if something cannot go on forever, it will have to stop. 
But Keynes said that things can go on for so long, the fact that will stop one day might well be of no interest to practical men.
And central bankers and politicians don&amp;#8217;t have to look ahead very far. 
And the bond bulls have been saying that monetary conditions are too tight for a long time.
So maybe in five years time, I&amp;#8217;ll still be saying that inflation is coming, either here, or to my grandchildren, or on my&amp;nbsp;gravestone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We seem to be stuck in a permanent risk on world, for certain assets, like equities. But a risk off world for others, like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt;. 
Normally when related markets get out of line there is some market neutral trade that can be put on which will take advantage of the inevitable mean reversion. 
Which I guess would be gold vs &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt;, or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TIPS&lt;/span&gt; vs Long Bond, or value factor equities vs momentum factor ones.
Or emerging market equities vs &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt;.
But the argument for these trades has been present a long time, and these trades would have lost money for a long time.
So, we have no option but to&amp;nbsp;wait.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Not Thanksgiving</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/not-thanksgiving.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-19T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-11-19:/not-thanksgiving.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Great&amp;nbsp;Reset&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, this was a reverse rotation into pandemic megacaps. 
Not really risk on or risk off.
No major economic news, but it seems that the rapid recovery we had seen is now running out of steam.
Yields fell a bit, and the dollar fell a tiny bit.
Bitcoin continued its meteoric rise. It has to fall at some point, but as $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; has shown an asset with no means of producing any income can rise for a lot longer than anyone can remain solvent.
The more the skeptics point out how insane the valuation is, the more it&amp;nbsp;rallies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; Green New&amp;nbsp;Deal&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is depressing about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; politics is how devoid politicians are of coming up with anything remotely original in terms of policy ideas.
Boris Johnson is promising wholly implausible benefits from a so-called &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-ten-point-plan-for-a-green-industrial-revolution"&gt;Green Industrial Revolution&lt;/a&gt;.
It&amp;#8217;s truly pathetic. 
There are good ideas around. &lt;a href="https://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/"&gt;The Copenhagen Consensus&lt;/a&gt; has loads of them.
But politicians much prefer to listen to idiot celebrities and opinion polls.
The Conservative Party has always shied away from rational economic analysis, and it&amp;#8217;s doing so again.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; has had a terrible economic performance, relative to the rest of the world, since the second world war.
Nobody, however is ever held to account. Just as the policies enacted in response to the Covid-19 pandemic have never been analyzed against alternatives considered at the time, nothing is ever&amp;nbsp;revisited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brexit is heading to be a disaster, with all the policy energy taken up looking at fisheries and industrial policy.
It seems clear that the economic damage, which might have been minimal if we&amp;#8217;d actually pursed free trade, will be&amp;nbsp;severe.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>A rare risk off day</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/a-rare-risk-off-day.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-11-18:/a-rare-risk-off-day.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Alex&amp;nbsp;Manzara&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guy is excellent. 
He was a guest on the Market Huddle,
and kindly wrote up a summary of his comments on his blog, &lt;a href="https://www.chartpoint.com/hit-it/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
He is a very smart guy.
The talk was about Eurodollar futures. 
These give some interesting options to get cheap exposure to rising rates at the long end.
Well worth&amp;nbsp;(re-)reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart for the&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the sophisticated understanding of economics since the 1950s has not resulted in any improvement in the rate of gdp per capita in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;. 
The highs generally seem to be lower, but the lows seem deeper, although&amp;nbsp;fewer.&lt;/p&gt;

It covers many topics from a technical discussion of the different measures of inflation to a political theory that comes pretty close to Marx&amp;#8217;s ideas: &lt;em&gt;Trends like this generally lead to rising populist politics on both the right and the left of the political spectrum (cracks in the system emerging from the pendulum swinging very far), as people sense that something isn’t working right with the established system, due to a problematic mix of political and corporate interests merging together into cronyism, but differ in what they think the root of the problem is and how to address it.&lt;/em&gt; The trend she is referring to is illustrated by this&amp;nbsp;chart:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which I think explains a lot of recent political phenomena, such as&amp;nbsp;Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyns general conclusions are pretty close to&amp;nbsp;mine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we are going to see a lot more money creation in the next few years, whatever the Fed spokesmen&amp;nbsp;say,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;consumer prices and prices of real assets are going to continue to&amp;nbsp;rise,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gold and precious metals will benefit from&amp;nbsp;inflation,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;other commodities will also benefit, but to a lesser extent, especially copper and uranium and&amp;nbsp;oil,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the yield curve will continue to&amp;nbsp;steepen,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we&amp;#8217;ll probably get more&amp;nbsp;riots.&lt;/li&gt;

The exception is Eurodollar futures (nothing to do with the Euro currency: just dollar deposits held by institutions outside of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;). 
They are liquid out for years, and have lots of options. 
The pricing of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ED&lt;/span&gt; futures, interest rate swaps, and bonds is intimately linked. I once wrote a library to back out zero coupon yield curves from strips of the prices of these things, but that was a long time ago.
I&amp;#8217;d forgotten about this until I listened to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbiiDoYcAWw&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;The Market Huddle with Alex Manzara&lt;/a&gt;. I tend to listen to this while making a meal, and I can normally follow &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, but this episode is probably best listened to on YouTube so you can see the charts.
A zero coupon rate curve is a prediction of future short term rates, as a simple arbitrarge argument will show. The reverse is true. I don&amp;#8217;t have time today, but I am going to see what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ED&lt;/span&gt; futures (symbol, confusingly &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GE&lt;/span&gt;, but nothing to do with General Electric) predict about the future. 
Everyone is predicting a melt up in long-dated yields, especially now Clarida is talking about the Fed issuing a digital currency.
Once actual people can get their hands on Fed reserves (as opposed to commercial banks), we&amp;#8217;ll really see some inflation&amp;nbsp;moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a big risk-on day driven by the announcement of another vaccine, this one from Moderna. We now have Russia, Pfizer and Moderna all slugging it out. The Russian vaccine is already being given to members of the public, without a second clinical trial. I guess if there is anything wrong with it, we&amp;#8217;ll be the last to find&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market seems to have lost interest in assets that produce no income: precious metals and currencies (well, developed market ones), and govt. bonds. The value stocks that were hammered by the pandemic are coming roaring back: energy, transport, banks. Copper seems now to be getting&amp;nbsp;bid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart for the&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rich are different. They have more money. And they compound more money still, because they are exposed to exploding asset&amp;nbsp;values.&lt;/p&gt;

It has puzzled me how the market can value companies like Peleton, or $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSX&lt;/span&gt;, or Casper Sleep, or $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIO&lt;/span&gt;, or $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WKHS&lt;/span&gt; so richly when the almost certainly can never generate income sufficient to cover their cost of capital (which, in any case, is as low as it is ever going to be, at least under an economy which is in any sense vaguely normal).
The answer is that money is flowing into these stocks in volume, and it&amp;#8217;s being created by commercial banks in response to signals from the central banks. 
Yes, I know, I know. This has been said over and over again, and yet there have been no&amp;nbsp;consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it seems that I&amp;#8217;m not the only one who thinks that something is rotten in the state of western economies. 
None other than Kenneth Rogoff has said, &lt;a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/covid19-currency-stability-unlikely-to-persist-long-term-by-kenneth-rogoff-2020-11"&gt;in Project Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; that the wheels are close to falling off the bus, that the tottering current account deficit of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; will not grow indefinitely before toppling. 
He also points out that when this happens, the consequences will be very serious for all of&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mohamed el-Erian has been warning for some while that we are in bubble territory. Really, most of his tweets are on the same theme, but this is a typical&amp;nbsp;one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This of course raises the question of what is a suitable yardstick? 
Gold is the traditional one, as the supply schedule is fairly stable, 
although the demand schedule, like that for any other unproductive asset is not.
A basket of consumer items is the traditional way to measure inflation, 
but  assets have a very different demand curve to these. 
To an extend the flows may be based simply on fashion.
The trend towards passive investing has certainly tended to favour liquid securities such as large cap stocks and government bonds.
The demographic profile has too. Baby boomers have a lot of assets, and they are reluctant to sell them while they are getting a low income from them. 
Especially when most western governments tend to tax capital much more lightly than income, supposedly to encourage investment. 
It is a mere coincidence and a convenience that the finance sector benefits a great deal from such an asymmetrical tax&amp;nbsp;treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another, recent, unit of account is bitcoin. This, by design, has a totally inelastic supply curve, which therefore makes its price a perfect function of demand. Certainly, many investors do not trust governments to keep a lid on the supply of money as much as they trust computer code written by a totally anonymous hacker to constrain the total number of bitcoins in existence capped. It must be depressing for Rishi Sunak and Andrew Bailey to think that they are trusted less than someone with a made up name (Satoshi Nakamoto) who may well be dead, or at least on his own island in the Caribbean drinking himself to&amp;nbsp;death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read somewhere that 80% of people who had ever acquired bitcoins were showing a profit now. Maybe this is&amp;nbsp;worrying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/kzL09es" data-context="false" &gt;&lt;a href="//imgur.com/a/kzL09es"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a technical point of view, I&amp;#8217;m not a buyer of bitcoin. 
It&amp;#8217;s like saying that bitcoin is digital gold. 
Yes, but digital gold, like a digital recording of a song, can be perfectly copied, over and over again.
The thousands of alt-coins mean that the supply of cryptocurrencies in aggregate is unlimited.
Of course the hodlers say&amp;nbsp;that &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that the Democrats are furiously painting themselves green, to appeal to millennial voters. 
This sounds negative for oil demand: how will Exxon survive in a country where everyone is forced to buy a&amp;nbsp;Tesla?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But prices are determined by the cost, and many of the Democratic policies will take out production. Assuming this moves the supply curve down across the reasonable range of oil prices, this is going to make oil more expensive, and will result in bigger profits for the established producers with low-cost wells. This is the thesis of &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4388227-biden-presidency-is-bullish-for-oil-prices"&gt;this article on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which seems fairly convincing to me, although it focuses almost exclusively on the supply side, and not on the demand side.  Historically, moves to green sources of energy seem hardly to have moved the needle on the steadily increasing demand for oil. It has had a fairly devastating impact on the demand for gas, so it may just be that this is because the supply/demand curve for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CO2&lt;/span&gt; emissions hasn&amp;#8217;t reached down into oil yet, because it&amp;#8217;s been killing demand for coal so&amp;nbsp;far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is an interesting graphic in its own&amp;nbsp;right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="policies" src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/11/4/saupload_El_ZGonX0AERq-V.jpeg =750x"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Markets&amp;nbsp;today&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the end of the week when the new vaccine was announced.
Stocks have been flying, with the exception of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; stocks, which are supposedly benefiting from the lockdowns.
Old economy stocks have outperformed, but over any timescale over a week or so the tsunami of Fed liquidity creation has surely been the bigger force.
It&amp;#8217;s started to push down the dollar again, but not by much.
I happened to notice that tobacco stocks are giving a yield of over 8% in some cases.
At some point, there will be no funds yet to divest of unethical stocks, and at that point some investors are going to start picking up these stocks for yield because &amp;#8220;If I don&amp;#8217;t own these, someone else will, and will be the receipient of big dividend cheques.&amp;#8221;
The complication is, however, that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CB&lt;/span&gt; liquidity will flow into the stocks which are bought by passive funds, 
and so the unfavoured stocks will continue to be unfavoured.
Nothing much can be done about this until the Boomers start to draw down their savings &lt;em&gt;en mass,&lt;/em&gt; which should trigger the mother of all reversals. 
I emphasise that the timescale for this is entirely unknown, but probably should be the end of the next forty&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Close&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty dull close. 
Value still outpacing growth by a good chalk, but both going up.
The key seems to go short of cash.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; still was close to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt;: 1.07% plays 1.38%. 
In currencies the biggest mover seems to have been &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MXP&lt;/span&gt;, the Mexican peso, up about 1% against the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; is down 0.25%
Commodities: copper up quite a lot, more than the precious metals. Steel is up quite a bit (6.5% over five days).
Wheat, corn &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; soy all up, modestly.
Energy down, but up on the&amp;nbsp;week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart for the&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a longer-term timescale, it would appear that the steepener trade is a pretty safe bet. 
This is the 30Y-5Y yield difference (which isn&amp;#8217;t the most perfect measure, but shows the direction of&amp;nbsp;movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One hundred and forty four thousand infections were recorded in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; yesterday.
Yes, that&amp;#8217;s a lot. 
More than the 92 patients who caught Covid in the Pfizer trial.
Maybe investors are starting to worry about what happens if the virus mutates, or resistance is very short lived, or it&amp;#8217;s impossible to produce and distribute at economic rates, 
or it causes death and blindness in 0.2% of those&amp;nbsp;vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Market&amp;nbsp;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A risk-off day.
The dollar is sinking, even against &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TRL&lt;/span&gt;, although not against &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBP&lt;/span&gt;. 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; is down 10bp, at roughly 93.
Precious metals are up, other commodities are down, oil by 1.2%.
Aluminium is an exception. 
Yields are basically flat.
Nearly all stock markets are&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart for the&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h1&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s best not to trade on such a day.
The tone seems to be moderately risk-on, but we&amp;#8217;ll have to wait until tomorrow for something definite.
The only notable thing that&amp;#8217;s come onto my radar is the spike up in the Turkish Lira.
It seems likely to reverse, but central banks talk to one another and can squeeze a bear market ruthlessly if the decide that they want to.
Emerging markets are generally having a great time because everyone is convinced that an effective vaccine is around the&amp;nbsp;corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today appears to be a retrace. 
Gold is still weak, but the growth stocks are now going up again.
There is some cynicism about the vaccine, not least because the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; of Pfizer unloaded a large chunk of his stock a very short time after the announcement, and more or less at the point of maximum profit. 
I guess the actual announcement was not inside information, but if there any reasons that the trial might be suspect which are known to him these, surely, would&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically a huge rotation back into the &amp;#8220;defensive&amp;#8221; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; mega-caps with a collapse in value stocks generally.
Most global equity markets up, not much action in currencies. 
Treasuries shut for Veterans&amp;#8217; Day.
Commodities were mixed, with most food down (except live cattle),
Most energy commodities up, with a couple of fractions down,
gold approx.&amp;nbsp;flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Economics&amp;nbsp;focus&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving aside the normal caveats about interpreting unemployment rates, it seems quite clear that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; has a much more flexible labour market than the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. 
This is going to cause some pain in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; in the months and years&amp;nbsp;ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

This makes &amp;#8220;green gilts&amp;#8221; sound definitely fake.
The idea is to issue bonds specifically to fund green infrastructure. 
I await the details, but I am not sure I&amp;#8217;ll be buying. Gilts in general look expensive right&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other&amp;nbsp;items&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kate Bingham is going, after it emerged that she&amp;#8217;d spent &amp;pound;670K on private &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PR&lt;/span&gt; consultants, when she could have used the existing government &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PR&lt;/span&gt; machine. The fact that she&amp;#8217;s married to Jesse Norman, and was chosen without the job being advertised is just a terrible&amp;nbsp;look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marcus Rashford is a hero, for forcing the government into a turnaround on providing &amp;#8220;free&amp;#8221; school meals in the holidays.
This is a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PR&lt;/span&gt; disaster of the first&amp;nbsp;water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; is going to miss some sort of target for increasing life expectancy in poor areas by fifty years, according to projections.
The very fact that a target should have been set at such an unrealistic value strongly suggests that the root causes of regional health and socioeconomic health disparities have been hugely&amp;nbsp;misjudged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Market&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some reversion from yesterday, although the general outline remains the same.
I am pleased that the initial findings of the trial have been so promising, but the total size of the sample of those who got Covid in both the vaccine and placebo group was 94, ten percent of which got the disease. This clearly could have been by chance, but anyway may depend on the actual virus not having had enough time (or location) to mutate enough. It also says nothing about how long the conferred resistance lasts. 
I think whatever happens, bonds are going&amp;nbsp;lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks are looking promising, at last. The steepening of the yield curve will help, the vaccine might allow them to pay divs again, the disasters of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GFC&lt;/span&gt; are still sufficiently recent that they haven&amp;#8217;t yet lowered their lending standards to a dangerous level, and the peer-to-peer lenders, which were supposed to offer competition have all disappeared, along with the fintech startups, which simply having got the lobbying bucks to stop themselves being regulated out of existence. I don&amp;#8217;t approve of banks, I just don&amp;#8217;t want to be on the wrong side of their lobbying&amp;nbsp;force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mid afternoon&amp;nbsp;comment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a much less crazy day than yesterday, but there is some risk-offness about it.
There is a big diversion between value and growth, with value seemingly more highly valued for the first time in a long while.
Bonds have stabilized, and are pretty steady.
Gold is drifting lower, but gently so.
Commodities are very mixed, energy generally up, including Nat. Gas!
Value stocks really seem to be about to have their day in the sun.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BYND&lt;/span&gt; dropped 20% on disappointing results. It would appear that Wall St. is no longer giving these profitless stocks an indefinite&amp;nbsp;pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing&amp;nbsp;wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precious metals seem to have recovered since the note above. 
Otherwise, the trend continues: value trumping growth, but with most sectors other than tech and comms going up.
Bonds flat, currencies more or less flat.
Gold took a serious hammering over the last few days, but now seems to be on a recovery track.
Barrick Gold Corp is profitable (P/E ~18) and even pays a dividend. It has modest debt ($5B in enterprise value of $50B).
If gold starts to be popular as an asset class, it&amp;#8217;s the biggest fish in a small pond, and will be the stock seeing strong buyer demand.

&lt;p&gt;As human we seek patterns in random data.
The current market conditions are pretty odd: the prices for growth stocks are unstoppable, but value stocks left in the dust. All while we have near zero (or sometimes negative) interest rates.
Not all of these conditions are the same as 1999, but quite a few of them&amp;nbsp;are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem is the extent to which &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; stocks, and commodities prices, have failed to benefit from asset price inflation generated by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt;.
In 1999 China had a huge demand for commodities. Today, the Chinese economy is dominated by services. 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; economies, and companies were much more indebted, especially borrowing in foreign currencies.
They were largely confined to miners and basic materials sectors, where they had little pricing&amp;nbsp;power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today seems different for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt;. A lot of trade is between &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; economies. China doesn&amp;#8217;t rely on selling cheap plastic stuff to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; any longer.
It produces a lot of high end products (like generic pharma) and home grown high tech. Certainly, the likes of Huawei depends in part on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; chips, but the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PRC&lt;/span&gt; state will stop at nothing to remove that dependency.
Already, expensive Apple phones are giving way to high quality Chinese and Korean substitutes. Luxury as a strategy has had a good run, but I can&amp;#8217;t see many Vietnamese consumers trading &amp;#8220;up&amp;#8221; to an iPhone from a&amp;nbsp;Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds prices have to weaken. Interest rates can get a bit lower, and even negative once governments mandate institutional savings to be invested in &amp;#8220;risk free&amp;#8221; Treasury bonds. But at some point even that arm twisting is going to fail and to fund all that fiscal deficit treasuries around the world will have no option but to offer higher yields. Once this starts, I simply can&amp;#8217;t see what will stop it, beyond a &amp;#8220;debt jubilee&amp;#8221; (effectively, central banks buying up all debt) or a purging dose of inflation the likes of which only Venezuelans and Zimbabweans have recently&amp;nbsp;experienced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; currencies must at some point rally. They are held back by risk, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; government liabilities in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; dollars remain, for the moment, the single safe asset that many savers are scrambling to hold. Eventually, this too will pass, and maybe &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; bonds will take their place. Until then, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; equities and bonds will have an attractive risk reward&amp;nbsp;ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Turkish&amp;nbsp;Lira&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, my prediction that the Turkish lira would fall after the departure of both the country&amp;#8217;s central bank governor and their finance minister was way off. The currency rallied 4% against &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EUR&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;. No doubt the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CB&lt;/span&gt; organized a bear squeeze. It will run out of dollars, probably quite soon, and the lira will resume its downward trajectory. Until then, it&amp;#8217;s best to stay&amp;nbsp;away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Biden&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are in the phase of frenzied speculation about people and policies. Nobody really knows, but there are acres of newsprint to fill, so a lot of speculation is printed.
Given that the result was so close, one might have thought that the more radical policies of the Dems would be dropped, and even some of the more centrist policies of the former regime retained. 
I fear that this is not the way things work (except legislation that is on the statute book will not be repealed).
Every new administration builds a new layer of &amp;#8220;new&amp;#8221; policies on top of thousands of layers of incompatible and inconsistent policies of its predecessors. 
And people like me bemoan the unanticipated outcomes of the congealed mass of legal text that forms the law.
The only people who are pleased with this situation are the lawyers, but they are the only ones that could rationalize the corpus of statute, and where would the billable hours be in&amp;nbsp;that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Container&amp;nbsp;Shipping&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a worldwide shortage of containers. The Baltic Dry Index has been hitting highs. Somehow there is a lot of shipping activity and possibly not enough&amp;nbsp;capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4374607-container-shipping-fundamentals"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; explains why investing in shipping lines is tricky. There is a tendency for the industry to generate excess capacity, resulting in a value-destroying collapse in shipping rates.
I don&amp;#8217;t really know where we are in the cycle, but I&amp;#8217;d like to understand this better because if there is a genuine shortage of capacity there could be profit opportunities over the timescale it takes for shipping lines to take deliver of new&amp;nbsp;ships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Polling&amp;nbsp;Failure&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Biden has (apparently) won, it&amp;#8217;s pretty clear that the mainstream polling organizations have failed again to get a good handle on the numbers. Obviously, they can widen the error bars they put on their estimates, but it seems that there is a systematic bias coming through in the numbers. We all know that we generally avoid disagreeing with someone for the sake of it. Even if we think that a person&amp;#8217;s view is misguided, we&amp;#8217;ll rarely try to correct it unless we have a strong incentive (e.g. to save that person making an expensive mistake, or because we will be adversely affected). Because Trump is so universally despised by &lt;em&gt;les bien pensants&lt;/em&gt; any member of the &lt;em&gt;hoi polloi&lt;/em&gt; will know perfectly well what a young (probably female) market researcher thinks and will simply make the more acceptable choice. Just as I will choose a salad for a starter when eating with my family, rather than a the black pudding and fried egg that I&amp;#8217;d much prefer to eat but will bring forth snorts of (good-natured)&amp;nbsp;derision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk on day. Pfizer got a vaccine approved, which is supposed to be 90% effective.
Risk assets took off (even though they were already higher than they were before the pandemic broke out).
Huge rotation from tech stocks to energy. 
Every equity market on the planet was up. France benefited a lot: up 6%. 
Silver miners got hammered. Silver dropped 5%. Gold got smashed. 
Bonds were down (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; 10-years now at 94bp vs 51 in Aug). 
Industrial metals and food commods are up, but not much. Copper down a tad.
Bitcoin down a&amp;nbsp;fraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard to see this enthusiasm being sustained for long, certainly in the equities&amp;nbsp;space. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the market thinks a Biden-Harris presidency will do is more important than what they will actually do.
It seems to me that the market expects Biden to borrow and spend, with the Fed as a willing accomplice.
The Green New Deal is one example of this, but I&amp;#8217;m sure all the civil engineers who&amp;#8217;ve been waiting four years for this moment will be dusting off their proposals for bridges and railways, especially in marginal states and districts.
Energy will fall a bit more, although it might rise on a &amp;#8220;sell on the news&amp;#8221; event. It wasn&amp;#8217;t as though Trump stood much chance of winning last Thursday.
Bonds might fall a bit. 
Although &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; has a lot of followers, most politicians, voters and mainstream economists are skeptics. 
At least we&amp;#8217;ll get an experimental test of the hypothesis, which the dismal science will benefit&amp;nbsp;from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, surely, we&amp;#8217;ll return to the 70&amp;#8217;s. Inflation will start to creep up and interest rates with the, and governments will face a constant battle to finance their deficits and to protect their currencies.
But not for now. For now, creating money has no downside. 
As Scott Sumner has been saying for years, we&amp;#8217;ve been running monetary policy far too tight, not too lose, because we focus too much on interest rates and not on the output&amp;nbsp;gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Turkish Lira going down the&amp;nbsp;tubes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erdogan has sacked his central bank governor. He believes that high interest rates create inflation and as a consequence cause the currency to sink.
He might have correlation on his side, but I&amp;#8217;m not sure about causation. Apparently, his ideas are derived from the writings of Irving Fisher, not someone with the same cachet as Keynes or Friedman today, but a serious enough economist to be sure.
And the first economist to emphasise that nominal interest rate is a function of both the real rate and the expected inflation rate (to a first-order approximation, their sum).&lt;br&gt;
Fisher argued that changing nominal rates (which is all that central banks can do) will have no effect on real rates (because inflation expectations will adjust) so monetary policy is impotent as a tool for stabilizing the real economy (including the current account deficit).
(I&amp;#8217;m not sure where Erdogan gets the idea that it works in the opposite direction to what you&amp;#8217;d&amp;nbsp;assume).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, sacking a central bank governor is never a good look when your currency is already on the slide, so I think it&amp;#8217;s pretty certain that the Lira will slump more on Monday, against practically every tradeable currency. Don&amp;#8217;t try to put on the trade now, or you&amp;#8217;ll get severe&amp;nbsp;whiplash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Film&amp;nbsp;recommendation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t watch many films, and those I do are usually very old. 
On Friday I watched &amp;#8220;The Client&amp;#8221; with Susan Sarandon. 
It is about the plight of a trailer park kid who witnesses the suicide of a bent lawyer who is being leaned on by the mob to keep quiet about the murder of a senator. 
The star, for me, was the kid, who was thoroughly convincing as a feral 12 year old from the wrong side of the tracks.
I looked him up, and I discovered that that was exactly what he was: a kid who was discovered by some scout and picked out as representing the sort of kid that was portrayed in the plot. 
Sadly, having shot to fame, and fortune, as a result of this appearance, he found he could not handle the new life he&amp;#8217;d been so rudely dropped into and ended up dying alone of a heroin overdose.
I hope he rests in&amp;nbsp;peace.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="USA"></category></entry><entry><title>6 Nov and still no Presidential Election Result</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/6-nov-and-still-no-presidential-election-result.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-11-06:/6-nov-and-still-no-presidential-election-result.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Chart of the&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the 30-year Breakeven Inflation Rate: i.e. the average &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPI&lt;/span&gt; rate which would make an investor indifferent between holding 30 year nominal gilts and 30 year &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TIPS&lt;/span&gt;.
The rate is still below the target rate of 2%, but it&amp;#8217;s approaching it at a very rapid rate, having recovered from a dive to 1.3 in March.
Obviously, in the past, the Fed has tightened too soon, but I don&amp;#8217;t think Powell will risk a Taper Tantrum or Repo Madness this time, and his Average Inflation Targetting will give him cover for the rate to drift well above the target&amp;nbsp;rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the Fed mainly looks at the 5-year 5-year equivalent of this, which is much more noisy, but not inconsistent. There is a recent dip, presumably the second wave, but my guess is that this won&amp;#8217;t have the same impact on inflation expectations as the first, because the market will expect the bazooka&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="embed-container"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=xtGR&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More or less a risk neutral day.
Biden still hasn&amp;#8217;t won, and neither has Trump.
Non-farm payrolls beat consensus, at 638,000, but the unemployment rate is now 6.9%. This is grisly by any normal&amp;nbsp;measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crude was&amp;nbsp;down,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Govt. bond yields were up, but show no clear&amp;nbsp;trend,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Energy was hammered, as you&amp;#8217;d&amp;nbsp;expect, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gold was up, a tiny&amp;nbsp;bit,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Steering the&amp;nbsp;Economy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m reading a book of this title by Samuel Brittan. He looks at the Treasury in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; from the time of the 1951 election to some time in the 70&amp;#8217;s, including the Heath administration. Although I was alive for some of this time, I didn&amp;#8217;t really take much interest in what the Treasury was doing.
Reading the book seems like reading about another country. 
The Treasury was constantly trying to slow down demand growth so that we didn&amp;#8217;t get a balance of payments crisis and a run on the pound.
We seemed always to be borrowing from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMF&lt;/span&gt; to pay for imports.
The unemployment rate hovered around 1.1%: a number that is inconceivable today.
Labour was regarded quite favourably by business, because they took the needs of industry and the goal of improving productivity much more seriously than the Tories. They also had some first class economic brains in the cabinet and shadow cabinet: people like Hugh Gaitskill and Harold&amp;nbsp;Wilson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now nobody every talks about the level of the pound, but the 1967 devaluation, although not the first in the period, was a deeply traumatic event. 
I suppose that with all governments today furiously debasing their currencies, we&amp;#8217;ve arrived, by accident, at a regime of relatively stable relative rates.
The only evidence that the currencies are being debased is their performance against a reference material such as oil or gold (or a suitable basket of commodities although that tends always to be dominated by the price of&amp;nbsp;oil).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Covid-19&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone seems to have lost interest in this. 
I am sure that it&amp;#8217;s a good thing. 
The twenty-fifth most common cause of death in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; should not be a subject that dominates our waking hours.
The bill for the economic damage caused by this pandemic is surely going to come in at north of 500bln pounds.
This is an awful lot of money for the sake of saving a few thousand excess deaths.
Of course, it&amp;#8217;s hard to know how many people would have died, but at 0.3% mortality, which seems high, we&amp;#8217;d be looking at maybe 200K deaths. So maybe the cost would be of the order of  2.5m pounds per life saved, or maybe ten times the threshold for an extra quality adjusted life year.
Given that the median age of death is around 80, maybe in terms of QALYs it&amp;#8217;s only 2-5 times the threshold.
Whatever it is, it&amp;#8217;s a big spend, but probably would be supported by most&amp;nbsp;voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart for the&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something happened in 2007 which killed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; productivity growth. That&amp;#8217;s not everything, but in the long run it&amp;#8217;s nearly everything. 
The future is bleak if this does not&amp;nbsp;change.&lt;/p&gt;

The years of wrangling over Brexit is a template for what will come.
Only Covid could stop Britons arguing about it. I wonder what will bring the arguments over Trump to an&amp;nbsp;end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Markets&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bank of England is sounding ultra-dovish, about to buy an additional &amp;pound;150B of gilts.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt; forecasts now incorporate a no-deal outcome for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; gilt yields didn&amp;#8217;t blink. 
They are obviously waiting until they see the whites of the eyes of inflation.
Gold has caught a bid, stocks are up. The market seems ultra-relaxed about a Biden presidency, 
presumably on the assumption that all those campaign contributions from the bulge-bracket banks have done the trick, and that all that tough talk about actually taxing corporate America was a bluff got collect&amp;nbsp;votes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/11/04/battle-of-the-narratives-for-stocks-any-election-outcome-is-now-an-ideal-outcome-even-a-disputed-election-long-legal-mess-split-government-without-stimulus-whatever/"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt;, another from Wolf Richer, points out the absurdity of every outcome for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; elections being more positive for stocks. So much for the Efficient Market Hypothesis, which would day that prior prices would have fully discount the expected&amp;nbsp;outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Lockdown&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; is experiencing it&amp;#8217;s own Groundhog Day purgatory. The (supposedly finished) furlough scheme has been disinterred (maybe actually on Halloween!) and will pay millions of bar staff to sit at home playing video games.
It&amp;#8217;s lucky that that Andrew Bailey, that nice BoE Governor, is willing to pick up the tab. 
Nobody actually uses the words &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt;, but surely that&amp;#8217;s exactly what we&amp;#8217;re&amp;nbsp;doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Interesting&amp;nbsp;reads&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a huge fan of Scott Sumner. He has been saying that monetary conditions are too tight for a long time, and I believe he&amp;#8217;s spot on.
He has written &lt;a href="https://www.econlib.org/arnold-kling-on-modigliani-miller-and-money/"&gt;a blog post, where he disagrees with Arnold Kling&lt;/a&gt;.
It&amp;#8217;s about monetary policy and the Modigliani-Miller theorem, two of my favourite things.
I have no idea who is right, but it&amp;#8217;s worth reading. 
Money is odd stuff. Sumner gives an analogy where he compares it to platinum. 
I am not totally sure that this works, but maybe in the short run his analysis is&amp;nbsp;correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Zoom a digital alternative to transport&amp;nbsp;infrastructure&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/11/03/us-apartment-rental-market-splits-in-two-100-cities-where-rents-jumped-or-dropped-the-most-where-rents-are-highest-or-lowest/"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; gives a lot of stats about how rents in the most crowded, expensive cities have come down but those in the secondary and tertiary cities have jumped up. Rents and transport costs are substitutes: you can pay a lot and live in the Square Mile, but have no travel costs or you can pay much less and spend a fortune on railway season tickets. Now there is another competing service that has basically killed TfL: Zoom (and all the familiar apps that we use to&amp;nbsp;communicate). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s often hard to see what underlying need something like a transport network is serving, but it is still communication, just like in Roman times where the roads were built so that messengers could carry scrolls back to&amp;nbsp;Rome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Zoom has no deep moat, and although it&amp;#8217;s share price has, well, zoomed, it can&amp;#8217;t last for long as there are too many well-established competing products. It&amp;#8217;s not as though Skype ever made any money for anyone apart from the original&amp;nbsp;developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite an exciting day. Very risk&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Banks up across the&amp;nbsp;board,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bubble stocks up almost across the board, except $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNAP&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TWLO&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frauds up generally, with a few egregious frauds&amp;nbsp;down,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commodities up a&amp;nbsp;lot,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dollar heavily down ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; down&amp;nbsp;0.82%),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bonds pretty flat (spookily so, given what happened to the&amp;nbsp;dollar),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gold up a lot, oil&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J Powell gave a presser where he didn&amp;#8217;t really say anything new, but somehow calmed the&amp;nbsp;markets. &lt;/p&gt;

It still seems hard to believe that the Dems could put up such a weak candidate.
Choosing the candidate was a balancing act. Biden was always going to be able to raise the most money,
and comfortably outspent Trump. 
But it seems that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; voters are not so easily persuaded by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; advertising. 
Good for&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks as though the Senate will remain R and Congress D, which will mean that radical bills from either side will be harder to&amp;nbsp;pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of when I finished, the race was still undecided. Of course, a race between a pair of geriatrics was never going to be that&amp;nbsp;fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ADP&lt;/span&gt; estimated an indicative jobs number of 365K  for October. This is half of September&amp;#8217;s, but is still good compared to&amp;nbsp;equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody (in these days of floating exchange rates) worries about the current account (or &amp;#8216;balance of payments&amp;#8217;). That certainly doesn&amp;#8217;t mean that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; is exporting more than it&amp;nbsp;imports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonds are really all over the shop. The 30 year &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; T bond future is up 0.18% (i.e. yield down 1.6bp). The yield hasn&amp;#8217;t gone anywhere since early March, and is basically where it was when it spiked down in response to the beginning of the pandemic panic. 
Given that the pandemic is now having more of an impact on global capacity than it was then, we are either going to have another colossal burst of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; &amp;infin; or else the lockdown is going to magically have no impact on the real&amp;nbsp;economy.&lt;/p&gt;

Certainly, a lot of overvalued (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMHO&lt;/span&gt;) stocks are trending lower. Maybe this is when holders decide to hedge with&amp;nbsp;puts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s driving this is, of course, the CBs. &lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/c3auyavgiK"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; gives the relative picture of what the big four are doing.
The non-Jap banks have quite a long way to go before they get to the BoJ&amp;#8217;s position of owning 50% of all the debt.
I feel that they don&amp;#8217;t have so far before they get to the point where they cause their economies to stagnate, like Japan&amp;#8217;s.
I listened to &lt;a href="https://macromusings.libsyn.com/matt-ygelsias-on-one-billion-americans-new-ideas-to-revitalize-the-american-economy"&gt;Matt Ygelsias on Macro Musings&lt;/a&gt;.
He&amp;#8217;d argue that Japan&amp;#8217;s stagnation is a result of it&amp;#8217;d dwindling (and aging) population.
I&amp;#8217;m sure there is something to this. It&amp;#8217;s a good podcast, and certainly makes the case for vastly increased immigration in to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;.
Sadly, as so often, a very sensible policy, from&amp;nbsp;a &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;There are only so many cars and exercise bikes a person can&amp;nbsp;buy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4383057-blowout-q3-gdp-sets-stage-for-double-dip-recession-and-bear-market-decline-in-stocks?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=seeking_alpha&amp;amp;mail_subject=lawrence-fuller-blowout-q3-gdp-sets-the-stage-for-a-double-dip-recession-and-bear-market-decline-in-stocks&amp;amp;utm_campaign=rta-author-article&amp;amp;utm_content=link-0"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; points out that spending on services is still well down, with the bounceback driven by spending on goods.
The problem is that there is only so much you can spend on durable goods before you simply have too much to go on.
You can sell the ones you bought earlier, secondhand, but that&amp;#8217;s just going to depress the purchases made by other&amp;nbsp;consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Political&amp;nbsp;Footnote&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wealthiest-1-percent-stole-50-trillion-working-americans-what-means-2020-9?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T"&gt;The wealthiest 1% has taken $50 trillion from working Americans and redistributed it, a new study finds. Here&amp;#8217;s what that means.&lt;/a&gt;.
The case for some sort of aggressively redistributive policies is growing. Huge social dislocations, like the Great War and the Great Recession and the Second World War and (in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;) the Vietnam War resulted in major programmes of redistribution (old age pensions in Britain, the New Deal in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, the Beveridge&amp;#8217;s Welfare State in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; and Johnson&amp;#8217;s Great Society in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;). 
I&amp;#8217;ve seen lots of proposals (&lt;a href="https://qz.com/1304742/eric-posner-and-glen-weyls-radical-markets-aims-to-fix-inequality-but-raises-moral-dilemmas/"&gt;this one seems good&lt;/a&gt;) but however it&amp;#8217;s done, unless we disenfranchise those impoverished by Covid-19 we are going to see some major transfer payments. 
Already Americans are waiting for their Green New Deal. I fear something of this ilk will be adopted in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. 
This will be a replay of how the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; govt. paid for the last war: by keeping real interest rates&amp;nbsp;negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solidly risk-off day today. Slight spike at the close, but pretty clear cut direction.
Against the conventional wisdom, the dollar was pretty flat (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; up 0.12% but down 0.77% vs &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MXP&lt;/span&gt;).
Likewise yields of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasuries were &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt;. 
I am sure there will be more money creation and stimulus, but some of the crazier stock prices might come down to earth.
I&amp;#8217;ve been waiting a long time for bonds to peak. This may or not be the point, but we have to be nearer it now than we were in&amp;nbsp;1990.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of questions over Tesla &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FSD&lt;/span&gt; going into public beta. Waymo are miles ahead of Tesla, and it seems clear that people are going to die.

It&amp;#8217;s just a pity that it cannot bring as many resources to check key information on directors and shareholders of the legal entities in the registers it maintains. As anyone who has read &amp;#8220;Private Eye&amp;#8221; will know, Companies House is a key reason why London is the global capital of money laundering. You can read more &lt;a href="https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/anonymous-company-owners/getting-uks-house-order/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Monetary&amp;nbsp;Policy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am reading Samuel Brittan&amp;#8217;s book about the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; Treasury. It&amp;#8217;s called something like &amp;#8220;Steering the Economy.&amp;#8221; 
He was writing at the time (1970) when there were faint stirrings of the idea that monetary policy could be used to affect the real economy.
You can tell he was sceptical, but he conceded the point that if the BoE kept buying Treasury securities, eventually interest rates would go down which would result in some capital projects being approved through a drop in the hurdle rate.
He pointed out that, in general, when the BoE buys gilts, the private sector actor who gets the money does not spend it, thereby increasing demand. He simply invests it in some other asset. 
Poor old Sam is no longer with us, but he&amp;#8217;d have no problem explaining the &amp;#8220;parabolic&amp;#8221; rise in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; stockmarket in the teeth of a global&amp;nbsp;pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Market&amp;nbsp;Commentary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk on today. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; growing more strongly than expected (but from a reduced&amp;nbsp;base). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PINS&lt;/span&gt; (Pinterest) up 36%!! This counts as a value stock, by today&amp;#8217;s standards. It&amp;#8217;s not simply that is it trading at only 1,760 times earnings, it&amp;#8217;s that it actually &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; earnings.
I am thinking about loading up on out of the money calls as a safety-first way of investing in this emerging blue chip&amp;nbsp;stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar keeps going up, even though it seems a sure sell.
I guess this is basically the case with all consensus directional bets.
Everyone knows that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; interest rates are heading down, and will almost certainly become negative, that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; inflation is going to rip, that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; trade deficit is humongous and getting bigger, that Biden will reverse most of Trumps mercantile tariffs, and worsen that deficit, that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury is going to keep creating more of the so-called &amp;#8220;world&amp;#8217;s only safe asset&amp;#8221; to the point where every foreign bank can&amp;#8217;t take any more.
Well, that&amp;#8217;s the bear case. 
The bull case is that the dollar may look like a shitty currency, but wait until see the&amp;nbsp;alternatives!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it&amp;#8217;s too hard to call, but somehow I think eventually we&amp;#8217;re going to see the dollar (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; futures) heading&amp;nbsp;south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Precious metals&amp;nbsp;plug&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some gold and silver miners catching a bid today: $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AGI&lt;/span&gt; up nearly 13% on results, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AEM&lt;/span&gt; (a much bigger operation) up 3.4%. 
There is talk about China offering a gold-backed digital currency.
The central banks have been looking into digital currency issuance for a long time, as they are running out of ammunition, even having used &amp;#8220;unconventional&amp;#8221; monetary policy.
A digital currency is the perfect way of bypassing the problem of a collapse of the velocity of circulation: a digital currency could be time limited.
If every citizen gets $5,000 in a digital wallet, created out of thin air by the Fed they are likely to spend it.
Especially if they are told that it will disappear into /dev/nul at the stroke of midnight on 31&amp;nbsp;Dec.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People seem to be getting more interested in silver, as it is cheap, relative to gold, and it&amp;#8217;s in relatively high demand because of its use in solar panels.
It is also being picked up by various hedge funds and investors, such as Berkshire Hathaway.
Precious metals, as a proportion of the universe of securities, is a tiny part. 
Once demand from industrial users and investors starts to move together,
it seems perfectly possible that a rapid rise could be observed.
It also appears that gold has been classified as a Tier 1 asset for banks to hold: the only &amp;#8220;fully safe&amp;#8221; asset other than&amp;nbsp;Treasuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold has performed remarkably well as an asset, over many&amp;nbsp;years. &lt;/p&gt;

Social media and Google stocks down because of congressional hearing.
This is the sort of market where everything that can be sold is sold.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; stocks are all faltering, but they have a long way to go.
Don&amp;#8217;t take my word for this. David Einhorn believes the same.
You can read his Q3 letter &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4381662-greenlight-capital-q3-2020-letter"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Cartelisation of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;services&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is weird about the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; is that they don&amp;#8217;t seriously compete with each&amp;nbsp;other:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon Prime and YouTube offer movies, but they are not serious competitors to&amp;nbsp;Netflix,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google makes the odd pixel handset but doesn&amp;#8217;t seriously compete with the&amp;nbsp;iPhone,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Pay is a thing, but nobody uses it, and it doesn&amp;#8217;t really work in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; (or it didn&amp;#8217;t last time I&amp;nbsp;checked).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bing is a search engine, but well: do &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; use&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Hangouts works, but doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to seriously compete with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MS&lt;/span&gt; Teams or Facetime or Skype or&amp;nbsp;Whatsapp,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google shut down Google&amp;nbsp;Plus,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google makes ChromeOS, but doesn&amp;#8217;t make a serious competitor to Windows. None of the main players make any effort to support&amp;nbsp;Ubuntu,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google pay squillions of dollars to Apple to use its search engine as the iPhone&amp;nbsp;default,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Azure now seems a viable competitor to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWS&lt;/span&gt;, and Google Cloud Platform is becoming a thing, but they all left Amazon alone for an amazing amount of&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could go on, but this looks suspiciously like a profit maximizing strategy for the (small number of) players and a not very good deal for the consumer. What is weird is that rather than secretly agreeing to rig the price, this cooperation seems to be an agreement to carve up the market to allow each participant to gain a monopoly in one service. 
Because the services are often free at the point of consumption (actually paid for by the hard work of the users who supply the providers with valuable training for their machine learning algorithms), the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; competition authories choose not to get involved, because they wrongly assume that consumption of a service which carries no monetary price cannot be&amp;nbsp;harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are various proposals for fixing this problem, notably by &lt;a href="https://journals.openedition.org/oeconomia/6984?lang=en"&gt;Posner and Weyl&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, our idiot politicians are unlikely to understand the problem, let alone the solution.

I don&amp;#8217;t suppose she&amp;#8217;ll be quite as bad as the progressives fear, but it&amp;#8217;s depressing that the judicial pillar is so heavility politicized in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;.
The root case is the extent to which power is concentrated in the hands of the&amp;nbsp;state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Markets&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a fairly violent risk off day yesterday, the markets are pretty flat or up.
I assume this will continue until so new massive stimulus package is announced, which might not be until after the election.
Interestingly, 10 year yields continue to&amp;nbsp;increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Growth vs.&amp;nbsp;Value&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Growth&amp;#8221; stocks have doubled in price, relative to &amp;#8220;value&amp;#8221; stocks over the last three years.
This has basically the worst relative performance in the last two hundred years, according to &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fc7ce313-92f8-4f51-902b-f883afc1e035"&gt;the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which is reporting on &lt;a href="https://www.twocenturies.com/blog/2020/5/11/value-investing-even-deeper-history"&gt;a study done by Mikhail Samonov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tentative conclusion is that over a long term, value investing gives good returns. 
Of course, this time might be&amp;nbsp;different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="this" src="https://koyfin.com/s/Fto7fL21G5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m writing this before the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; markets close, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t look as though today will be very exciting.
Generally, it&amp;#8217;s risk all over the place, with the mega caps doing better than the rest, with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NQ&lt;/span&gt; yet again green with the Dow and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; red. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFLX&lt;/span&gt; was down a bit. It seems to be running out of new&amp;nbsp;customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAP&lt;/span&gt; share price crashed yesterday by 20% on a forecast cut in revenues. This market is fragile.
Every newspaper is full of &amp;#8220;Green&amp;#8221; political initiatives. This will be a huge cost for future generations, 
incurred without any credible cost benefit&amp;nbsp;case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St James&amp;#8217;s Place has been targetted by an activist investor.
The Hut Group share price has zoomed up 45% since the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IPO&lt;/span&gt;. I remain a sceptic.

This is almost a full house of risk off, although &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPY&lt;/span&gt; is down a bit, as is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHF&lt;/span&gt;.
With these two and dollars as all safe haven currencies, one or two are bound to be down,
even in the most risk off&amp;nbsp;environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covid numbers seem to be relentlessly rising, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; election race is a mess, the vaccine seems to be further away than ever.
This seems to result in widespread risk off behaviour.

&lt;p&gt;Michael Platt of Bluecrest &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/goodalexander/status/1320193541453336576"&gt;seems to know what he&amp;#8217;s doing&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://kodakmoats.wordpress.com/"&gt;Moats Like Kodak&lt;/a&gt; is an interesting&amp;nbsp;blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more articles are being written mentioning the threat of inflation, especially in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What asset&amp;nbsp;when?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many tradable assets, all are affected by major macro developments.
It&amp;#8217;s difficult enough to come to a settled view of the macro outlook.
To make money it&amp;#8217;s essential to translate that view into a position.
The major asset classes are &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt;, fixed income, credit, commodities and equities.
These all tend to be priced in currency, especially &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;, so a view on the dollar is, in some sense,
implicit in taking a &amp;#8216;cash&amp;#8217; position in any. This is why, even though the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; current account looks terrible,
the dollar has held up well this year.
Market participants crave liquidity, especially dollars, at times of stress,
so they can re-enter the market when the stress is lifted (&amp;#8220;risk off&amp;#8221; becomes &amp;#8220;risk on&amp;#8221;).
This noise can swamp trend moves in the dollar.
In the same way, a rush into &amp;#8220;safe assets&amp;#8221; such as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasuries can swamp the negative implications of huge budget&amp;nbsp;deficits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect that successful trading is mainly about spotting the change in market psychology that indicates the point (&amp;#8220;inflection point&amp;#8221;) when the balance of participants are more worried about bullish factors than bearish factors (or vice versa).
My feeling is that we must be close when the consensus is that the dollar is over valued, and inflation is becoming a problem.
We&amp;#8217;re not there yet, and there seems to be a lot of slack in most economies, but my feeling is that it will be hard to put the spare capacity to work to produce stuff that people want to consume.
I don&amp;#8217;t know, but that&amp;#8217;s my view today.
If you don&amp;#8217;t like it, don&amp;#8217;t worry, I&amp;#8217;ll have a different one tomorrow.&amp;nbsp;Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Miners&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that precious metals miners might be interesting, if things get rough with the FAANGs.

&lt;h1&gt;Does the Fed have any influence on stock&amp;nbsp;prices?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J Powell emphatically answers &amp;#8220;of course not&amp;#8221; (&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-29/powell-says-fed-policies-absolutely-don-t-add-to-inequality"&gt;yeah, right&lt;/a&gt;) but the correlation between M1 (which the Fed definitely can influence) and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; is&amp;nbsp;spooky:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exactly who and when this is depends on whether the debt is inflated away, defaulted on or paid back via taxation (i.e. forcing individuals to consume less than they produce). 
Stephen King wrote &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/bcb523c3-7448-4cd6-a2d2-69b8f13be8f3"&gt;a piece in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; today&lt;/a&gt; which points out that when government spends (i.e. uses resources) someone somewhere gives up resources as a consequence.
The article is a hatchet job on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt;.
The article says that Covid spending will have to be paid back, but &lt;em&gt;if there really a demand deficit in the economy&lt;/em&gt; it might be the time for the government to commandeer those resources to produce physical capital which will have a positive return in the&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt; issued its own bonds, at a yield considerably higher than the German Treasury (although still negative).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-powell-digitalcurrency/feds-powell-more-important-for-u-s-to-get-digital-currency-right-than-be-first-idUKKBN2741OI"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; is about the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FED&lt;/span&gt; toying with the idea of issuing a digital currency.
This is equivalent to allowing ordinary consumers to have an account with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FED&lt;/span&gt;, and not just the commercial banks and the&amp;nbsp;Treasury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a big difference between &amp;#8220;base money&amp;#8221; and money that consumers can spend. 
Increasing reserves, and encouraging commercial banks to swap their Treasurys for these reserves, which is what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; amounts to,
does not create consumer spending power and does nothing to increase demand.
This has been proved beyond all reasonable doubt by the experience of the BoJ over the last three&amp;nbsp;decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if we can all have balances at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FED&lt;/span&gt;, and then it starts pressing the button to start electronic money printing,
we will at last see some actual inflation. This is precisely what Lacy Hunt says in his latest quarterly report.
He doesn&amp;#8217;t think it&amp;#8217;s going to happen. 
I suspect that Trump, Biden and Powell (as well as Mnuchin and Pelosi) have different ideas.
Hunt&amp;nbsp;states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The second risk would bring a rising inflationary dynamic into the picture, potentially becoming much more consequential. General disappointment with trying to solve economic underperformance by more indebtedness may crystalize along with the realization that debt will not work any better in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; than in Japan, the Euro Area and many other countries. As this dissatisfaction intensifies, either de jure or de facto, the Federal Reserve’s liabilities could be made legal tender, or a medium of exchange. Already, the Fed has taken actions that appear to exceed the limits of the Federal Reserve Act under the exigent circumstances clause, but so far, they are still lending and not directly funding the expenditures of the government in any meaningful way. But some advocate making the Fed’s liabilities spendable and a few central banks have already moved in this direction. If the Fed&amp;#8217;s liabilities were made a medium of exchange, the inflation rate would rise and inflationary expectations would move ahead of actual inflation. In due course, Gresham’s law could be triggered as individuals move to hold commodities that can be consumed or traded for consumable items. This would result in a massive decline in productivity, thus real growth and the standard of living would fall as inflation escalates. Lower and moderate income households would be the most adversely effected. Velocity would rise dramatically. This would make Treasury bills and inflation adjusted Treasury securities far more preferable compared to longer dated Treasury&amp;nbsp;bonds.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can access the reports &lt;a href="https://hoisingtonmgt.com/economic_overview.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can understand why the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FED&lt;/span&gt; is thinking about this. Base money creation, which is in the power of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FED&lt;/span&gt;, is simply not provoking an increase in spendable money balances (M2). This chart of the money multiplier (i.e M2/base money) shows that we&amp;#8217;re likely to lapse back into deflation if the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; govt doesn&amp;#8217;t start spending money soon, or the digital helicopter drop method is not&amp;nbsp;attempted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Miller and Mogdiliani falsely&amp;nbsp;fingered&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robin Wigglesworth in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/87efe5a9-4cb6-493b-a31a-f9efd5ddd242"&gt;blames&lt;/a&gt; Miller and Modigliani for the stock market bubbles we&amp;#8217;ve seen in recent decades.
In my view this is total nonsense. They proved that funding costs would not be reduced by replacing equity with debt &lt;em&gt;in the absence of distorting taxes favouring debt.&lt;/em&gt; Of course, politicians, egged on by greedy CEOs did precisely that.
The consequence was a rush of companies looking to gear up to the hilt, with predictable consequences as far as resilience in the face of an economic downturn was concerned.
This is equivalent to people blaming Ronald Coase for the disaster which was the privatization of Russian nationalized industries. He said that in the absence of transaction costs, assets find their most economically favourable owner. 
But his point was that transaction costs frequently dominate, so the last thing you should do is privatize willy nilly.
In fact, he made a great argument for nationalizing a lot of industries that have been privatized in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. 
He must be spinning in his&amp;nbsp;grave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Nick Clegg: Facebook&amp;nbsp;Shill&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick Clegg is now engaged in &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/98cf847c-96f9-4558-9a30-7d72ea4e79c2"&gt;special pleading for his employer, Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.
I am not sure he&amp;#8217;s exactly a shill, because his affiliation is printed at the start of his article.
But the idea that if the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; enforces higher standards of transparency and responsibility on Facebook et al. we&amp;#8217;ll all soon be without videoconferencing, Internet shopping and &amp;#8220;social media&amp;#8221; (presumably equated to Facebook) is nonsense.
I presume that Nick is on the phone every day lobbying his former colleagues in government, pushing the same message.
What I can&amp;#8217;t understand is what is going through the mind of someone like that, and how the marginal benefit of getting more money on top of what is already a good income can offset the pain of the cognitive dissonance he must be experiencing, unless he is very, very stupid&amp;nbsp;indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, I know that a shill is someone who conceals his links to the cause he&amp;#8217;s promoting, but I just liked the sound of the&amp;nbsp;phrase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be more stimulus: Mnuchin and Pelosi have finished the political theatre.
All equities up. Energy particularly.
All govt. yields up (except Germany: the market thinks that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; is going to crash?).
Commodities very strong. Even copper is up. Nat Gas up and seems to be less volatile. 
There seems to be a slight swing towards growth and away from value, except for the megacaps.
Bitcoin seems to be catching a bid.
Overall, risk on.

&lt;h1&gt;Steepner&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports of the &amp;#8220;steepener&amp;#8221; trade coming into its own have been heard increasingly lately.
It is linked to inflation expectations, of course.
I created this graph in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FRED&lt;/span&gt;, which seems to show that it really is a thing. 
For the brave, the recipe is long five five-year treasury note future to (short) one 30-year treasury bond one.

&lt;p&gt;Not close of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, but close of Europe.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; weak.
Commodities broadly positive, metals, agricultural and energy. Miners mixed.
Equities: Europe off a bit, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: 8:15pm &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;. Equity indexes all collapsed quite hard on news that Pelosi has given the Republicans 48 hours to reach a deal on the stimulus amount. I am not following this closely, but I believe that both parties have, at separate times, proposed $2.2T without the other side agreeing on the&amp;nbsp;amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASDAQ&lt;/span&gt; Index and the&amp;nbsp;steepener&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to the market huddle, with Nick Givanovic. 
He basically tried to argue that equity market movements, and especially the Nasdaq, were entirely driven by movements in the bond market.
He&amp;#8217;s a lot richer than me, but this just isn&amp;#8217;t true. Plotting the 5-30 yield spread against the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; gives a chart which shows no correlation at all, to speak&amp;nbsp;of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is the so-called &amp;#8220;Fed model&amp;#8221; of the stockmarket, i.e. that index levels are an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPV&lt;/span&gt; of a future series of dividend flows which never change. It just doesn&amp;#8217;t work, mainly because profits, and therefore dividends, depend on what his happening in the economy&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Declining marginal revenue product of&amp;nbsp;debt&lt;/h1&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s probably better to read the original Hoisington report &lt;a href="https://hoisingtonmgt.com/economic_overview.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;h1&gt;Peak&amp;nbsp;Bubble&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I urge you to sign up to the Credit Bubble Bulletin. It&amp;#8217;s free, and has a good summary of what&amp;#8217;s going on in the&amp;nbsp;markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has a weekly rant about how terrible everything is, but the awful thing is that it&amp;#8217;s right. 
Eventually, all this will go down in flames. 
I, like everyone else, is hoping that the reset will not happen in my lifetime (which, to be fair, is quite&amp;nbsp;likely):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NickGiva"&gt;Nick Givanovic&lt;/a&gt;. I heard him on The Market Huddle. It&amp;#8217;s interesting to compare his tone on the programme and on Twitter. Costs money ($250?) to follow him on Twitter, but to be fair, you can download his historical tweets to see if he has been right historically.

&lt;p&gt;Bonds were down a bit: 10 year govts. were up very modestly (0.2%, but a percentage change in a yield doesn&amp;#8217;t communicate much). The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; 10 year yield is now at 0.741%, which while low is materially up on the 0.67% a week or so ago.
Broader equity markets are generally up, but most commodities&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Ideas&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is advocating a change to value &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/15/goldman-sachs-says-its-time-to-buy-value-stocks-and-sell-some-tech.html"&gt;reported here&lt;/a&gt;.
One way to implement this would be to go long $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IWN&lt;/span&gt; vs $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VONG&lt;/span&gt;, factor ETFs for value and growth respectively, from Russell 2000 universe. Unicorn Bay thinks that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IWN&lt;/span&gt; has a beta of ~0.77, whereas &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VONG&lt;/span&gt; has one of approx 0.95. 
For rough market neutrality, you&amp;#8217;d need to buy approx 5 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IWN&lt;/span&gt; for for every 4 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VONG&lt;/span&gt;. This is not investment advice, and this would remain a very risky pair position and in any case it&amp;#8217;s a widely held view that Goldman puts out a strategy like this in the public domain when they want to close out their own positions. You have been warned!
You can use the beta calculator tool &lt;a href="https://unicornbay.com/tools/beta-calculator"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

It basically says that a lot of positive data is misleading: particularly diffusion indexes (like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PMI&lt;/span&gt; readings). The fact that after a catastrophic drop in output a lot of purchasing managers expect things to be a bit better next month does not mean that we will rapidly return to previous levels of&amp;nbsp;activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the equity indexes recovered during the day, with the Russell 2000 finishing 1% higher.
Treasuries were unchanged.
Nat Gas ended up 5.4%, gold 0.4%, oil (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTI&lt;/span&gt;) unchanged. 
Pretty much a re-run of all the down days we&amp;#8217;ve seen over the last six months.

&lt;h1&gt;Other&amp;nbsp;news&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; and other European countries seem to be facing more lockdowns.
Biden seems increasingly likely to be the next &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; president. Maybe Trump will end up in jail.
Twitter seems to have blocked Trumps account, albeit&amp;nbsp;briefly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="websites"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Unhedged, but not unhinged</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/unhedged-but-not-unhinged.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-10-14T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-10-14:/unhedged-but-not-unhinged.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Today&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today seemed very mixed. No clear direction. The market generally is all over the shop lately.
I think that the bond guys are generally smarter than the equity ones. 
The slope of the yield curve is a pretty good indicator of whether or not we&amp;#8217;re heading down the pan.
Late in the trading day, stocks slumped as Mnuchin seemed to say that his party and the Democrats were still far apart on a stimulus deal.
The constant drumbeat of stimulus, trade deal, vaccine hopes, Fed intervention, poll numbers is just noise, as far as I&amp;#8217;m concerned. But every announcement seems to produce a temporary spike (upwards or downwards) in equity markets.
Howard Marks made a comment that &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/13/howard-marks-says-the-current-market-offers-the-lowest-prospective-returns-in-history.html"&gt;markets were more overvalued than at any point in history&lt;/a&gt;. Nobody seems to&amp;nbsp;care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has not had any clear trend since the beginning of the official western reaction to the&amp;nbsp;pandemic:&lt;/p&gt;

How so much info can be assembled for no cost is beyond me, but I guess advertising to punters is worthwhile
I have a lot of anti-advertising tech in my browser, so maybe I&amp;#8217;m just not seeing what others see. I hope it doesn&amp;#8217;t turn into another seeking alpha (or motley&amp;nbsp;fool).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; is going parabolic again. 
It&amp;#8217;s hard to know why, but a big factor must be $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s reveal of its 5G phones.
Apple is an extraordinary company.
It is an object lesson in how good investor relations and marketing generally, and massive share buybacks, can totally neutralize Apple&amp;#8217;s failure to innovate technologically for the last thirteen&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Today&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4378720-what-cold-winter-entail-for-natural-gas-oh-you-dont-want-to-know"&gt;Another bullish article about natural gas&lt;/a&gt; has come onto my radar.
These days, it&amp;#8217;s so hard to avoid ending up in an echo chamber where everything we see confirms our priors that I am not sure if this is representative of the general view on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt;. It certainly hasn&amp;#8217;t has a strong trend recently.
My view is that as the cleanest standby fuel it&amp;#8217;s very complementary to wind and solar and so should be in high demand. The market doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to agree, and generally is marking down all conventional energy assets.
As a sector, energy has practically disappeared in terms of its weighting in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt;.
At some point I think it must come back, but the march of technology now seems unstoppable.
Just as it did in&amp;nbsp;1999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; seems to think that the risk-off tone of the markets was triggered by the nearness of the earnings season.
The only &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; equity market to be up is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; (what else?). Oil was up, but most everything else down in the commodity space. Global equity markets generally down. 
10 year govt. yields were &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt; globally, with the exception of Germany, which is quite odd on a risk off day, but consistent with a looming inflation risk&amp;nbsp;scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added a few &amp;#8216;interesting&amp;#8217; energy stocks into &lt;a href="https://www.unhedged.com/portfolio/5f857d11c370150010da7554/"&gt;a portfolio on unhedged&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ve only just started using unhedged, but it looks as though it has a lot of handy data. It seems to be good on 8-Ks and 10-Ks. I am not sure it has much macro&amp;nbsp;content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like Koyfin, but it does not seem to offer any ability to keep notes or see financials in a sensible layout.
I&amp;#8217;m sure both services have their value. The charting on Koyfin is&amp;nbsp;amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Sam&amp;nbsp;Brittan&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very sorry to read that Sam Brittan had passed away.
He became the first economics correspondent of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; in 1960.
You can see an article about him &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b763bf06-3fc2-4e95-9fe6-a17acf3d8f3b"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
I read a great deal by him, and it stimulated my subsequent interest in the subject.
He was a liberal, in the classical sense, as most people with an economics training tend to be. 
He sensibly wanted to avoid going into politics. I am sure he had a more benevolent effect on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; than his younger brother, who did go into politics and ended up in Mrs Thatcher&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that whatever the label people choose to attach to their political beliefs,
if they have any sort of exposure to economics as an academic subject they tend to agree with each other 
more than they disagree. 
I have always wondered why economics has never been a mainstream school subject, unlike music, art, geography or woodwork for&amp;nbsp;example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t realize that he was quite so shambolic in his dress and behaviour. 
He would not have made it today, where there is so much emphasis on looking good on&amp;nbsp;screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Macro&amp;nbsp;Corner&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyn Alden does some interesting historical trend&amp;nbsp;analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1299409793598337024/photo/1"&gt;this tweet&lt;/a&gt; for the background (sorry, Twitter makes it too difficult to hotlink&amp;nbsp;images).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chart seems to show that the money multiplier: the ratio of broad money to narrow money, but generally a measure of real money creation (by private banks) is spiking up, as it did in 1940. The result then was a rapid rise in prices (which had, in any case, been artificially repressed by rationing and price controls during the war years).
There was something of a spike, although much less pronounced in the 1970s.
The takeaway, as far as I can discern, is that inflation will finally take off.
However, the authorities talk up inflation, but the political realities of having higher inflation,
and therefore higher nominal interest rates, could be utterly catastrophic for government spending.
It is for this reason that I am not yet convinced that inflation will take off.
It&amp;#8217;s one thing to create (false) expectations of higher inflation.
It&amp;#8217;s quite another, as the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury, to cope with the financing consequences of such a thing.
Of course, over the longer run, a purging dose of inflation is precisely what a government wants to avoid paying the real cost of its borrowing. High nominal interest rates are often accompanied by negative real ones.
This has consequences for precious metals and the dollar,&amp;nbsp;obviously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the caption to the chart, Lyn Alden states that when the long term debt cycle has &amp;#8216;reached an apex&amp;#8217; (which, presumably, we have reached now, although there seems to be no pause in issuance), fiscal policy has to take over.
Central bankers around the globe have been calling for this for several years.
Presumably, the unstated implication is that the CBs are standing ready to monetize the spend. 
This, surely, is what will trigger inflation, not simply allowing private banks to swap long-dated Treasurys for reserves (which they refuse to lend&amp;nbsp;out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that an exploding monetary base does not translate into inflation.
&lt;a href="https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2019/08/switzerlands-mountainous-monetary-base/?utm_source=series_page&amp;amp;utm_medium=related_content&amp;amp;utm_term=related_resources&amp;amp;utm_campaign=fredblog"&gt;This blog post&lt;/a&gt; demonstrates that Switzerland has been growing the money base constantly and the last time I looked Switzerland didn&amp;#8217;t have a problem with inflation.
In fact, they are constantly buying &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; assets to try to keep their currency down to avoid it going through the roof, something that certainly would kill inflation stone&amp;nbsp;dead.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>New Week</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/new-week.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-10-12T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:42:47+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-10-12:/new-week.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Market&amp;nbsp;Open&lt;/h1&gt;

The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; had a chart for this year so far showing oil price (pretty flat) vs the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; energy sector ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;XLE&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Stock markets even less representative of the real economy than in the&amp;nbsp;past&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardly a surprise, as I am sure I&amp;#8217;ve noted before, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1315611971090296832"&gt;endorsed by Paul Krugman&lt;/a&gt;. Unsurprisingly, with the economy now dominated by services, which generally don&amp;#8217;t require a lot of capital investment, the capital markets (including the equity market) is less necessary.
It&amp;#8217;s been a long time since firms raised money to invest in physical capital on the stock market.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IPO&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s are much more likely to be about allowing early investors (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VC&lt;/span&gt;) to cash out (and, in the view of some, hand the paper to the&amp;nbsp;bagholders).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow commodities are all weak today. This note made at 2:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;33GMT&lt;/span&gt;. Maybe things will reverse later. 
Canada is shut, and it&amp;#8217;s Columbus Day in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, so markets may not be operating normally.
Equity markets seem reasonably bouncy, so this should be risk on.
Bonds, as usual, are not really giving any indication of&amp;nbsp;risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big move today was driven by a rapid drop in the oil price. 
A lot of production seems to be coming online. 
I think Libya production has restarted. 
Nobody on Twitter can work out what is happening. It looks increasingly as though Biden will win the election, and suddenly this is as positive for stocks as Trump winning the&amp;nbsp;election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Stock to look&amp;nbsp;at&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TEV&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CA&lt;/span&gt; was down a huge amount today (&amp;gt;10%). I saw some tweets to say that this has very postive free cashflow and a large part of the free float held by insiders, which would create the possibility of a short squeeze.
I know precisely nothing about this stock, so &lt;em&gt;do your research&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FANG&lt;/span&gt; stocks were up a huge amount today: $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt; over 6%.

&lt;p&gt;Commodities are up across the board, oil up &amp;gt;3%, gold up too.
All equity markets (that I can see) are green, and all sectors too.
Bond yields are imperceptibly lower. People are getting excited about a few bp increase in the 30-year yield. 
I think we should wait a bit before we conclude that an inflation inferno has definitively&amp;nbsp;started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Europe a backwater dominated by sectors in&amp;nbsp;decline&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The popular view amongst money managers is that European equities are dominated by sunset industries like energy, automobile manufacture and banking.  Graham Secker of Morgan Stanley believes differently. &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2d1d5704-c480-44dc-a705-53db67f9d0bb"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; points out&amp;nbsp;that &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In contrast, 45 per cent of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSCI&lt;/span&gt; Europe can be accounted for by healthcare, consumer staples and industrials — sectors that offer a healthy mix of good, quality growth. When we compare the sector mix of the European equity market to its global peers, these same three areas are those where Europe is most “overweight”, while its exposure to banks is no greater than that found in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSCI&lt;/span&gt; All Country World&amp;nbsp;Index.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the reality is that the out of fashion stocks have prices that have cratered so much that although a lot of employment and economic activity in Europe is still anchored by sunset industries, the stock market looks much more like that in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; than people realize. In fact, employment in the states is probably not so different. I am sure many more people work in coal mining there than work for Google, even though the mining sector&amp;#8217;s market cap is many orders of magnitude smaller. The stockmarket may have been closely linked to the real economy in the 1920s, but it certainly is not today, when actually making a profit will drag down a stock&amp;nbsp;price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Inflation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always seem to say something about inflation. Here is the chart for&amp;nbsp;today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="embed-container"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=wyw3&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/js/embed.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Fleck pointed out in his daily newsletter, Yamana Gold ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AUY&lt;/span&gt;) gained 6.5% on results, which might be a foretaste of what is to come with the bigger gold miners like Barrick ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GOLD&lt;/span&gt;). 
I am coming to prefer miners to the actual commodity, as they have a positive carry (admittedly $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GOLD&lt;/span&gt; yields only 0.73%, but on a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LTM&lt;/span&gt; basis it&amp;#8217;s P/E is nearly 11, which is pretty good for barbarous&amp;nbsp;relic).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Fed needs to spend&amp;nbsp;moooar&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Dizard &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ef1a7c4e-eb22-4cab-b699-929e520d3c8c"&gt;in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; argues that the Fed will have to start injecting large sums in to local governments in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;. I think he&amp;#8217;s probably right. 
The Fed will be hard pressed to refuse, for reasons he&amp;nbsp;lists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Dr Marc Faber explains in &lt;a href="https://ttmygh.podbean.com/e/teg_0008/"&gt;this podcast&lt;/a&gt;, once the Fed started &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE1&lt;/span&gt; there was no going back. 
The long term consequences will be bad (the least bad outcome is stagnating &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;, i.e. Japanification). 
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, with it&amp;#8217;s massive trade deficit, it&amp;#8217;s hard to see it being as painless as that.
The whole podcast is worth a listen (as is every one hosted by Grant Williams that I&amp;#8217;ve ever listened&amp;nbsp;to).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty much everything green except oil and Treasuries. Even nat. gas was up. 
Obviously, the denominator in all this is dollars, which were down: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; by 0.6%, which is a biggish&amp;nbsp;move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a good day for fraud stocks, with $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KODK&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSX&lt;/span&gt; both up &lt;em&gt;over 12%&lt;/em&gt;. If anything demonstrated why making money on a short-only fund was difficult, it&amp;#8217;s this.
Fintwit is furious, but nobody cares, as usual.

You can read some of his stuff &lt;a href="https://www.davidstockmanscontracorner.com/the-financialization-of-american-business-how-cheap-debt-fuels-the-bubble/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The basic problem is that with debt so much cheaper than equity, both because the central banks push down rates and because debt gets a favourable tax treatment. The result is a cratering of capital investment and a flood of debt issuance used to buy back shares. The latest developments are the worst&amp;nbsp;yet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://corporate.nordea.com/article/60553/fx-weekly-this-is-mmt-how-should-you-trade-it"&gt;Nordea research points out that we&amp;#8217;re already in a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; world&lt;/a&gt;. Bizarrely, Rishi Sunak is still talking about &amp;#8220;balancing the books&amp;#8221; for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. The only way this can happen is by dropping real value of the debt, and the only way to do this is to drop the real value of the currency. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBP&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; have to fall against real assets and probably against &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPY&lt;/span&gt; (probably &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHF&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

Markets went up. As&amp;nbsp;always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamala Harris &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Mike Pence had a dull debate.

I wouldn&amp;#8217;t write off the brute yet, but I hope he is beaten although if he wins it would be the best ever argument for quadratic&amp;nbsp;voting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A huge congressional report which concluded that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; stocks were abusing market power provoked a wide yawn from the stock market. It obviously thinks that the Dems need the donations too much to actually enact legislation with&amp;nbsp;teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna  finally got their Nobel Prize for their work on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRISPR&lt;/span&gt;-Cas9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Market&amp;nbsp;update&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities up globally.
Dollar down.
Commodities mixed: agricultural ones, down, metals up (except steel).
Yields up. 30-year (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;) Treasuries are looking as though they might just have a sniff of inflation.
Gilts are still up, as is the pound. I think at some point the day of reckoning will&amp;nbsp;arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with shorting stocks is that you&amp;#8217;re always vulnerable to a short squeeze.
Some absolute crap has seen strong growth lately, e.g. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BYND&lt;/span&gt;, up 150% &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YTD&lt;/span&gt;. 
The problem with shorting this stuff is that there&amp;#8217;s probably a tiny free float and it will always go parabolic as soon as you sell. 
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRM&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8212; Iron Mountain, a firm which makes money by collecting boxes of documents from big offices and storing it in big warehouses is up 3.6% today. Makes complete sense when nobody is working from home and all documents are sent and stored electronically for the last decade or&amp;nbsp;so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Evergrande Group, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EGRNY&lt;/span&gt; (a big China real estate group, which makes electric vehicles as a sideline, which is almost certainly going bankrupt, went up 17% today, on news that it had managed to get some deal with one of its creditors. It&amp;#8217;s probably not shortable, which is a great&amp;nbsp;relief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The options will have volatilities well north of 60%.
As Fleck says, you can&amp;#8217;t short individual stocks in a rising&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point in the future, it might be worth looking at &lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5e861759a5a3e4585269154a"&gt;this list&lt;/a&gt; of potential shorts.

&lt;p&gt;I have to feel relatively awake and able to concentrate, but when those conditions are fulfilled I like nothing better than to listen to an episode of &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/macro-musings"&gt;Macro Musings with David Beckworth&lt;/a&gt;. He&amp;#8217;s on the fairly obscure podcast app that I use, so yours will almost certainly work&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to two episodes&amp;nbsp;yesterday: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/macro-musings/megan-greene-and-eric-lonergan"&gt;Megan Greene and Eric Lonergan on Dual Interest Rates and the Prospects of Average Inflation Targeting&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/macro-musings/thorvald-grung-moe-on-the-life"&gt;Thorvald Grung Moe on the Life of Marriner Eccles and His Lasting Macroeconomic Legacy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both are excellent. The first explains how expanding the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TLTO&lt;/span&gt; facility could solve the issues of the zero lower bound and give monetary policy. It has an excellent discussion of how even eminent central bankers have a hazy idea of where to draw a line between monetary and fiscal policy. In my view, the major central banks have carried out policies with massive distributional consequences and are, as such up to their necks in fiscal policy. If a progressive income tax is a fiscal policy, then &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8212; which arguably has precisely the opposite distributional effect &amp;#8212; must also&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is a fascinating insight into a man who, without any academic training, came up with an intuitive understanding of macroeconomics that foreshadowed the work of Keynes and Minsky and, without even a degree (as far as I can tell) ended up not only becoming the chairman of the Fed but actually redesigned the Fed into the institution we know today. 
Minsky is sometimes mocked as an economist famous for having just one idea and promoting it endlessly (the &amp;#8220;Minsky moment&amp;#8221;). It&amp;#8217;s clear that he had some much more wide ranging ideas about how to stabilize an economy. I did read a long book by him once, but it was rather dense and I can understand why the general public prefers boiled down versions of his&amp;nbsp;ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Markets&amp;nbsp;Open&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mad tweeting from Trump seems to be having less impact on the market.
From what I can tell, he decided to backpedal on saying that he&amp;#8217;d block stimulus spending until after the election.
Currently (9:30 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;), most markets looking fairly rangebound, even&amp;nbsp;bitcoin!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart for the&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a president who promised to make &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; exports great again, he has conspicuously failed. Recessions usually hit domestic spending, which suppresses imports. This one seems very different, with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; taking a dive but consumers spending much less on (domestically produced) services and more on imports. I&amp;#8217;m surprised that Biden doesn&amp;#8217;t make more of this (in the 2008 crises the trade deficit shrank dramatically) but I guess that any mention of economics loses more votes than it gains, because it makes the candidate seem remote and out of touch with ordinary&amp;nbsp;voters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Long&amp;nbsp;ideas&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a great fan of &lt;a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/"&gt;Kuppy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s. A lot of his ideas crash and burn, but Dillards might be an exception. 
It&amp;#8217;s a department store stock. 
As he sort of says, why not just buy Macy&amp;#8217;s or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JC&lt;/span&gt; Penney? Well, you have to read &lt;a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2020/09/14/an-ed-trade-from-the-road/"&gt;the argument&lt;/a&gt;.
It&amp;#8217;s basically that $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DDS&lt;/span&gt; is going to experience a short squeeze.
I feel the market is in a precarious place go long something as unpromising as a retailer, but maybe a small exposure could be justified.
Neither I nor Kuppy can advise you on anything, especially trading&amp;nbsp;stocks.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="economics"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>K-shaped recovery</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/k-shaped-recovery.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-10-06T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-10-06:/k-shaped-recovery.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;K-shaped?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Covid recession started, people started wondering what the recovery would look like.
The recovery from the Global Financial Crisis in 2008 was horribly drawn out, and in fact &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; took longer to recover than it did in the Great Depression of the 1930s. How Bernanke, Yellen &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Co. can be so self-congratulatory for killing productivity growth so comprehensively has always baffled me, and probably always will.
The different scenarios were given a letter, so a V-shaped recovery was one where there was a single, steep leg down, followed by an equally steep leg up. An L-shaped one was one where the recovery was almost imperceptible (like the last one). Then I started seeing references to a K-shaped recovery. There are a number of interpretations, but this &lt;img src="https://i.redd.it/rzdwd5ec37q51.jpg" width=750&gt;  is&amp;nbsp;representative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More detail can be read in
&lt;a href="https://thereformedbroker.com/2020/10/05/whatever-comes-after-trump-and-biden-will-be-worse/"&gt;this note&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Dollar Bear&amp;nbsp;Case&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Roach explains &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/46b1a230-8c6c-4feb-b617-21a520cc201b"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; why the dollar is doomed. Certainly, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; is very unlike Japan in its savings behaviour and (therefore) its current account&amp;nbsp;evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="embed-container"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=wsLK&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/js/embed.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; economy is heading for deflation, one would expect the dollar to rally. 
The case for this derives from the collapse in velocity of money. This is the chart for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MZM&lt;/span&gt;, which is an improvement on M2 achieved by counting in money market funds (as far as I understand&amp;nbsp;it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="embed-container"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=wsMD&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/js/embed.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The corresponding chart for vanilla M2 is as follows. It does look rather alarming. It will probably spike quite a bit, as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; has been artifically depressed whereas the stock of money probably responds sluggishly to economic conditions: people are happy to see their current account return to credit for a&amp;nbsp;while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="embed-container"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=wmzz&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/js/embed.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Coal: where there&amp;#8217;s muck there&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;brass&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coal is such a hated asset now that $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTU&lt;/span&gt; is yielding over 13%. This means that if the company can keep paying out at that rate for seven or eight years,  even if it ends up with absolutely value as an operating entity,  it will have paid back the&amp;nbsp;investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; depends on coal for 30% of its electricity at the moment, and that is likely to continue for some&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the day ended quite risk off as Trump  tweets he has instructed his team to stop negotiating with Democrats over another relief package until after the&amp;nbsp;election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The polls suggest that Trump is toast. He&amp;#8217;s confounded the pollsters before, but surely he can&amp;#8217;t win this time (can&amp;nbsp;he??).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress seems finally to be waking up to the threat posed by the concentration in some markets. 
&lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/congress-should-consider-breaking-up-big-tech-and-limiting-acquisitions-11602015983?mod=article_inline"&gt;Here is the story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been reading Radical Markets by Weyl &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Posner. They make a very good case that the biggest block on growth is the pernicious influence of large portfolio managers on competition. 
You can read a bit about this &lt;a href="https://promarket.org/2018/05/03/glen-weyl-structure-capitalism-inherently-monopolistic/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; but I&amp;#8217;d recommend reading the book.

&lt;h1&gt;Best Economy&amp;nbsp;Ever&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politicians and central bankers love to tell us what a great job they&amp;#8217;ve done of managing the economy, how low inflation and unemployment rates are. They&amp;#8217;ve certainly done a great job of bloating the balance&amp;nbsp;sheet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="embed-container"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=wmRS&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/js/embed.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality is that, for men at least, the 1950s were a lot better in terms of their employment opportunities than they have been since. 
I think this may have something to do with the enduring level of support for Trump, who is, arguably, unashamedly misogynistic but whose comments resonate with older, less skilled workers who are the people who actually are out of work as a result of an influx of women into the workforce. 
The disruption of western economies as a result of women entering the workforce on a huge scale was largely welcomed by everyone, because nearly all men have a female relative who they respect and want to see do well economically. The economy has benefited enormously. But the losers have not been compensated, even though a generous compensation would be tiny compared to the&amp;nbsp;gains. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gold was down, again. Commodities were generally down, with the exception of copper, aluminium, wheat and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BDIY&lt;/span&gt;.
Sugar was flat, but is now up 18% over 3&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the exception of a couple of German yield curve points, no govt. bond yield curve is now inverted.
Even Japan shows a healthy slope.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; curve is exceptionally flat. 
Global corporate credit is getting more expensive, typically 20bp over the month. This can&amp;#8217;t go on for&amp;nbsp;ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPAC&lt;/span&gt; fever.

Currencies fairly flat.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange had more network problems which stopped trading.
PMs up, but energy down.
Sugar showing some life: up 4%.
Commodities are having a weird year: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YTD&lt;/span&gt; crude is down 40% but the Baltic Dry Index (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BDI&lt;/span&gt;) is up 72%

Commodities mixed to negative.
Gold was up a bit, so was oil.
The dollar (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt;) was down a bit after a strongish run last week.
All &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; sectors were up.

Most international equities were down, apart from inflation-prone places like Mexico and Turkey.
I feel that the weakness of currency is the biggest weakness of my general bearishness on developed markets equities.
The dollar rallied 1.8% to a two-month high. 
The argument for a drop is the terrible twin deficits (and weak savings, but that&amp;#8217;s implied).
The argument for a continued rally is the Fed&amp;#8217;s action being taken as a template for every other &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CB&lt;/span&gt; on the&amp;nbsp;planet.&lt;/p&gt;

There is a lot of other data in this article from the Economist.
Yes, I too felt that I&amp;#8217;d already reached my lifetime budget of exposure to articles about Covid, but this one might justify going an extra few&amp;nbsp;pages.&lt;/p&gt;

Wolf Street is not an unbiased source, but tries to look a bit more deeply into specific areas than most news outlets. 
Unemployment is clearly going to be huge, after the stimulus programmes run out. 
It&amp;#8217;s a pity that measuring it is so difficult. It&amp;#8217;s an elusive number, because it&amp;#8217;s definition requires people to be willing and able to work. How do you actually measure someone&amp;#8217;s willingness to&amp;nbsp;work? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;India&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narenda Modi seems to be turning into a sub-continental Trump. 
This can&amp;#8217;t be good for the Indian economy, or stock market.
It&amp;#8217;s not a big market, but I feel bearish about it.
No charts or hard data, just a few crumbs of sentiment I&amp;#8217;ve picked&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;

Bonds were basically flat, apart from converts, which are really equity.
Currencies flat (bitcoin up 1% vs &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;).
Emerging markets mixed, India up 2.1%, China down 1%. 
Evergrande looking hammered, after bonds stopped trading. 
It&amp;#8217;s expected that the PBoC will bail them out, or the government.

The collapse in everything priced in dollars has slowed correspondingly.
A few commodities have showed signs of life, but silver seems to continue to collapse.
I had had a good run.
Japanese and European equities rallied modestly, but not convincingly.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MXEA&lt;/span&gt; futures point to a feeble rally, as does&amp;nbsp;bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Kent secedes from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Not really.)
The lack of readiness for customs checks at Dover seems to have forced the government to a somewhat hare-brained scheme of forcing these checks out beyond the borders of Kent.
I have no idea how this will work.
My guess is that it won&amp;#8217;t be as bad as the media are predicting, but that would suggest that the government are good at something (managing expectations), for which there is not a great deal of&amp;nbsp;evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Farm&amp;nbsp;subsidies&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/09/22/who-got-the-33-billion-in-farm-subsidies-for-the-us-china-trade-war-and-coronavirus-payments/"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; suggests that those receiving farm subsidies are not the most deserving. 
It falls into the &amp;#8220;dog bites man&amp;#8221; category of news stories that provokes a barely stifled yawn from readers.
Of course farm subsides are not designed to help farmers. Their principle purpose is to tilt the result of elections. The same goes for most taxes and subsidies, but farm subsidies are particularly egregious, because of the way they help to cement a grotesquely non-optimal allocation of&amp;nbsp;capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How to get rich&amp;nbsp;quick&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/09/23/robinhood-traders-trigger-massive-idiocy-on-scheme-by-nasdaq-listed-chinese-penny-stock-spi-energy-that-skyrocketed-4387-collapsed-by-two-thirds-in-just-one-day/"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; it is explained that you have a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASDAQ&lt;/span&gt; listing, as a penny stock, and you put out a press release telling investors that you plan to become the next Nikola (which was the next Tesla). Your stock rockets up by a factor of 44, but then crashes down to earth just as quickly. Selling at the top must take some nerves of&amp;nbsp;steel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day finished in fairly clear risk on territory, although equity markets are still down over a week. 
As usual large growth led the charge.
Commodities were generally stronger, as the dollar weakned a tad.
Bitcoin jumped 5%. Natural Gas leaped. I read that Nordstrom 2 is going ahead. Not sure how that impacts &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt; pricing.
Soft commods are complicated beasts: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GoddessofGrain"&gt;Angie Setzer&lt;/a&gt; is worth a follow.
Copper is weak. Always a worry.
Silver is behaving very&amp;nbsp;oddly: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZwCUaEav18&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;The Market Huddle interviewed Brent Kochuba about gamma and how it interacted with the cash market last month&lt;/a&gt;. I listened to this while doing something which required more concentration than was compatible with understanding every nuance of what Brent and Kevin were discussing, but the takeaway I ended up with was that it&amp;#8217;s quite possible that Softbank was just hedging some of its existing positions in the mega cap tech stocks. The logical conclusion was that if it wasn&amp;#8217;t Softbank, it must have been the armies of RobinHood&amp;nbsp;traders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many players, now, trading in individual stock options and index options, and there is such a range of possibilities of interactions between these markets and the underlyings that it&amp;#8217;s very hard to attribute market moves to option buying and selling. It&amp;#8217;s interesting to speculate, though, and I&amp;#8217;d bet that the increased use of derivatives by &amp;#8216;amateur&amp;#8217; traders is likely to create extra volatility,&amp;nbsp;ultimately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was very interesting to listen to the Huddle&amp;#8217;s discussion of what the option market makers have to do to hedge their risk after writing big option positions with (e.g.) Softbank as the counterparty, especially about the limits to delta hedging which is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; in a textbook but does rely on some heroic and unrealistic&amp;nbsp;assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Opening&amp;nbsp;notes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the markets bounced back, a bit, from their extremes of yesterday.
There is still a lingering smell of risk-off, and bitcoin is down a bit, and T-bonds flat.
Gold is well off its lows (1886) but still far from its high of 2080 in early August.
The dollar is still strong: even now it is a safe haven from volatile securities&amp;nbsp;markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;News&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so called &amp;#8220;FinCEN files&amp;#8221; leak has indicated that the usual suspects have been involved in money laundering.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HSBC&lt;/span&gt;, Barclays, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPM&lt;/span&gt;, Deutsche, StanChart all are fingered. 
It doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to have made any difference to their share prices: I don&amp;#8217;t suppose anybody was surprised, or cares very much. Stanchart share price was up 1.3% today, as of 11:47 as I write this.
For the group that did the work, take a look &lt;a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/mining-sars-data/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities regained some of their lost ground, lead by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASDAQ&lt;/span&gt; (of course).
Commodities were practically flat, as were govt. bonds.
Bitcoin &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; the Euro were down, Yen up. 
All the sectors were up apart from healthcare (slightly), financials and energy.
Silver and silver miners were up, a bit.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; seems to have failed to get a bounce from battery day, although I don&amp;#8217;t know why.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; ran a rather gushing piece on how Tesla has revolutionized car manufacturing by being vertically integrated,
as though this wasn&amp;#8217;t something that Henry Ford wasn&amp;#8217;t doing well over a hundred years ago.
Supposedly, software works better if all the drivetrain is manufactured in house.
I am not, unsurprisingly,&amp;nbsp;convinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Latex&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tex is an amazing piece of software.
I have recently been using xelatex (and pdflatex &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; lualatex), driven via pandoc, to convert markdown to pdf.
The whole thing is controlled from a makefile.
It&amp;#8217;s probably not going to knock &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MS&lt;/span&gt; Word off its perch, but it&amp;#8217;s really very easy to use, once you have got a basic

Gold is down, along with other metals and soft commodities. Crude is down 2.3%.
Lagarde is trying to talk the Euro down.
It&amp;#8217;s certainly going up against the Turkish Lira, which may be about to implode.
Tech is holding up relatively well, but only now $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt; has already declined&amp;nbsp;20%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trevor Milton, of Nikola was forced out earlier. The stock is down 50% but some banks still rate it as worth&amp;nbsp;something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to see this being a risk-off Monday, but the trend has been very strong, and I&amp;#8217;m sure the Plunge Protection Team are standing&amp;nbsp;by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Coins in the fuse&amp;nbsp;box&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had never before heard this metaphor, but Greenspan used it to explain the role of the Fed in the Great Depression.
&lt;a href="http://creditbubblebulletin.blogspot.com/2020/09/weekly-commentary-revisiting-coin-in.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FvOLVyH+%28++Credit+Bubble+Bulletin%29"&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CBB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has a great article about why this time isn&amp;#8217;t different.
It&amp;#8217;s the same stuff about the Fed acting irresponsibly, and not being able to stop inflation when it gets to 2%.
The Bulletin is nothing if not consistent, but has a lot of good factual content&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conspiracy theory&amp;nbsp;spot&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitney Webb, who is a bit mad, is convinced that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNC&lt;/span&gt; fixed it for Kamala Harris to become president, in spite of not doing very well in the primaries, by putting Biden in as a shield for her, until he stands down immediately after the election. If it all seems a bit far fetched, it is. But I think we should be allowed to make our own minds up, so I commend to you &lt;a href="https://quoththeraven.podbean.com/e/quoth-the-raven-222-whitney-webb-talks-2020-election-chaos/"&gt;this episode&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QTR&lt;/span&gt; podcast, to hear from the lady herself.
She does not &lt;em&gt;sound&lt;/em&gt; like a mad conspiracy theorist, but that may say more about my assumptions than objective&amp;nbsp;reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does not seem very radical to suggest that this presidential election is exceptionally polarizing, or that Biden is not obviously the most electable of the main candidates in the Democrat primaries. The increased risk shows up in the term structure of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets were looking rough, but the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; finished green (as it always does on a Monday), so everything is good.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; was up a lot (+1.93), though, and govts. were up.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; was down&amp;nbsp;3.7%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities were down a lot, Silver nearly 8% and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt; 10.3%. 
Gold was down nearly 2%. 
This was, presumably, driven by a surge in the dollar, e.g. the Euro ending down 0.64% against&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="monetary policy"></category></entry><entry><title>19 Sept Weekend Wrap</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/19-sept-weekend-wrap.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-09-19T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-09-19:/19-sept-weekend-wrap.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RBG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NKLA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mainstream media seem to be waking up to the fact that Nikola is a fraud, after @nikloatrevor admitted that a video of their prototype had no engine but was just rolling down a hill like a physics experiment involving a frictionless block on an inclined plane.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TESLAQ&lt;/span&gt;  crowd have known that $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NKLA&lt;/span&gt; was a fraud stock for years, but nobody ever paid attention to them.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NKLA&lt;/span&gt; worth more than $F&amp;nbsp;(Ford).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Tik&amp;nbsp;Tok&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a huge fuss over who will pick up the carcass of this short video app. Trump probably spends more time on it than on bringing peace to the Middle East (on the other hand, maybe that&amp;#8217;s an already solved problem).
I installed the app and understand that it delivers a quick thrill to the users, and can be a cheap way for &amp;#8216;models&amp;#8217; to promote their Only Fans pages, but really, does it have any meaningful competitive edge over (e.g.) Facebook bringing out a clone&amp;nbsp;app?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Week&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe sectors for the week: winners were retail, health and mining. Losers were banks, autos and oil and&amp;nbsp;gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; sectors for the week: winners were  energy, industrials, materials and health care; losers were the rest, especially consumer discretionary and communications services. Oddly, real estate was about flat.
Energy has had an &lt;em&gt;annus horribilis&lt;/em&gt;: the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSCI&lt;/span&gt; Energy Index is down&amp;nbsp;55%.&lt;/p&gt;

This has to be pretty negative for Lloyds and&amp;nbsp;Natwest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AUD&lt;/span&gt; the new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHF&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monetary easing is probably going to continue, which logically is negative for the dollar.
But all the other countries are easing like maniacs too.
My bet is that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AUD&lt;/span&gt; is a better bet than &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHF&lt;/span&gt;. It has gold, not in vaults, but in yet to be exploited gold reserves.
It has a much lower debt than most countries, and it is a fully functioning democracy which doesn&amp;#8217;t spend huge sums on defence.
It even has a relatively young population.
I&amp;#8217;m guessing about the factors, so do your own&amp;nbsp;research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Commodities and&amp;nbsp;inflation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think commodities are cheap relative to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBP&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-09-15/fed-wants-inflation-japan-points-to-easy-money-limits?sref=uN6cur8D"&gt;So does John Authers&lt;/a&gt;. 
I&amp;#8217;m a bit worried about this: whenever Authers says something I agree with, the market takes the opposing view.
It is particularly interesting to see &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; inflation looking as though it&amp;#8217;s about to take off.
The traditional method of profiting from this would be to sell gilts, but maybe buying a commodity index (future) and selling &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBP&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; to hedge the dollar exposure would be more reliable given that the Bank of England is likely to be rigging the gilts market for some decades to&amp;nbsp;come.&lt;/p&gt;

As we get old, our bodies wear out. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; spends 80% of its budget treating people who will be dead within a couple of years.
As we get old, we become incapable of looking after ourselves,
we become immobile and in need of &amp;#8216;personal care.&amp;#8217;
Of course, many of us die in the prime of life, and have no need for the indignity of &amp;#8216;toileting.&amp;#8217;
But the rest do, and it is expensive, and we have no money left over to pay for it. 
A civilized society cannot allow its oldest members to die of&amp;nbsp;neglect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; government tries to make a clear distinction between medical care and personal care.
But this is an arbitrary distinction, which makes those  that fall on the wrong (expensive) side of it very unhappy.
Insurance seems the obvious solution, as it will allow us to  pool the risk, but  when society cannot bear the pain of 
an uninsured person suffering, the cost&amp;nbsp;explodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current situation is untenable, although it has endured for a long time.
Eventually, some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; style solution will be adopted.
Families will have a reduced role in caring for their oldest members, which is a real cost.
But those members will have a comfortable senesence. 
It&amp;#8217;s not an ideal tradeoff, but it&amp;#8217;s probably the least bad which is&amp;nbsp;achievable.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico fail to disturb markets</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/hurricanes-in-the-gulf-of-mexico-fail-to-disturb-markets.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-09-17T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:42:47+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-09-17:/hurricanes-in-the-gulf-of-mexico-fail-to-disturb-markets.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Market&amp;nbsp;update&lt;/h1&gt;

The energy complex is up on some refinery capacity being taken out (and, I think, the reserve being lower than full).
The exception is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt;, which is down, but only after a stonking run.
Convertibles are up. I read in the paper that convertible arbitrage is now a game worth playing for hedge funds after years of no interest. 
The article implied that the driver was increased equity vol, but that&amp;#8217;s not obviously the case in the main market.
I guess the third division companies that issue convertibles might have experienced some high vol. lately.
I took a look a longer chart for gold. It is supernaturally flat: down 7bp in the last month, with very little intervening volatility. It is as if it&amp;#8217;s tracking interest&amp;nbsp;rates&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a subscriber to Shadow Government Stats, but &lt;a href="http://www.shadowstats.com/article/csbf1449"&gt;it&amp;#8217;s latest report&lt;/a&gt; strongly suggests that the policy announced at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOMC&lt;/span&gt; meeting will result in an inflation spike. 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; does not believe that government spending can be financed by money printing without limit. 
Practitioners have always stated that &lt;em&gt;once the spending has started bring the economy near to its production frontier then it&amp;#8217;s appropriate to drain demand via tax rises to control inflation&lt;/em&gt;. 
I don&amp;#8217;t think that we&amp;#8217;ve quite reached &amp;#8220;Mainstream &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; but we&amp;#8217;re getting damn close to it with the latest announcement, and it&amp;#8217;s hard to see Biden moving swiftly to raise taxes, especially three years into his term.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, maybe I meant Kamala doing something that would stop her becoming the first elected (black) woman &lt;span class="caps"&gt;POTUS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;) Monetary Policy Committee meeting today.
The Economist expects no change of policy, which sets the Bank of England alongside virtually every central bank on the planet.
&lt;em&gt;At some point&lt;/em&gt; rates will have to rise but it doesn&amp;#8217;t seem that it&amp;#8217;s going to happen any time&amp;nbsp;soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Micro&amp;nbsp;futures&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/education/courses/micro-e-mini-futures/micro-e-mini-futures-products-overview.html"&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CME&lt;/span&gt; is launching micro contracts in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DJI&lt;/span&gt;, Nasdaq, Russell 2000 and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
This is to fight back against RobinHood, presumably, which must be draining some commission income from the&amp;nbsp;exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Alibaba cloud&amp;nbsp;computer&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/Alibaba-targets-cloud-market-with-China-s-answer-to-Chromebook"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; sounds interesting, but the article is devoid of any practical details of the&amp;nbsp;device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;liquidity&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://thedailyshot.com/wp-content/uploads/EQ-Liq-ESA0916043024.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This indicates a lack of both buyers and sellers of the future. 
Maybe they&amp;#8217;ve moved to the micro version, or they just can&amp;#8217;t tolerate the volatility and lack of direction.
Liquidity is an odd concept: it&amp;#8217;s the confidence that one can have that there are willing buyers and sellers for an asset &lt;em&gt;under the full range of future states of the market&lt;/em&gt;. It is not simply that &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; there are lots of buyers and sellers. As someone once said, it&amp;#8217;s hard to define but you&amp;#8217;ll know what it is when you haven&amp;#8217;t got&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Commodities&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My old thinking about inflation was that the way to profit from unanticipated price escalation was to short long-dated government bonds.
The problem with this strategy is that this is a rigged market: the counterparty is a central bank someone that can keep buying longer than you can remain solvent.
It may be possible to buy inflation linked bonds, but these are already extremely expensive.
It occurred to me that commodities may be an alternative route.
Of course, commodities can be very volatile for short-term &amp;#8216;technical&amp;#8217; factors, e.g. arising from supply holdups, bad weather etc.
But cheap exposure can be obtained via futures (don&amp;#8217;t do this at home!) or ETFs. 
As always, this is a recommendation to do some research, not to trade. But looking into this seems worthwhile at the moment.
I follow &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/author/andrew-hecht"&gt;Andrew Hecht&lt;/a&gt;. He is almost a perma-bull, but he writes interesting&amp;nbsp;stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The End&amp;nbsp;Game&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to (most) of &lt;a href="https://ttmygh.podbean.com/e/teg_0007/"&gt;Episode 7&lt;/a&gt; of this podcast.
The amazing thing about this is that all the guests agree that the current financialization of everything is going to end in tears, but none really have a clear idea of what the end will look like.
One thing that everyone seems to agree about is that as financial assets grow without any limit,
no &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CB&lt;/span&gt; can ever let interest rates go up.
The big question is whether they will stay at zero or will go downwards forever.
My bet is that they are pushed down into deep negative territory, 
but this will have a big impact on the value of movable assets (such as collectable&amp;nbsp;coins).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/schools-brief/2020/09/12/governments-can-borrow-more-than-was-once-believed"&gt;This is a &amp;#8216;Schools Brief&amp;#8217; about the phenomenon of increasing government debt&lt;/a&gt;.
I think it&amp;#8217;s fairly uncontroversial, although it points out that although returns on investment in the private sector appear to be high, relative to government investment, there are very low levels of physical capital formation in the private sector.
Although the article does not spend much time exploring this anomaly, I suspect that one of the two suggested explanations is right: that high returns to corporates is largely the result of monopoly profits, also known as economic rents. 
The conclusion is rather tepid: governments can, and should do more deficit spending, they should be careful what they spend the money on and they should &amp;#8220;prepare for the possibility of an eventual change in the global interest-rate environment.&amp;#8221; The fact is, that increasing borrowing now is doing the opposite of preparing for an increase in real interest rates, and it&amp;#8217;s hard to see any other actions that governments can take to offset&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/09/15/why-the-hoped-for-solution-to-out-of-control-government-debts-wont-work-this-time/"&gt;Some people&lt;/a&gt; think this is a huge problem, but the insanely cheap long-dated puts on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ED&lt;/span&gt; futures shows that the markets are intensely relaxed about the&amp;nbsp;possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a J Powell presser today. 
From the random remarks on Twitter I saw, it seems that Powell said that they were going to keep rates low for as long as it takes, but certainly for three years [check!].
Equities went down a bit, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NQ&lt;/span&gt; more than most. 
Govt. bonds went down too. Quite an achievement.
Commodities generally up, gold flat.
Strangely, bitcoin was up quite a bit, which may indicate that risk on may be back tomorrow.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; was up too, as was the pound, quite a bit but reversing its moves last week.

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Politics&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look on with a mix of fascination and horror at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; presidential election. The campaign as about as far from the conventional meaning of &amp;#8220;presidential&amp;#8221; as could be imagined.
It&amp;#8217;s no an original thought, but I see the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; electing Trump again, for the reason they voted for Brexit and that they elected the Conservatives here. Not because they think the candidate is smarter, or less corrupt or even more competent, but because he can be relied upon to deliver populist policies in the teeth of advice from the establishment not&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What seems clear is that if Biden wins, the dollar will go down. My instinct is that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; stocks will go up in this case, but there are a lot of moving parts. What is very odd is that volatility is so low, for all securities. Incredibly, Eurodollar futures (&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the eurocurrency future, which is effectively a forward &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt; price) are trading at an implied vol of 0.2% at the short end, going up to a dizzy 0.5% a few years out. It has never been as cheap as this to take a protected bet on short-term &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; rates&amp;nbsp;rising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://tme1.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/4bf7b78dfb6837d5782c044d430833b5" width=700&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you didn&amp;#8217;t believe me when I said that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; stock prices were heavily influenced by the dollar, take a look at this&amp;nbsp;chart:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://tme2.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/6530b9d8c66ce27239d0a2af6f80ab17" width=700&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Crowded&amp;nbsp;trades&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess is that the most crowded trades&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long tech ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;QQQ&lt;/span&gt;),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;short dollar ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;futures),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long&amp;nbsp;gold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These seem overextended to me (especially tech). There is a lot of momentum in these, and huge weight of reserve buyers/sellers, but once the markets turn decisively there will be a lot of unwinding to&amp;nbsp;do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;#8220;tail risks&amp;#8221; are presumably biological (Covid), political (Biden) and economic (inflation, stagflation,&amp;nbsp;unemployment).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities, energy, metals, crypto up. 
Vol, grains down.
Currencies, bonds flat.

&lt;h1&gt;Weekly&amp;nbsp;wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities down quite heavily: 3.2% for the Russell and the same for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt;. 
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; is down double that, and the drop seems to be accelerating, although on Monday the direction might change violently. Almost incredibly, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; is down 14% over the week, to close to 20% (which is still high in terms of realized vol.). My understanding is that there has been a ton of call buying by retail which is (presumably) unwinding or expiring, creating a downward pressure on vols, but this is wild speculation on my&amp;nbsp;part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the sectors, energy continues to get hammered. Presumably, this is transport (and particularly air travel) related. I feel that there is value in energy (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;XOM&lt;/span&gt; yields 9%!), but downward momentum is hard to shake&amp;nbsp;off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World equity markets have been relatively flat, apart from Europe, which has been surprisingly perky.
In spite of the never ending omnishambles that is Brexit, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTSE&lt;/span&gt; has done pretty well, up 4% on the week, presumably because of the tailwind provided by the weak&amp;nbsp;pound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long and short term risk free rates have remained largely unchanged, with the same true for investment and low grade credit. Convertibles are down, as you&amp;#8217;d expect given their&amp;nbsp;seniority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities are down apart from corn, cotton and cattle (and soybeans). Wheat is down, but from a recent strong run.
Gold is fractionally up, but nothing else. Silver is still sliding down from it&amp;#8217;s amazing&amp;nbsp;run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; currencies held up fairly well (commodities related?).
The pound is sinking, as it has a chronic trade deficit which can only get bigger.
The Euro, which spiked against the dollar when Lagarde didn&amp;#8217;t cover herself in glory at an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt; event, has slumped back to where it was. 
I am not a connoiseur of these things but I saw a commentator say something to the effect of &amp;#8220;I never thought I&amp;#8217;d say this, but now I long for the time that Mario Draghi did these things.&amp;#8221; 
One of these days they&amp;#8217;ll actually let an actual banker run the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt;. 
Well, maybe not this&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morris Sachs, interviewed on the Market Huddle made a few good&amp;nbsp;points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gold is a commodity, but trades a vol which is very low for a commodity (more like a currency). This makes calls&amp;nbsp;attractive,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the yield curve is flat, with negative real rates going out for a long way, which makes forward prices cheap (off which all options are&amp;nbsp;priced),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gold is under-held by most&amp;nbsp;institutions,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gold may have a role in evading estate taxes (I don&amp;#8217;t fully understand this as it&amp;#8217;s a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;-tax thing, but it may be a&amp;nbsp;factor),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&amp;#8217;s a &amp;#8220;story&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;stock,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&amp;#8217;s no longer overbought (because it&amp;#8217;s been flat for a&amp;nbsp;while),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the dollar &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; go down (there is a lot of M2 creation), but it&amp;#8217;s hard to see which alt. currency to trade against, since all &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CB&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s are following the Fed&amp;#8217;s lead (possible exception is China, but that is a difficult currency to&amp;nbsp;trade).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that the conclusion from all this is to go long via long-dated options, maybe on $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GLD&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;South Sea&amp;nbsp;Bubble&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three hundred years ago the South Sea Company failed. 
The story is well worth reading: most of the important points are found in Wikipedia, but it&amp;#8217;s entertaining to listen to Patrick Cerezna talking about it in the Market Huddle, mentioned above.
The &amp;#8220;story&amp;#8221; of the stock was that the company had been granted a monopoly of trade with south America, and would, in time, come to exceed even the East India Company in terms of profits.
The govt. was happy, because the company took over the national debt, and the granting of &amp;#8220;golden shares&amp;#8221; to insiders and regulators ensured that there would be no close scrutiny of its operation.
The company was the original Public Private Partnership. Its failure lead to the creation of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_Act"&gt;the Bubble Act&lt;/a&gt; which made it very difficult to create joint stock companies which resulted in very few being created until the advent of the Industrial Revolution and the numerous joint stock companies set up to finance railway building in Britain and abroad (I think there were some created to finance the digging of canals, but the issue of vast numbers of railway shares was the big&amp;nbsp;event). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4a439398-88ab-442a-9927-e743a3ff609b"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; explains how RobinHood is able to offer retail investors commission-free stock trading. &lt;a href="https://www.tradersmagazine.com/am/the-hidden-costs-of-robinhood/"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; goes a bit further in suggesting that RobinHood is not really in the business of stealing from the rich to give to the poor, at least if you think of &amp;#8220;the poor&amp;#8221; as RobinHoods notional&amp;nbsp;customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost the nearest thing that economics has to the Second Law of Thermodynamics is &lt;em&gt;There ain&amp;#8217;t no such thing as a free lunch&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TANSTAAFL&lt;/span&gt; for short. 
In the case of RobinHood, as in the case of Facebook, the product is the &amp;#8220;user.&amp;#8221; The real customer is Citadel Securities, which gets to see the retail order flow and is free to write &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt; algorithms to monetize it or to &amp;#8220;front run&amp;#8221; it as we used to say in the good old days.
Of course, Citadel and the others who pay &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RH&lt;/span&gt; for order flow do not literally examine orders and place orders ahead of them. They simply use the real time data on where those leading the herd of retail investors are veering to next to make sure that they are on the right side of the&amp;nbsp;trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telsa, recently jilted at the altar by the committee of the S&amp;amp;P500 inclusion committee is another case where the customer is seen and unseen. In Tesla&amp;#8217;s case, a large part of its revenue is from companies like Fiat Chrysler Automotive, which does not make BEVs itself, but needs to include some in its notional product mix to satisfy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; regulators. By counting some Tesla cars as if they were made by Fiat, the latter gets off paying fines to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;. 
In Tesla&amp;#8217;s case, this is problematic, as these lucrative customers are about to go away, as every automotive manufacturer in Europe is churning out its own &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BEV&lt;/span&gt; range. This is all speculative, as the committee does not give its reasons. Tesla can now raise insanely cheap capital, so it has a big competitive advantage over legacy auto makers and might yet get in the index without opaque tax arbitrage payments from other automakers. We&amp;#8217;ll&amp;nbsp;see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Morning&amp;nbsp;call&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities have calmed down after the euphoric bounce yesterday.
Bonds are dead.
Commodities are mixed but fairly flat.
Bitcoin ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BRR&lt;/span&gt; futures) is drifting down. I don&amp;#8217;t see bitcoin as having any intrinsic value, 
but this makes its price a perfect measure of global sentiment. With no fundamentals to worry about, 
no yield to link its price to the movement of future interest rates, 
no trade balances or central bank issuance to worry about, it really has the characteristics of a perfect indicator.
With any luck it&amp;#8217;ll be a leading indicator, although the &amp;#8220;craze&amp;#8221; aspect of it would not have helped in its early days. Hopefully, now, there is no novelty in bitcoin: it&amp;#8217;s just a tradable commodity (albeit digital) that just reflects investor&amp;#8217;s appetite for risk.
You can see it here, when I get around to finding an embeddable chart for&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Worth a&amp;nbsp;look&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/09/09/have-you-noticed-how-push-back-against-powell-feds-actions-is-getting-louder-in-the-mainstream-media-from-npr-to-cnbc/"&gt;Wolf on how J Powell responds to critics who say he&amp;#8217;s exacerbating inequality&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTW&lt;/span&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s perfectly possible for the Fed&amp;#8217;s actions to increase the chance of deflation and inflation, at the same time. The future of the economy has a distribution of outcomes, and more matters than just the mean (or the&amp;nbsp;median!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Druckenmiller&amp;nbsp;says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s an &amp;#8220;absolute raging mania.&amp;#8221; Hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller appeared on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNBC&lt;/span&gt; yesterday, warning of the mania in the markets caused by the Federal Reserve and saying it will end badly. &amp;#8220;Everybody loves a party &amp;#8230; but, inevitably, after a big party there&amp;#8217;s a hangover,&amp;#8221; Druckenmiller said. &amp;#8220;Right now, we&amp;#8217;re in an absolute raging mania. We&amp;#8217;ve got commentators encouraging companies to do stock splits. Companies then go up 50%, 30%, 40% on stock splits. That brings no value, but the stocks go&amp;nbsp;up.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Druckenmiller also said, as reported by Bloomberg and printed in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inflation could hit 5% to 10% in the next four to five years, Druckenmiller said Wednesday in a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNBC&lt;/span&gt; interview, adding that the Federal Reserve has created conditions that have sent valuations soaring. Deflation is also a risk, he&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do we do about this? I wish I knew. It sounds as though Druck doesn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Current&amp;nbsp;Account&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This looks awkward for Trump, given his trade wars&amp;nbsp;rhetoric. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class='embed-container'&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written early, but so far the market looks becalmed. 
Equities practically flat, other markets fairly quiet. 
Not entirely consistent with the Druck quote above, but this thing is not over&amp;nbsp;yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written as the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; closed: quite severe drops in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBP&lt;/span&gt;. The latter because of the Brexit omnishambles, 
presumably.
Nearly all commodities down (wheat an exception, maybe).
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; currencies down. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; up (of course).
Looks like a classic risk off day, except 10 year treasuries are not responding. 
We truly are turning&amp;nbsp;Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Worth listening&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://macromusings.libsyn.com/george-selgin-on-average-inflation-targeting-and-the-menace-of-fiscal-qe"&gt;George Selgin appeared on &amp;#8220;Macro Musings&amp;#8221; podcast again.&lt;/a&gt;
Some of this stuff is very technical (too technical for me!) but the takeaway I got from listening to the podcast was that J Powell was not going to let any Taylor type rule bind his hands. The weasel words he used in the Average Inflation Targeting suggested that he would retain a huge amount of discretionary control over policy.
That&amp;#8217;s the problem with fixed rules for policy formation. The economic arguments for them may be compelling, but the humans whose power is threatened by adopting them are the same humans who have the power to veto (or cripple)&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The podcast is mainly Selgin talking about his book, &lt;em&gt;The Menace of Fiscal &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Chart for the&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, the evening news on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; would often lead with the latest figures for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; current account deficit.
This was probably a legacy of Wilson&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;pound in your pocket&amp;#8221; devaluation of 1964.
Dominic Harrod, son of Roy Harrod the famous economist, would solemnly intone the latest figures, which seemed always to be implicitly&amp;nbsp;bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, we never had it so good. We&amp;#8217;re heading for a deficit of &amp;pound;100e9 at the current rate. 
It&amp;#8217;s only the weakness of the dollar and the money creation of the Fed that is keeping the pound where it&amp;nbsp;is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=vpUi&amp;width=750&amp;height=600" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"style="overflow:hidden; width:750px; height:650px;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Can central banks actually create&amp;nbsp;money?&lt;/h1&gt;

Money creation is endogenous. 
Money is created when there are profitable opportunities for commercial banks to make profitable loans.
There may be none, so money creation might crash, along with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;, which will push inflation down to zero.
Banking is a funny business, and there is a lot of misunderstanding about the role of commercial and central banks,
but I think that this piece goes some way to explaining how the system really works, rather than how the central bankers pretend (or maybe even believe) it&amp;nbsp;works.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Velocity of money taking a dive, same as markets</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/velocity-of-money-taking-a-dive-same-as-markets.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-09-08T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-09-08:/velocity-of-money-taking-a-dive-same-as-markets.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Velocity Drops&amp;nbsp;Precipitously&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Markets&amp;nbsp;today&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity markets are spooked, volumes are quite high. No actual panic, yet. 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; main market by 1.4 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SD&lt;/span&gt;. Others much less.
It&amp;#8217;s not really clear why: presumably all the reasons why the market should have gone down in the past but didn&amp;#8217;t.
Yields are up everywhere, except Germany, which is odd.
Commodities are down, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CL1&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTI&lt;/span&gt; intermediate near future) fairly&amp;nbsp;spectacularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of &amp;#8216;near $TSLAs&amp;#8217; coming up to take its place: $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NKLA&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIO&lt;/span&gt;. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GM&lt;/span&gt; doing well, because they&amp;#8217;ve cracked battery, hydrogen and self-driving&amp;nbsp;technologies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that today is going to be a &amp;#8220;everything retrace.&amp;#8221; It might be a good day to pick up some bargains.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;XOM&lt;/span&gt; (Exxon Mobil) is now yielding over 9%, with an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EV&lt;/span&gt;/Sales of 1.0.  Compare this to $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFLX&lt;/span&gt;, which has a nil yield, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EV&lt;/span&gt;/Sales of 10.5. It&amp;#8217;s last twelve month&amp;#8217;s P/E was about 87. This is factoring in gigantic growth, but I struggle to see where this will come from, without sacrificing revenue, given the sheer number of streaming services now available. 
But I&amp;#8217;ve thought this for a couple of years, and I&amp;#8217;ve been consistently wrong, so you&amp;#8217;ve been warned.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFLX&lt;/span&gt; seems an absolute bargain compared to $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROKU&lt;/span&gt;. The latter is trading at an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EV&lt;/span&gt;/Sales of 15+. Its share price shot up 5% today (against a falling market), on a favourable report from some investment bank. 
It doesn&amp;#8217;t pay a dividend, or make profits, of&amp;nbsp;course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Close&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything (including bonds and oil) taking a dive. Gold &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; green.
All equity markets, everywhere going down. 
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; down 20%.

I find it frankly baffling that when &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CB&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s talk about using an autonomous regime for interest rates, the formula includes totally unobservable numbers, such as r* (the &amp;#8220;neutral real interest rate&amp;#8221;). 
Years ago, there was a lot of focus on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAIRU&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8212; the &amp;#8220;Non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment.&amp;#8221; 
I guess this is because the idea that technocrats would actually have a say on something so politically important is a&amp;nbsp;fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Close&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, nothing much happened today, as expected.
I read a few chapters of &amp;#8220;Fooled by Randomness&amp;#8221; by N N Taleb. 
It&amp;#8217;s a real pity that the guy has such an obnoxious personality, because actually some of the stuff he writes makes a lot of sense. If only he did not write as if his understanding of all this stuff was two standard deviations above the rest of the planet. It&amp;#8217;s not exactly an original thought that a distribution can have an average which is very different from the most probable value. When I was about 14 my maths teacher asked the class what the average number of legs you could expect of the world&amp;#8217;s population of humans. It didn&amp;#8217;t take us long to arrive at the conclusion that it was slightly below two, even though no human actually had 1.9999&amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp;legs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="$TSLA"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>So, it was Softbank all along!</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/so-it-was-softbank-all-along.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-09-06T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-09-06:/so-it-was-softbank-all-along.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; Stocks pumped by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OTM&lt;/span&gt; Calls bought by&amp;nbsp;Softbank!!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; stocks where the management are continuously draining the free float via buybacks (to prevent the dilution that would otherwise occur if the senior management exercised their&amp;nbsp;options),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Long-only passive funds that are obliged to keep buying big tech names whenever money is moved from active to passive&amp;nbsp;management,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;compliance officers on the backs of the traders writing calls to &amp;#8220;reduce&amp;#8221; their risk by buying the tightly-held underlying because they don&amp;#8217;t want to have a fail if the tail risk is realized and the have to&amp;nbsp;deliver,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;no sane active manager having any discretionary holding of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; stocks because they represent just terrible&amp;nbsp;value,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dark pools, high-frequency trading and highly opaque trading for cash &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;derivatives,&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks pretty quiet. 
European and Asian equity markets down a bit, but not crashing.
Currencies about flat, bonds not much changed, nor commods. 
In the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; this is a half-day public holiday and a lot of the dealers will have taken the day off as part of a long weekend.
Tuesday, when the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; markets open properly, will be&amp;nbsp;interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to finish early.
When I last looked, most markets were spookily quiet: the dealing rooms must be&amp;nbsp;deserted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Worth Reading: Lacy&amp;nbsp;Hunt&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.macrovoices.com/guest-content/list-guest-transcripts/3639-2020-04-30-transcript-of-the-podcast-interview-between-erik-townsend-and-lacy-hunt/file"&gt;This transcript&lt;/a&gt; is of Lacy Hunt explaining his deflation thesis.
It seems to rest on the argument that over the next few years the economy is going to massively undershoot 
its trend growth, meaning that there is a lot of slack in the economy, meaning that there will be deflation.
He also explains, in a bit more detail, why productivity is killed when there is too much debt.
It&amp;#8217;s interesting, but somehow I am still not completely convinced.
He&amp;#8217;s obviously been right when everyone else has been wrong: central banks have serially tried to raise inflation without success.
But somehow, at some point, &lt;em&gt;spending&lt;/em&gt; (not &lt;em&gt;lending&lt;/em&gt;) by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CB&lt;/span&gt; must result in some sort of excess of money over goods.
I get it that velocity is slowing, but can it fully compensate for the money creation?

It&amp;#8217;s not Plender&amp;#8217;s finest work, but it shows how inflation fears are being reported on almost daily now 
in the mainstream media. 
I think that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; should allow columnists never to update their photos. 
The new one of Plender is awful.
I&amp;#8217;d prefer to think of his as never-changing old profile&amp;nbsp;pic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/business/inflation-worse-pandemic-coronavirus.html"&gt;An economics professor points out that for ordinary consumers prices are rising faster than official statistics&lt;/a&gt;.
Again, this is a well documented phenomenon, but the volume of articles pointing it out has&amp;nbsp;risen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Market&amp;nbsp;report&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets getting more skittish. 
Sept. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; future up around 29. Has been going up since around 27th Aug. It is twice the level of Feb.,
even though the market is higher and seemingly sailing on a millpond.
Bonds too have been going up (yields down) since then.
Gold has been basically going nowhere since this time (executed a &amp;#8216;prarie dog&amp;#8217; formation).
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LB&lt;/span&gt; is on a clear downward path.
Food commods are pretty quiet, in spite of news of high food inflation in China.
There may be some complication about how China is disconnected to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; commod. futures.
Copper down 1% to under $3/lb (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYMEX&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TLSA&lt;/span&gt; is down about 7%. Maybe the Robinhood bagholders are starting to read up about stock splits and dilution.
Or maybe it&amp;#8217;s just a cunning bear trap laid by Elon, who currently in Germany subsidy truffle&amp;nbsp;hunting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASDAQ&lt;/span&gt;) down 5.2%. A healthy correction before a retrace tomorrow? The beginning of the end?
Who knows? Certainly not me! Global equity&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten year yields of govt. bonds up across the board, except&amp;nbsp;Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities down, including&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are not many places to hide. Currencies broadly&amp;nbsp;unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Thought for the&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wetherspoons have a great app, and are very busy locally to me.
A lot of the &lt;em&gt;bien pensants&lt;/em&gt; sneer at this unpretentious value-for-money pub chain,

&lt;p&gt;I finally got around to creating a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FRED&lt;/span&gt; chart which combines two series. I could probably do it better, but I&amp;#8217;m pleased with the result.

&lt;p&gt;I finally got around to creating a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FRED&lt;/span&gt; chart which combines two series. I could probably do it better, but I&amp;#8217;m pleased with the result. This is for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, but global monetary conditions are usually closely correlated&amp;nbsp;(proof?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is interesting is that this is exactly what Scott Sumner has been saying for years: monetary policy has been too tight because real interest rates are too high, in spite of nominal ones being historically low.
Inflation comes from labour costs rising. The mass movement of peasants into factories in China was a huge disinflationary shock. That is largely over. Maybe we&amp;#8217;ll see something different over the next couple of decades.
Of course, I might be totally off the&amp;nbsp;mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trend would of course explain the stonking equity market performance of late. Low inflation favours stocks, but eventually the runaway cost of capital and labour overwhelms the benefit of cheap&amp;nbsp;debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also argues that the dollar should continue to fall, assuming that other currencies aren&amp;#8217;t going as rapidly to sub-zero real rates (which they may well&amp;nbsp;be). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=v5Yp&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"style="overflow:hidden; width:670px; height:525px;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe a better measure of real&amp;nbsp;rates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=v7gC&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"style="overflow:hidden; width:670px; height:525px;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are hitting a forty-year low in govt. yields. With real rates finally rising and central banks determined (this time) to keep re-filling the punchbowl, what could possibly go wrong? (I&amp;#8217;m sorry, the iframe doesn&amp;#8217;t work and I don&amp;#8217;t have time to work out why now, but you can click &lt;a href="https://koyfin.com/s/BD9coEixYp"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the chart on&amp;nbsp;Koyfin.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="800" height="600 " src="https://koyfin.com/share/godLhr4xNY/simple" frameBorder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Koyfin is not perfect, but the speed of data retrieval for charts is totally astounding.
I don&amp;#8217;t know what the business model is, but if I were Mike Bloomberg I&amp;#8217;d be worried. Well, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, I probably would be too rich to be worried, but, seriously, the competition is catching up fast on The&amp;nbsp;Terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Expensive rents are dropping&amp;nbsp;fast&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In San Francisco, but surely London won&amp;#8217;t be far behind. Why pay through the nose for a studio flat in Zone 3 when you can get a detached house in Beds for&amp;nbsp;less?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Opening&amp;nbsp;bell&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade-weighted dollar is back to where it was in 2018. 
It is, from a multi-year perspective, definitely on a downward trend.
Precious metals are&amp;nbsp;weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds are weak. With the exception of German and France, basically yields are up across all maturities and all sovereign&amp;nbsp;issuers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; hasn&amp;#8217;t move much, but I read that the term structure is very steep, reflecting the election uncertainty.
(I can&amp;#8217;t locate this on Koyfin: logically it should be $VXn where n=2.. but it&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still can&amp;#8217;t get over the fact that a manufacturer of cellphones, a notoriously low-margin business, with a market share of well under 20% of the global market, which share is also declining, has zoomed up to a market cap which now exceeds the sum of all companies in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTSE&lt;/span&gt;-100. At some point that has to be worth shorting&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/federal-reserve-we-got-it-wrong-on-postcrisis-rate-hikes-201428730.html"&gt;More dovish&amp;nbsp;talk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t improve on &lt;a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/sp-reaches-critical-resistance-valuation-record-high-liquidity-crashes"&gt;Zerohedge today&lt;/a&gt;.
(I can&amp;#8217;t believe that Twitter disabled &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZH&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s account: it has some excellent content, such as &lt;a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/economics/cbo-projects-us-debt-will-hit-record-107-gdp-2023-and-then-explode"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.
Both articles are worth reading in detail. The second one concludes that debt at 180% of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; by 2050 will result in a war is not convincing: I believe that Japanese debt is around 270% of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; and that&amp;#8217;s an exceptionally peaceful place. We might get &amp;#8220;fiscal dominance&amp;#8221; (which, as I understand it, is the state of the nation when the central bank no longer even pretends it&amp;#8217;s independent from the&amp;nbsp;treasury).&lt;/p&gt;

Why, I have no idea, except &amp;#8220;Stocks only go up!&amp;#8221; (for those whose memories don&amp;#8217;t go back to&amp;nbsp;March).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start, things are quiet, except I&amp;nbsp;noticed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;long Treasury bond futures are definitely trending down: maybe someone is listening to Powell saying that inflation is finally going to rip (&amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAIT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221;: Flexible Average Inflation Targetting). The seem to have forgotten about&amp;nbsp;R*.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;soft commodities strong, especially soy beans. Corn, dropping however. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DBC&lt;/span&gt; probably a good way to get exposure to a balance portfolio of&amp;nbsp;softs,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;precious metals pretty flat. Although gold is the &amp;#8220;anti-dollar&amp;#8221; as Anantha Nageswaran describes it in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; today, it does have a tendency to be somewhat risk on in terms of its correlation with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; (0.2 beta according to &lt;a href="https://unicornbay.com/tools/beta-calculator"&gt;unicorn bay&lt;/a&gt;),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; getting very bearish about the dollar, but sceptical that it will help the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;economy,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; after a stunning run is a bit weaker today; it&amp;#8217;s price performance has been &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/31/tesla-the-triple-wtf-chart-of-the-year-just-put-your-brain-on-tesla-autopilot-and-believe-in-it/"&gt;nothing short of insane&lt;/a&gt;. I am not sure exactly why, but it must be in at least some small part fashion, and the rise of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESG&lt;/span&gt; funds and&amp;nbsp;ETFs. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turkish Lira falls a bit more against the&amp;nbsp;Euro,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there is a strong contango in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; (Sept is 28, Nov is&amp;nbsp;31),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unicredit is trading at about half it&amp;#8217;s regulatory&amp;nbsp;capital. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Labour market stronger than&amp;nbsp;expected&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statistics on the labour market are always difficult to get, and with so many schemes to pay money to employers to bribe them into not sacking workers, things are murkier than ever.
&lt;a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2020/june/reading-labor-market-real-time?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=202009%20Research%20Newsletter&amp;amp;utm_content=202009%20Research%20Newsletter+CID_488395bf4c210988f724c5ff4c2d63e1&amp;amp;utm_source=Research%20newsletter&amp;amp;utm_term=Reading%20the%20US%20labor%20market%20in%20real%20time"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; from the St. Louis Fed suggests that the job losses have been less than expected, and are recovering&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t really understand the technical details of this post, but the bottom line seems to be that the labour market is stronger than expected, with employment down less than 9% compared to January 2020. 
I can&amp;#8217;t observe anywhere in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; directly, and I am not out and about much in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. 
My perception is that there is a lot of working from home, still, which is still working, and may even represent improving&amp;nbsp;efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A separate post (no link, sorry) suggested that hourly wages were increasing.
I don&amp;#8217;t know the detail, but I would have thought that this would point to a weak market, 
as firms would lay off their less productive (and presumably worse paid) employees, leaving the average for the remainder higher (but with no individual worker having any more pay, at least per&amp;nbsp;hour).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wrap&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt; is now worth more than the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTSE&lt;/span&gt; ($Z). Up about 4% today.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; is down, also about 4%, after announcing it would issue extra equity capital via a so-called &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATM&lt;/span&gt; (At The Market) issue, which seems to be a sort of inverted share buyback programme. This seems to be favoured only by no-income biotech stocks at an early stage, and seems very unsuitable for an issuer like $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;, but we shall see.
There is a lot of talk about the insiders cashing out.
Overall, most equity indexes were&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other markets, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; a bit stronger, most commodities down including &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LB&lt;/span&gt; (lumber). 
This has risen insanely, alongside $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZM&lt;/span&gt;, the complete opposite of $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JETS&lt;/span&gt;.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TLT&lt;/span&gt; was up, so it&amp;#8217;s hard to classify this as risk on or risk off.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TOPX&lt;/span&gt; was flat in spite of&amp;nbsp;Warren.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category><category term="economics"></category></entry><entry><title>Late Summer Bank Holiday 2020 Edition</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/late-summer-bank-holiday-2020-edition.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-31T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:42:46+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-08-31:/late-summer-bank-holiday-2020-edition.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Honk Kong not so fragrant real estate&amp;nbsp;market&lt;/h1&gt;

Alexandra Elbakyan is threatening to be the Napster of science publishing.
As others have observed, it&amp;#8217;s bizarre that the World Wide Web, which was invented to share scientific journal articles freely and easily isn&amp;#8217;t used for that, even now, twenty seven years after it was invented.
Scientific publishers make a lot of money publishing very valuable articles written by highly qualified authors, who are nevertheless not paid for their efforts (at least by the publishers). The institutions who do employ these authors, nevertheless pay publishers an absolute fortune for access to the very work that their (collective) employees have created and given away to the publishers for free. Moreover, all the work of reviewing and checking and editing and curating these articles is done by academics, other than the authors, also for&amp;nbsp;free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand the economic justification for copyright, and I understand that scientific publishing is not some cesspit of exploitation.
But I cannot help thinking that maybe the model is outdated and that because the cost of distributing the data is now essentially zero that the cost to end users should approximate the same marginal&amp;nbsp;cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t actually used the site: my searches don&amp;#8217;t seem to show up anything, and I wonder if it has been in some way handicapped by parties who suffer economic damage from its existence. You can visit the website &lt;a href="https://sci-hub.ee/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

&amp;#8220;Services&amp;#8221; is such a mis-mash category: I always used to think of it as things like transport/distribution, but actually much bigger items in the category are rent, healthcare and&amp;nbsp;education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rent is such an odd part of national accounting. So much of it is an imputed amount which owner occupiers pay to themselves in exchange for the use of properties they have bought (or are&amp;nbsp;buying).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NY&lt;/span&gt; Fed Macroeconomic model available on&amp;nbsp;Github&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2015/12/the-frbny-dsge-model-meets-julia.html"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; describes how the model comes to be on github.
&lt;a href="https://github.com/FRBNY-DSGE/DSGE.jl"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is the actual repository.
As someone who (many, many) years ago implemented a macro model to run on a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt;, I am very tempted to 
try to install this, but my head tells me I&amp;#8217;ll spend frustrating hours just getting it to run,
and get very little in the way of insight into what will happen out of it.
It&amp;#8217;s nice to know that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NY&lt;/span&gt; Fed is willing to share this with the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julia sounds a cool language, and even though the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NY&lt;/span&gt; Fed could undoubtedly afford a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MATLAB&lt;/span&gt; licence,
it recognizes the huge advantage of writing in an open source&amp;nbsp;language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Viruses&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/essay/2020/08/20/viruses-have-big-impacts-on-ecology-and-evolution-as-well-as-human-health"&gt;This amazing essay on viruses in the Economist&lt;/a&gt; is well worth reading.
Microbiology is so much more interesting that footage of megafauna.
If we want biodiversity, then bacteria, archaea and viruses certainly deliver&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Wonderful&amp;nbsp;podcast&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/@ttmygh/grant-williams-podcast-lacy-hunt-8409df5eb203"&gt;Grant and Bill interview Lacy Hunt&lt;/a&gt;.
The guest is that rarest of successful investors, a serious academic economist.
This is another discussion about inflation, 
He talks a lot about the production function, (and, a bit, about velocity), about Robert Gordon&amp;#8217;s book, 
&amp;#8220;The Rise and Fall of American Growth,&amp;#8221; and Japan.
Interestingly, he says that changes over the short term (a year or two) are simply unpredictable 
using macroeconomics, but that changes over the longer term are reliably predictable.
Dr Hunt makes the case that inflation is going to be lower than most people expect.
Like a lot of people, I have been expecting inflation for a long time,
a lot of people say that we&amp;#8217;re never going to get it.
Unlike most people, Dr Hunt has an explanation other than that we haven&amp;#8217;t seen it yet so why should we see it&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Towards the fully automated company</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/towards-the-fully-automated-company.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-28T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-08-28:/towards-the-fully-automated-company.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="Stock Market Warns Workers That They’re The Problem For Business"&gt;Stock Market Warns Workers That They’re The Problem For&amp;nbsp;Business&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A dash for the exits (front&amp;nbsp;doors)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think that securities markets are complicated, take a look at real estate.

I am always on the lookout for something that will tip the balance so that
there are net sales of index funds.
Maybe this is it, but the odds are&amp;nbsp;long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Markets this&amp;nbsp;morning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things are pretty flat. 
Jackson Hole didn&amp;#8217;t make any difference, as far as I can tell.
Precious metals are catching up a bit with other commodities.
Bonds are flat.
The Nikkei seems not to care about Shinzo Abe&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;departure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Market Ear has noticed that &lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cHqf5PXJpi"&gt;oil has basically stopped moving&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is in contrast to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MOVE&lt;/span&gt; index (Treasury vol), which seems to be moving steadily higher.

In the nineteen thirties the big debate was whether monetary policy was enough to overcome the 
massive spike in unemployment. The debate was between those who thought that it was and those
(like Benjamin Anderson) who felt that massive re-allocation of capital and labour had to take place to bring 
all markets back into equilibrium.
Although there was no clear winner, the latter argument was popular enough that politically the Fed was much more limited than it is today.
We will see in the next year whether monetary policy is enough on its own. 
I really don&amp;#8217;t have a strong view, but I do think that we do need quite a lot of monetary policy,
because otherwise we are facing a very grim&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2020/08/22/britains-government-axes-public-health-england"&gt;I love the way that the Economist knows its readers so well that it can be scathing about Dido Harding while appearing to be perfectly factual in its coverage of her appointment as head as the successor body to Public Health England&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;em&gt;Dido Harding, the organisation’s boss, who has management experience in food retail and telecoms, is not universally regarded as the right&amp;nbsp;choice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Russia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-demands-transparent-probe-22583601"&gt;Alexei Navalny has probably been poisoned by Putin&lt;/a&gt;.
The sheer bravado with which Putin liquidates his opponents is enough to earn some admiration,
if only for ruthlessness.
He is an extraordinary presence, but the totalitarian rule in Russia must surely end up bankrupting the country.
The same must be true of China, even though it is currently very economically successful.
Democracy is a messy system, but it&amp;#8217;s the only one that has an automatic mechanism for removing&amp;nbsp;corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mrs&amp;nbsp;America&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; miniseries called &lt;em&gt;Mrs America.&lt;/em&gt; At the end, Phyllis Schafly gets a call from Ronald Regan 
telling her that she&amp;#8217;s not getting the post of ambassador to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UN&lt;/span&gt; that she hoped to get. 
The person that Reagan appointed was Jean Kirkpatrick, originator of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkpatrick_Doctrine"&gt;Kirkpatrick Doctrine&lt;/a&gt; justified propping up anti-communist regimes, but at the cost of supporting other types of totalitarian ones.
I totally understand that true democracies do not react well to being pushed around by foreign governments.
That&amp;#8217;s why foreign aid tends to have the effect of maintaining the status quo in regimes which are run by 
dictators. 
I understand the logic, but I long for the time when a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; foreign secretary could state that he would pursue an
ethical foreign policy (even if the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FCO&lt;/span&gt; prevented him from doing&amp;nbsp;so).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It came as a surprise to nobody who is even vaguely aware of what Jackson Hole is (apart from a holiday resort) that J Powell is going to allow inflation to run hot and put more emphasis on jobs than price stability.
There was quite a bit of volatility in the market over this, but eventually things settled down much where they were&amp;nbsp;yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, surely, tilts the probability distribution of where inflation will be in a years&amp;#8217; time over to the right,
but exactly what  happens, nobody knows. 
If they did, they certainly would not be earning a crust writing analyst reports for Bloomberg or an investment bank, as they would be richer than Jeff Bezos ($200 billion, and&amp;nbsp;counting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most equity markets down.
Bonds down too: what?
Commodities up, mainly, except gold, which was down.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; up, so I guess overall risk&amp;nbsp;off.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Stormy Weather, calm markets</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/stormy-weather-calm-markets.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-26T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-08-26:/stormy-weather-calm-markets.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Morning&amp;nbsp;comment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; and China had talks about talks about their phase 1 trade deal,
delayed from a couple of weeks ago.
My perception is that this means that someone is trying to pump the&amp;nbsp;stockmarket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The battle between Apple and the makers of Fortnite grinds on.
I think that this will end up with Apple giving at least some ground.
It helps the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; competition commissioner in her argument that these 
tech giants are&amp;nbsp;oligopolists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another black man was shot in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;. 
The number of people killed by the police in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; is 
about twenty-five times the number executed, even though the 
debate over capital punishment seems much more high profile.
It all seems so unnecessary, but the Americans sure love their&amp;nbsp;guns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the final day of the ballot to choose the new leader of the Liberal Democrats.
Nobody cares what the result is, with the possible exception of (Sir) Ed Davey,
who is, as the papers say, &amp;#8220;the bookies favourite.&amp;#8221; 
I can&amp;#8217;t imagine that the betting was very&amp;nbsp;heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you thought that the Nasdaq price performance was something to do with how software was eating the world (from The Market&amp;nbsp;Ear):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://tme1.fra1.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/fb5364768419e542220700c8eef4acb6" width=750&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, the annual shindig at Jackson Hole, where central bankers hobnob with each other, is virtual.
It&amp;#8217;s expected that they will all congratulate each other about what a fantastic job they&amp;#8217;ve done.
The assumption is that Powell will announce that he&amp;#8217;ll introduced &amp;#8220;average inflation targetting,&amp;#8221; which means letting inflation run hot for as long as it&amp;#8217;s undershot in the past.
I cannot help thinking this will be good for commodities and commodity currencies, 
but what do I&amp;nbsp;know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Greenlight&amp;nbsp;Capital&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a fan of David Einhorn.
He runs a hedge fund, Greenlight Capital.
Like all regulated funds, he files 13-F reports to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEC&lt;/span&gt;.
The latest one &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1079114/000117266120001844/0001172661-20-001844-index.htm"&gt;can be viewed here&lt;/a&gt;.
There is a write-up &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4370584-tracking-david-einhorns-portfolio-q2-2020-update"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
I would not suggest trying to replicate such a fund&amp;#8217;s holdings,
but it&amp;#8217;s interesting to see how very successful investors are changing their investment strategy in response to events.
Of course, this data is lagging, and the fund may have sold the stocks mentioned, 
but I don&amp;#8217;t think Einhorn is some sort of glorified day trader.
He seems to be going all-in on gold, together with small stakes in some rather dull sounding industries:
mattresses, gas water heaters, fast food, broadband services, apparel and washing machines.
He has made a big bet on specialized air freight.
The logic of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAWW&lt;/span&gt; is that with fewer passenger planes flying,
specialized air freight companies will be able to clean up.
I can see the logic, but I really don&amp;#8217;t know enough about this to have a firm&amp;nbsp;view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing Wrap (6pm &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are still risk on: equities up a bit, same for commodities, bonds&amp;nbsp;down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not convinced that mortgage deliquencies are a blip. 
&lt;a href="https://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2020/08/freddie-mac-mortgage-serious.html"&gt;They have jumped up&lt;/a&gt; but the Calculated Risk blog things that this is nothing to worry about.&amp;nbsp;Yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/earth-fed-inflation-mandate-has-been-met"&gt;Another contribution to the inflation measurement debate&lt;/a&gt;.
Basically,  Joseph Carson, former chief economist at AllianceBernstein states that, even after &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPI&lt;/span&gt; was &amp;#8220;fixed&amp;#8221; after Greenspan said it overstated experienced inflation, it has still run at or above the target for most of the last ten years. Therefore, the plan to run it even hotter, with &amp;#8220;average inflation targetting&amp;#8221; is going to result in, presumably, very serious&amp;nbsp;inflation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Morning&amp;nbsp;comment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on bonds, things are still risk on.
Equities still going up, from the momentum gained&amp;nbsp;yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Fleck said about yesterday &lt;em&gt;There isn&amp;#8217;t much to say about the action and the stock market today, as the dynamics of passive investing, structured products along with their rebalancing and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt;, continue to force the market higher&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Afternoon&amp;nbsp;comment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today Exxon dropped out of the Dow Jones Index, after 92 years.
Maybe oil products really aren&amp;#8217;t that important any longer, but I fail to see how transport can transition to carbon neutral operation without imposing huge costs on travellers.
Of course, this is exactly what governments are able to do, so maybe the valuation is completely&amp;nbsp;correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cA0-zibFbe"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPM&lt;/span&gt; Equity Strategy is bullish on tech&lt;/a&gt;. 
You can read the article yourself. Essentially, tech is not expensive relative to the rest of the market on a P/E basis.
I think that this means that it may not go down, relative to the rest of the market.
The index considered is not the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANGMAN&lt;/span&gt;, though, so the &amp;#8216;momentum has run too far&amp;#8217; argument can&amp;#8217;t really be used.
The problem with Big Tech is that a lot of it is not really tech: Microsoft writes software, for sure, but I would bet that a few percent of it&amp;#8217;s employees are actually involved in writing new code, probably less than many non-tech companies. I don&amp;#8217;t really know, but it seems to me that Google &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Facebook should really be classified as advertising stocks, Amazon as a retailer (with a lucrative sideline in cloud services), Microsoft a tech support company, and Netflix a media company, and Apple a phone manufacturer. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMD&lt;/span&gt; and Nvidia probably do qualify as tech, admittedly, but they are the little brothers of the&amp;nbsp;others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soft commodities up, metals down slightly, yields up, equities up, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; futures down, (93.015).

&lt;p&gt;There is no clear direction to this market, although it&amp;#8217;s a Monday so of course the Nasdaq is&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities are weak, bonds are up so my gut says we&amp;#8217;re due for a down day in equities, in spite of the initial&amp;nbsp;buoyancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mind of Wall&amp;nbsp;Street&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m reading &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/793965.The_Mind_of_Wall_Street"&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt;. 
It&amp;#8217;s an enjoyable fast read.
There is still a chunk left to read, but the main takeaway I have is that the conventional wisdom is always wrong,
in the end, but it&amp;#8217;s hard to stick to your views when the world thinks you&amp;#8217;re&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.highshortinterest.com/"&gt;This site&lt;/a&gt; is good for seeing what hedge funds really think about high-flying stocks. 
Mike Green of Logica Advisors has identified having a low-float and being part of a big index (ideally the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt;) as the source of momentum. Basically, trackers &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to buy as investors move money flow into passive funds, so those with a low float get bid up beyond all fundamentals. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; is not in the index, but it probably has the lowest free float of any stock. 
At some point, maybe a long time from now, when the last discretionary fund has shuttered, passive funds will become net sellers. Once this happens, we will see this whole thing go into reverse. 
&lt;a href="https://shorttracker.co.uk/"&gt;There is a similar service in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Close&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a meme on Twitter that if it&amp;#8217;s a Monday then the Nasdaq will be green.
It seems to have worked for a bit, but I never took it seriously.
Well, it happened again tonight, just before the close.
It doesn&amp;#8217;t seem possible that a single agency could manipulate such a liquid index, 
but I cannot see any other&amp;nbsp;explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing a few people on Twitter noted was that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VXN&lt;/span&gt; (the Nasdaq equivalent of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt;) was up 4.75% vs the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; being down 3.58%. Obviously, these are derived from expectations of future volatility, implied by option prices. 
It may be nothing. 
Certainly, the bears seem to be scraping the bottom of the barrel now, but it&amp;#8217;s hard to see that there are any shorts left to&amp;nbsp;squeeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds are very slightly down (yields up), as you&amp;#8217;d expect from a risk on day. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; was&amp;nbsp;flat.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="booze"></category></entry><entry><title>Weekend thoughts</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/weekend-thoughts.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-24T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-08-24:/weekend-thoughts.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Helicopter Ben still to&amp;nbsp;blame&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big question is &amp;#8230; &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;?
Supplementary questions&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Japs did a lot of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt;. Why hasn&amp;#8217;t their stock market gone through the&amp;nbsp;roof?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the stocks that have gone up had fortress balance sheets already, and would have done well whether or not the Fed had stepped in. In fact, their competitors might have been driven out of&amp;nbsp;business. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can it really be Robinhood? The vast bulk of investment is via passive flows. Admittedly, there is no re-balancing with (market cap weighted) passive, but this goes for everything in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;500.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;Saturday!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The markets were closed today. 
It&amp;#8217;s been a rough week.
My evening read today is &lt;a href="https://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=levy+&amp;amp;title=mind+of+wall+street&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;isbn=&amp;amp;destination=gb&amp;amp;currency=GBP&amp;amp;mode=basic&amp;amp;st=sr&amp;amp;ac=qr"&gt;&amp;#8220;The Mind of Wall Street&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;. 
Unusually (for me), it&amp;#8217;s hardcopy (but not hardback). If you&amp;#8217;re local (well, say &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;) and you&amp;#8217;d like to read it drop me a line &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; I&amp;#8217;ll lend it to you for free. I will take a few days to read it. Initial chapters are very&amp;nbsp;encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good&amp;nbsp;night!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It&amp;#8217;s now&amp;nbsp;Sunday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;#8217;m too lazy to create a new&amp;nbsp;file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/21/shells-new-12-17-billion-largest-ever-floating-facility-shut-down-months-after-shipping-first-lng-cargo-made-uneconomical-by-long-plunge-of-lng-prices/"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; caught my eye.
Trends can persist for a long time. Clearly, the top people at Shell felt that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt; prices would be strong for a couple of decades after 2011. 
In fact, there has been a glut. 
The thesis that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt; was a byproduct of oil, and so when oil demand collapsed because of Covid the price of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt; would spike (thanks, Kuppy) has proved to be false. (Although, maybe it&amp;#8217;s too early to say&amp;#8230;)
Anyway, I keep an eye on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt;, as I think it has potential as a fuel beyond the next decade,
but I&amp;#8217;ve probably been too skeptical on green energy for a while, and the price may never recover.
I have no position in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt;, nor am I ever likely to take one at this&amp;nbsp;rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chasing Macro: Fiscal&amp;nbsp;Edition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MzxZu-KTrc"&gt;Episode 93&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://markethuddle.com/"&gt;The Macro Huddle&lt;/a&gt; was all about macro.
I listened to it in fragments, but my takeaways&amp;nbsp;were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;we&amp;#8217;ve run out of road on monetary policy, and fiscal is coming down the&amp;nbsp;road,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;politics matters, and until the elections are over, there may be a pause in&amp;nbsp;fiscal,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yield curve control is coming, and with it&amp;nbsp;inflation,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the dollar is going down (or up, or flat: one of the&amp;nbsp;above),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Natural Gas is probably going up: it&amp;#8217;s hard to see anything taking its place: Biden promises a lot but probably won&amp;#8217;t deliver, just like everyone thought that the new administration four years ago was going to do something about big pharma&amp;#8217;s outrageous&amp;nbsp;profits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of other stuff. Chase seems a cool guy. &lt;a href="https://www.pineconemacro.com/white-mountain-letter.html"&gt;His newsletters&lt;/a&gt; seem a good read and can&amp;#8217;t be beaten on value for money (they are&amp;nbsp;free!).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="money"></category><category term="nat-gas"></category><category term="politics-matters"></category></entry><entry><title>google cloud shell</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/google-cloud-shell.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-23T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:16:43+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-08-23:/google-cloud-shell.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Google Cloud&amp;nbsp;Computing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fleck thinks that yield curve control is coming, even though the Fed says its not (it has form).
He seems to think the dollar has gone down too far. If it rallies hard, it will be bad news for risk&amp;nbsp;assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am surprised that there is not more attention paid to the dollar. 
The level of debt being issued by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury is unprecedented. 
It is very hard to see how it can ever be paid down other by inflating it away,
which would be very negative for the dollar, which would be negative for the dollar,
except that every other country on the planet either is already on the same path,
or soon will be&amp;nbsp;(maybe).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interest rates and&amp;nbsp;savings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/19/how-negative-interest-rates-sap-consumer-spending-by-an-ever-larger-part-of-consumers-retirees/"&gt;Oldies are in trouble&lt;/a&gt;.
You can see why so many people think that as interest rates go down, 
people are forced to save more of their income.
This is the opposite of what the naive &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LS&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IM&lt;/span&gt; model would predict.
The whole model seems ludicrously naive. 
There are so many interest rates in the economy, not just a single one.
Of course a zero or negative nominal rate might co-exist with a horribly large real one,
which we might yet see if the economy&amp;nbsp;stalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finally&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/14/fired-up-by-stimulus-money-debt-deferrals-americans-went-shopping-but-where-how-life-has-changed-during-the-pandemic/"&gt;Some amazing charts showing the impact of Covid on the economy&lt;/a&gt;. Talk about whiplash! 
It will be interesting how algorithms cope with these totally unprecedented&amp;nbsp;moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;High Entropy&amp;nbsp;Secrets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t really know what these are, but I was surprised to be told that I&amp;#8217;d committed (in the git sense) a high-entropy secret to the repo that this blog is saved in. What was quite spooky was that I hadn&amp;#8217;t appreciated that some clever software was scanning my blog for this, or anything else. I probably did sign up for gitlabs, so I&amp;#8217;m not suggesting that anything happened without my consent.
&lt;a href="https://www.gitguardian.com/"&gt;Read more here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am convinced that there is a lot of fraud going on in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESG&lt;/span&gt; space. 
Greenwash is a great way to make people not pay attention to what is a terrible business model.
&lt;a href="https://www.sprucepointcap.com/gfl-environmental-inc/"&gt;This  example&lt;/a&gt; is probably worth looking at&amp;nbsp;closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Close&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally risk on. 
Yields (developed markets sovereign) down, equities up, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; down, commodities generally down, except &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt;. 
Dollar up, against most currencies except a few commodity currencies (e.g. Ruble).
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; up a lot.

&lt;p&gt;Risk off, although equities seem to bounce back after hours.
Dollar and bonds seem to be rallying: maybe things have been overdone.
Precious metals up a bit, but I&amp;#8217;m getting nervous about all inflation trades,
given that it&amp;#8217;s not clear if the Fed can keep creating money in the face of collapsing 
demand for debt in the real economy.
The argument is very cogently put by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouIjbckJF4Y&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;Steven van Metre on the Market Huddle&lt;/a&gt;.
I certainly believe that commercial banks are the main creators of money,
and the Fed cannot make people spend.
I am not convinced by van Metre, but I can see that the Fed will not have an easy job 
creating inflation, as if anyone who has seen what has happened in Japan over the last thirty years will&amp;nbsp;confirm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; broke through $2K. The insanity knows no bounds. It just shows what happens when there are buyers but no sellers in a market.

&lt;p&gt;Everything quiet as the grave.

except the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTSE&lt;/span&gt;, which was down 1%.
That is except Borsa Istanbul, which was up 0.6%, in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TRY&lt;/span&gt; terms.
In &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EUR&lt;/span&gt; terms, not so much, which also goes for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt;.
The Euro is up a lot against the dollar this year. 
Robin Brooks was quoted in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; as saying that it&amp;#8217;s unsustainable,
which I guess is another way of saying that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt; is going to lose the race to devalue its currency to the Fed.
Clearly, the Fed has a lot going for it, not least over a hundred years of doing its own thing. 
However, the dollar has a lot going for it too, not least the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; military, 
which means a lot, I think, even in today&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Afternoon&amp;nbsp;thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;em&gt;sui generis.&lt;/em&gt; 
Although there are many companies that make battery electric vehicles, there are none quite as extraordinary as $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;. 
Maybe Musk is a genius, maybe he&amp;#8217;s a charlatan. 
Edison was a bit of both.
The story of the company is going to make a blockbuster film, one day, but for the moment you have to be satisfied with less visual sources. 
I would recommend &lt;a href="https://quoththeraven.podbean.com/e/quoth-the-raven-216-montana-skeptic/"&gt;this podcast&lt;/a&gt; for one side of the argument, but put by a measured sane individual (the Skeptic), being interviewed by a rather more excitable individual (Chris Irons). 
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QTR&lt;/span&gt; podcast series is rather uneven in quality, providing a platform for some out and out conspiracy theorists that the mainstream media would not touch with a bargepole. 
My view is that we should be grown up enough to make up our own minds.
Please do so for the episode&amp;nbsp;above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/19/the-fed-made-sure-the-rich-got-richer-during-the-pandemic-why-thats-bad-for-the-economy/"&gt;Wolf Richer&lt;/a&gt; says that most of us didn&amp;#8217;t actually get richer, from the Fed&amp;#8217;s actions. 
The divergence is not so extreme in Europe, but I can&amp;#8217;t believe that the BoE really reduced inequality by its actions.
&lt;a href="https://alkhaleejtoday.co/business/5033088/The-road-to-inflation-in-post-COVID-times.html"&gt;There is generational inequality too, for sure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Close&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything went into reverse today. 
Turkish Lira rallied, against the odds,
commodities rallies, apart from precious metals,
the dollar index went up by 0.5%.
Equities were generally up, with the exception of China and China-related (e.g. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HK&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Singapore).
Volumes probably thin, but I didn&amp;#8217;t bother to check.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOMC&lt;/span&gt; minutes released today. Chatter about yield curve control, somehow supposed to explain drop in precious metals.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[In March 2008.] I learned a lot at Soros, but not what I thought I would learn. I did not learn what makes the yen go up or down, or what makes the stock market go up or down. Soros’s great gift was how to use leverage, and how much money to have down based on the risk/reward and your sense of conviction. His view on the yen or the euro was better than random, but not much. And yet he was still one of the great money managers ever because he knew how to bet his convictions. 

&amp;#8212; Stanley Druckenmiller
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Charlie Munger, no slouch himself, has the opposite view to Druck &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Soros: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“My partner Charlie says there is only three ways a smart person can go broke: liquor, ladies, and leverage. Now the truth is, the first two he just added because they started with ‘L’ – It’s leverage.” 

&amp;#8212; Warren Buffett
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess the difference is that Soros/Druckenmiller are traders, and Buffett/Munger are&amp;nbsp;investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soros has said &lt;a href="http://www.quoteswise.com/george-soros-quotes.html"&gt;some deeply insightful things&lt;/a&gt;. 
I&amp;#8217;ve read his book on reflexivity, a long time ago,
but I found it trite. 
Maybe I should try&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Einhorn&amp;nbsp;picks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/david-einhorns-top-5-trades-220632952.html"&gt;Einhorn&amp;#8217;s picks&lt;/a&gt; seem fairly conventional.
It&amp;#8217;s interesting that he is going for a gold miner &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt;, rather than a specific miner, like Berkshire Hathaway, which is going all in on $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GOLD&lt;/span&gt; (Barrick Gold&amp;nbsp;Corp). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bubble&amp;nbsp;stocks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cNy112VVRh"&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt; is insane&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Yes, you knew, but &amp;#8230; seriously? 
To me this is dot com bubble all over again, but like back then, plenty of people saw it coming, rather fewer made any money out of the&amp;nbsp;crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dollar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar is not falling against everything. 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NZD&lt;/span&gt; is an interesting&amp;nbsp;exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EftMDucWoAEKbvt?format=jpg&amp;name=large" width=800 &gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inflation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPI&lt;/span&gt; was out last Friday. 
Even when demand collapsed, it still went up, quite steeply.
It&amp;#8217;s hard to read a lot into a single number, and of course supply was in deep shock, but everyone (well, the gold bugs, anyway) see this as a sign that inflation is about to take off. That and the fact that the Fed seems set on average inflation targeting, which means that they&amp;#8217;ll let it run hot for a good long time before trying to take away the punchbowl (to mix two dead&amp;nbsp;metaphors).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; hits all-time&amp;nbsp;high&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter (at least my timeline) greeted this with a groan.
Lots saying they&amp;#8217;ll short it.
At some point it must surely crash heavily, but for the moment it seems a safer bet to short money against something &amp;#8216;real&amp;#8217;. &lt;em&gt;Not investment&amp;nbsp;advice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category><category term="gurus"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 17th August 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-17th-august-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-17T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-08-17:/market-notes-17th-august-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Market&amp;nbsp;action&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems like the main thing happening today is that &lt;a href="https://www.forexlive.com/news/!/usdjpy-falls-below-10600-as-dollar-weakness-extends-20200817"&gt;the dollar is starting to feel the impact of central bank money printing&lt;/a&gt;.

Commodities are up, across the board, 
equities are up (well, it would take a huge meteor strike on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYC&lt;/span&gt; to affect that),
&lt;em&gt;and bonds are up too&lt;/em&gt;.
The risk-on/risk-off narrative does not apply, although the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; continues to get crushed under the weight of&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general news, there is a big row over using the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; postal service for voting by mail in the presidential election in Nov., 
China is injecting a lot of stimulus into its economy,
Japan is looking very sick (which has pushed up its currency, explained by interest rate parity, maybe).
South-east Asia is in a parlous state. 
Open economies dependent on manufacturing and tourism are not going to do well in a time of&amp;nbsp;Covid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Close&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market action from this morning continued.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; jumped a ludicrous 11% to $1835. 
Fraud stocks ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIO&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NKLA&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;) account for 30% of total automotive market cap.
There will be a price to pay, but not today and almost certainly not&amp;nbsp;tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold was up 2.25%. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; futures were down&amp;nbsp;5.4%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/c3mlgLAUTG"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; looks important, but I don&amp;#8217;t really understand it. Gamma is always highest for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATM&lt;/span&gt; options, so I don&amp;#8217;t really get the significance of this.
There is a post &lt;a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/nomura-heres-what-fridays-gamma-unclenching-means-nasdaq"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; which explains what gamma clenching&amp;nbsp;is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My tentative understanding is that gamma tends to drag money into the index (the Nasdaq in this case). For a &amp;#8216;normal&amp;#8217; position in the index, via futures or passive funds, there is no need for whoever manages the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QQQ&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; to actually execute any trades: the existing cash hedge is all that is needed. With a positive gamma position, this is not the case. To keep hedged, someone somewhere has to buy more in the cash market. But this cannot be the passive funds: they transact only in response to retail buying or selling. It has to be the active managers, who are an endangered species and have probably sold all their crazily over-valued Nasdaq stocks anyway. So the market&amp;nbsp;goes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As money flows into the index, passive funds have no option other than to buy immediately (or get equivalent exposure via futures, but this will just force whoever is selling the futures to buy in the cash market to hedge &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; position). A positive gamma means that overall&amp;nbsp;exposure&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Text templating using Mustache on Windows</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/text-templating-using-mustache-on-windows.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-17T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:17:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-08-17:/text-templating-using-mustache-on-windows.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;The&amp;nbsp;problem&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to generate a series of text files from a template.

&lt;p&gt;I want to generate a series of text files from a template.
I was thinking about using the C preprocessor, cpp.
The advantage is that I have used it for years, 
the disadvantage is that it is specifically written to pre-process C code and is not really general purpose.
An additional disadvantage is that it appears not to be available as a standalone executable on&amp;nbsp;Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, I decided to use &lt;a href="https://mustache.github.io/mustache.1.html"&gt;Mustache&lt;/a&gt;.
This uses &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YAML&lt;/span&gt; to represent the variable part (content?) and seems to be available everywhere.
After a few false starts trying to use a Python implementation, I settled on the Ruby one.
It&amp;#8217;s quite possible to install Ruby and gem on Windows. I think I used &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21625582/is-there-a-standalone-portable-command-line-implementation-of-mustache-for-wind"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; to get going.
I had to update my Ruby install, as I know nothing about coding in the language and I just wanted a runnable&amp;nbsp;version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YAML&lt;/span&gt;, because it&amp;#8217;s such a lightweight syntax. It&amp;#8217;s used to create the various headers in Pelican, 
the processor that generates this very&amp;nbsp;page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Templates are very powerful. It&amp;#8217;s a pity that they are not used more. My former colleague Ian Williamson did some wonderful stuff with them,
using a parser he crafted using &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AWK&lt;/span&gt; (I&amp;nbsp;think). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got bogged down by the fact that my template had a pound sign in it (&amp;pound;).
After &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of experimenting, I discovered that the solution was to make the original template encoded as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UTF&lt;/span&gt;-8-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BOM&lt;/span&gt; (rather than &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UTF&lt;/span&gt;-8).
It&amp;#8217;s all to do with powershell having an inconsistent handling of encodings, I think,
but I really couldn&amp;#8217;t care&amp;nbsp;less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know much about encodings, but I now now that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BOM&lt;/span&gt; stands for Byte Order Mark. 
I think it&amp;#8217;s equivalent to the magic byte in unix that allows the file command to know what file type it&amp;#8217;s looking at.
Whatever it is, it fixes the problem nicely.
Random experimenting with lots of other encodings didn&amp;#8217;t work nearly so&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notepad++, which is an excellent editor, allows a file to be converted to a range of encodings at the click of a menu. 
It worked for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy&amp;nbsp;Coding!&lt;/p&gt;

So far, so well-known. 
What I had not realized previously was that Jared Krushner had shared a dorm as a student with the head of the agency that decided to select Kodak, a company with no previous experience of manufacturing phamaceuticals, for the loan. The fact that &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/kodak-spent-big-money-lobbying-trump-before-scoring-dollar765-million-covid-deal"&gt;Kodak had recently decided to spend $870K on lobbying&lt;/a&gt; is, of course, entirely&amp;nbsp;coincidental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/de9c3b4e-6c6d-40b1-868a-8f5366f59074?emailId=5f367b0f01805d0004f985ae&amp;amp;segmentId=c393f5a6-b640-bff3-cc14-234d058790ed"&gt;Kodak &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HCQ&lt;/span&gt; story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not an investigative reporter, and I have no idea if anything underhand is going on here, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t pass the smell&amp;nbsp;test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am strongly in favour of real capitalism, in which companies compete for capital in a free market and succeed as a result of creating more benefits for consumers (&amp;#8216;consumer surplus&amp;#8217; in the economists&amp;#8217; jargon). Left wing commentators will draw the completely wrong conclusion from this story, which is that more government, and more government is needed, to prevent these &amp;#8216;abuses&amp;#8217;. If the government left more money in the hands of consumers, business would have an incentive to pander to them, rather than faceless bureaucrats with political&amp;nbsp;connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Nixon Shock&amp;nbsp;Anniversary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia has a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_shock"&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; about the Nixon Shock: the announcement that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; would come off the gold standard, in 1971. People predicted that it would lead to inflation,
and you have to admit, they had a&amp;nbsp;point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=uewX&amp;width=670&amp;height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0"style="overflow:hidden; width:670px; height:525px;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And inflation is a stealth tax which can be used to pay down borrowing.
Normally, creditors demand compensation, in the form of increased rates.
This seems to have stopped happening lately.
There has been some sogginess in yields lately,
but nothing to spook the horses.&amp;nbsp;Yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sleepwalking into a&amp;nbsp;disaster&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ttmygh.podbean.com"&gt;This podcast&lt;/a&gt;, in which Mike Green of Logica Advisors talks to Grant Williams and Bill Fleckenstein is mind-expanding. It contains far too many ideas for me to adequately summarize here, but a few that stuck with me&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;passive funds now dominate the market and are always the marginal buyers (and, in theory,&amp;nbsp;sellers),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;passive funds have never really gone for any significant time as sellers, and it&amp;#8217;s very unclear who they would sell to (buying from active funds is easy, because investors constantly move money from active to passive, including to&amp;nbsp;closet-trackers),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;as bond yields constantly edge down to become negative, structured products that offer capital certainty with equity upside will&amp;nbsp;stop,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fixed interest investments have the characteristic of puts (I&amp;#8217;m not entirely clear about this and will probably have to&amp;nbsp;re-listen),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blackrock has to much&amp;nbsp;power,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stocks really do always go up (until the end game), because there is always more money flowing from active to passive&amp;nbsp;funds,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the strong welfare state in places like Sweden is the result of capital losing access to labour as a result of emigration to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; in the 1870s. The problem today is that labour does not have anywhere equivalent to go to which would cause the 0.01% to capitulate. (Yes, a guy who runs a hedge fund actually said&amp;nbsp;that.)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This episode is only one of several excellent ones. There is a surge in supply of podcasts, because all you need to produce one is a computer with Skype and an internet connection and (preferably) a decent microphone for you and your guest. I guess that&amp;#8217;s why so many podcasts now end with a plea from the presenter to rate the series on Apple Podcasts like an incantation. This, from &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/macro-musings/id1099277290?mt=2"&gt;David Beckworth&amp;#8217;s Macro Musings&lt;/a&gt;, is&amp;nbsp;typical:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I desperately hope that the evolution of podcasts will not follow the same path as that of websites. 
Back in the golden era of the World Wide Web, everyone crafted their own website, often running on their own server, creating both the content and the platform. 
Now big business (Facebook, Twitter) has purged that cottage industry inserted itself between reader and writer and corrupted the process for commercial&amp;nbsp;gain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are starting to hear more about the concept of fiscal dominance &amp;#8212;

&lt;p&gt;We are starting to hear more about the concept of fiscal dominance &amp;#8212;

Various central bankers for years have been pleading with governments to shoulder more of the burden of getting inflation to go up.
Well, now it seems they are getting what they wished for.
It always seemed to me that inflation really doesn&amp;#8217;t start until wages start to rise,
and really that&amp;#8217;s to do with the currency. 
I think that wherever it starts, it will be difficult to contain it to a single country.
My guess it that it probably won&amp;#8217;t start in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; might be a better bet, as we are a small open economy with a floating (sinking)&amp;nbsp;currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vroom&amp;nbsp;Vroom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/12/used-car-truck-supply-and-demand-shocks-wreak-havoc-on-vroom-freshly-ipo-ed-online-used-vehicle-dealer-shares-20-afterhours/"&gt;Wolf doesn&amp;#8217;t like Vroom&lt;/a&gt;. 
But it&amp;#8217;d be mad to short it. The name for the company is great, and it&amp;#8217;s highly likely to get the Robinhooders buying it on the dip. It might even come out of &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@jonahw/dave-portnoy-1-warren-buffett-0-because-stocks-only-go-up-is-it-really-that-easy-af11c462d810"&gt;Davey Day Trader Global&amp;#8217;s scrabble bag&lt;/a&gt;.
Of course eventually it&amp;#8217;s going to go vertically down, but as Keynes (or various others) might have said, &lt;a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/08/08/rational-investment/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is nothing so suicidal as a rational investment policy in an irrational world&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The limits of&amp;nbsp;knowledge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gmo.com/europe/research-library/reasons-not-to-be-cheerful/"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; seems a very good attempt to understand what is behind the extraordinary rise of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; large-cap equity markets.
It has some great analysis. This is an extract, but you should really read the whole thing as this is so much more than the usual trite commentary that passes for analysis of today&amp;#8217;s markets (from both bulls and&amp;nbsp;bears).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I don’t know the answers to these questions, and I am going to refrain from participating in the very popular trend of becoming an armchair epidemiologist or virologist, but I do know that these questions and many others exist. I am also certainly not in the business of trying to second-guess how the future will unfold, but I do know that anyone claiming certainty of foresight is likely to be sorely disappointed. And yet, Mr. Market appears to be doing exactly that.
&lt;p&gt;
Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital often talks about there being two kinds of investors. The two groups can be broadly distinguished by their attitudes toward the future. The first camp is best described as “I know” investors. They think that knowledge of the future course of events such as growth and interest rates is vital to investing. They are confident that such knowledge is attainable, and they “know” they can forecast accurately. They are very comfortable investing on the basis of their views. They freely admit that others will be trying to do the same thing, but their insight is better: it is their edge. Such investors are very popular at dinner parties because they will chatter on about pretty much any subject.
&lt;p&gt;
In contrast, the second group of investors studied at the “I don’t know” school. They hold some very different beliefs about the way you should approach investing. They believe you can’t know the future, and, in fact, you don’t need to know the future in order to invest. Driven by this explicit embrace of uncertainty, they insist on a margin of safety when investing: valuation is front and foremost in their approach. This group is not particularly popular at dinner parties (or maybe it’s just me) as the frequent refrain of “I don’t know” in response to questions is not amazingly stimulating on the conversation front.
&lt;p&gt;
As should be obvious, I firmly identify with the “I don’t know” school, having already stated that I don’t know several times in response to some very important questions raised earlier in this missive. Naturally, when Mr. Market acts with what looks to me like extreme certainty, I get nervous. Even if my caution is completely misplaced, it does not change my view that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; market has priced in all the good news it possibly can, suggesting very little upside from a fundamental point of view.
&lt;p&gt;
Now, of course many will argue that focusing on the fundamentals is a quaint, old-fashioned idea just as they had done during all the great bubbles we have witnessed and studied. They will argue that this is all about the Fed and then blather on about “liquidity creation,” usually in the vaguest of hand-waving fashion. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I freely confess that I don&amp;#8217;t know what is going to happen.
It probably makes my blog more boring, and I am sure it means that I say contradictory things all the time,
but I feel sure that it makes me a better investor than the investor I&amp;#8217;d be if I didn&amp;#8217;t have this humility.
Of course, I have a lot to be humble about, and I certainly don&amp;#8217;t claim to be in the same league as anyone from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMO&lt;/span&gt;, but even I should be able to benefit from knowing my&amp;nbsp;limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing&amp;nbsp;Bell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities up, bonds down, gold down.

I have been mildly bullish on Latin America, because its economies are so commodities-based.
I feel that the currencies will fall, but this will boost their exports and their stockmarkets.
I know that populations are not terribly healthy, and many are obese, which augers badly for Covid,
but fundamentally they have relatively young populations and governments which are notionally democratic, while being very supportive of the rich, and therefore &amp;#8220;business friendly&amp;#8221; (i.e. captured by big business). 
I would much prefer that they were more truly democratic, but I am trying to understand what is the case, not what it should be in a perfect&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds are definitely down, at the long end. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; is stronger than would be expected, &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/08/08/dollar-dominance-is-as-secure-as-american-global-leadership?utm_campaign=the-economist-today&amp;amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_source=salesforce-marketing-cloud&amp;amp;utm_term=2020-08-11&amp;amp;utm_content=article-link-3"&gt;although opinions differ&lt;/a&gt; (this article argues that although the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; isn&amp;#8217;t the military force it once was, it&amp;#8217;s still geopolitically dominant and therefore is the issuer of the global reserve currency by&amp;nbsp;default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Today I&amp;nbsp;Learned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a &lt;a href="https://review.chicagobooth.edu/economics/2017/article/shadow-rate-can-measure-effects-qe#:~:text=When%20the%20federal%20funds%20rate,movements%20of%20various%20benchmark%20data."&gt;shadow rate&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; shadow rate has never been&amp;nbsp;lower:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Longview Economics" src="https://thedailyshot.com/wp-content/uploads/UK-Policy0811040720.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also learned, although I was already vaguely aware of it, &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/11/fed-bought-just-a-smattering-of-corporate-bonds-bond-etfs-tiny-amounts-of-junk-bonds/"&gt;that the Fed does a lot more talking about buying corporate bonds than actually doing it&lt;/a&gt;. 
It certainly annoys the hell out of ordinary mortals that the Fed is helping Tim Cook finance the buybacks that save his stock awards from diluting Apple&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing&amp;nbsp;Bell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another classic risk-on day. 
All equity indexes (that I noticed) were up. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; is unstoppable, up 2.5%, but the others are close behind.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; is down to 23 (the future&amp;#8217;s price), implying a tiny realized vol.
The long bond is down, gold and non-soft commodities are up (a bit).

&lt;p&gt;Although everyone and his pet monkey is writing about how inflation is around the corner,
we haven&amp;#8217;t seen it yet, and most of them have been saying that for years anyway.
&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/42e1a1f6-90cb-4246-b0a7-4e4827879cbd"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt;, 
by Michael Strobaek, global chief investment officer at Credit Suisse,
argues that until governments get what he calls &amp;#8220;fiscal dominance,&amp;#8221;
we will not see inflation.
The theory is that central banks are cautious and that unless the government is forcing them to monetize
treasury financing, they will not let inflation get out of hand.
I certainly think that money will have to get into the hands of consumers
for countries to experience consumer price inflation (as opposed to into the hands of bankers and industrialists, to experience financial asset price inflation).
This is best done via tax cuts or handouts (maybe Universal Basic Income), which can be done only by governments (or central bankers willing to ignore their mandates).
I think that inflation may tick up, especially as the Fed seems to set on letting inflation run hot for a bit,
after seeing it run cold for decades,
but I am far from sure we&amp;#8217;ll see the sort of runaway inflation that Peter Schiff talks about.
The market seems to agree, as precious metals are marooned at current price levels,
and certainly not pricing in roaring&amp;nbsp;inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know what&amp;#8217;s going to happen to inflation. If I did I&amp;#8217;d be too rich to bother typing this post.
However, the market is not quite aligned in its view with Mr Strobaek. The ten-year breakeven is now 1.6%, and the five-year, five-year forward expectation rate is similar &lt;em&gt;and both are risking quite strongly&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Morning&amp;nbsp;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely risk off. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; down to 24 (which means that realized inflation might be in the low teens).
The usual pattern of other price moves: equities up, metals down, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; up (pausing a bit this morning), 
sovereign bonds down. Gilts look weak and heading&amp;nbsp;lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2020/08/10/warning-to-the-compounder-bros/"&gt;Kuppy nails it again&lt;/a&gt;.
Basically, as a fund manager, you can&amp;#8217;t afford not to be long fraud.
The odd one (Wirecard, Luckin Coffee, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NMC&lt;/span&gt; Health) get caught out, but loads of frauds and near frauds,
at least to the extent of making undeliverable promises to shareholders, live on.
As Kuppy&amp;nbsp;says, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the twenty years I’ve been reading investor letters, I have never once seen someone boast that they’ve invested in a terrible business, with corrupt and incompetent management. Oddly, those tend to be the sorts of stocks that have the best upside as minor improvements can dramatically impact the future value. I’m not arguing that you should go look for D companies that could become Cs (though I do my fair share of that). Rather, I would argue strongly that the valuation gap between A and B companies has never been wider during my career. B’s are still genuinely good businesses—just maybe not software&amp;nbsp;good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, of course, the most A of A companies is $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt;. Faultless in its execution, but maybe, just maybe, it&amp;#8217;s excellence could now finally be fully in the&amp;nbsp;price.&lt;/p&gt;

When Milton Friedman was in his prime, money was currency, and bank deposits. Now credit card balances must qualify as what he would call &amp;#8220;close substitutes for money.&amp;#8221;

There is something more to come out from this scandal.
The thing I don&amp;#8217;t understand is how a very high profile German company (and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DAX&lt;/span&gt; constituent!) could have got away with such brazen fraud for so long.
It has to be more than lazy auditors.

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s too hot to follow the markets in this weather.
I would say that risk assets were generally a fraction higher, almost certainly driven by some statement by the Treasury to the effect that they&amp;#8217;d continue supporting markets.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; was down a bit, but other &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; and world markets generally up ~0.25%.
Most  commodities higher, including the hydrocarbon complex, except &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt; which was down after a charging higher last week.
European sovereigns drifting higher, as the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt; keeps the presses&amp;nbsp;rolling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see a lot of press coverage of gold (and a bit of silver) and the inevitable return to discussion of …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Morning&amp;nbsp;call&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The markets are mainly dead, with a couple of&amp;nbsp;exceptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silver has caught fire, overtaking gold in percentage increase&amp;nbsp;terms,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Turkish Lira seems in deep&amp;nbsp;trouble. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see a lot of press coverage of gold (and a bit of silver) and the inevitable return to discussion of inflation.
&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2895520f-5d23-4add-a431-7cc954fb78a4"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; pointed out that the yield on TIPs is now negative, i.e. investors expect real yields to turn negative.
I don&amp;#8217;t follow &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TIPS&lt;/span&gt; prices, but looking at &lt;a href="https://koyfin.com/s/xdBKivOUvy"&gt;a likely looking &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TIPS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; price series&lt;/a&gt; it would seem that the markets expectation of inflation is endlessly rising.
It&amp;#8217;s hard to take a market position on this: maybe an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; is the best way, but it seems unnatural to buy something which costs money to own. 
I wish I had a crystal ball, but if press coverage is any measure of inflation being about to break out,
it is going to&amp;nbsp;happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity indexes area  shade lower, but they don&amp;#8217;t seem to stay down for long, which is not surprising given the tsunami of liquidity that is being unleashed by the central&amp;nbsp;banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I&amp;#8217;m&amp;nbsp;reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenlight Investors Letter, which can be found by googling or &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4364188-greenlight-capital-q2-2020-letter"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, is worth a look.
Einhorn is keen on $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BHF&lt;/span&gt;, Brighthouse Financial, which, as far as I can tell, 
is not related to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; company of a similar name.
As widely reported, he&amp;#8217;s convinced that inflation is coming and that $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; is a fraud.
I believe he&amp;#8217;s right, but I also believe that it could be a very long time before it&amp;#8217;s possible to make money out of these insights, if ever.
I don&amp;#8217;t spend a lot of time on Yahoo Finance, but they have a lot of stuff. They have the earnings call transcript for Greenlight](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/edited-transcript-glre-oq-earnings-233910148.html), which is more than is available on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; or Reuters (that I can find,&amp;nbsp;free).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/06/end-of-qe-week-8-feds-assets-fall-by-4-billion-for-the-week-down-224-billion-since-june-10/"&gt;Wolf Richer has more to say about the Fed and inflation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing&amp;nbsp;Bell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; seems to have sagged against everything.
Equities mixed. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; down.
Commodities down (in spite of a weak dollar: what&amp;#8217;s happening?).
Summary: no clear direction.

&lt;p&gt;Risk on day, which really means currency debasement day. 
I didn&amp;#8217;t check every asset class, but commodities generally up.
Bonds and equities pretty flat.

&lt;h2&gt;Trading&amp;nbsp;ideas&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Risk on day, which really means currency debasement day.

&lt;h2&gt;Trading&amp;nbsp;ideas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/david-einhorn-betting-inflation-174040566.html"&gt;David Einhorn&lt;/a&gt;, who is very sceptical about $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; thinks that inflation will take off.
He has taken a direct exposure to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPI&lt;/span&gt; via inflation swaps, a strategy not available to the retail investor.
The article points out that simply shorting bonds does not work when the Fed is buying them hand over&amp;nbsp;fist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting nugget is that he&amp;#8217;s buying an air freight company, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAWW&lt;/span&gt;. The idea is simple: most freight is carried in the bellies of passenger planes. 
If these are not flying, then specialist air freight firms will clean up. In theory!!
And, of course, the stock is up 250% from its lows, so it&amp;#8217;s probably not the right time to buy,
as how difficult can it be to convert a passenger jet to flying freight? 
It&amp;#8217;s not as though we have a shortage of baggage handling capacity or&amp;nbsp;pilots!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be bullish on Natural Gas. It&amp;#8217;s a clean fuel (relative to oil or coal), it&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CO2&lt;/span&gt; footprint is smaller,
it&amp;#8217;s easily transportable in pipes or tankers (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, the latter are pricey compared to oil tankers, but many exist),
&amp;#8220;clean&amp;#8221; energy tends to be very intermittent, and it seems to me that the only source of power that is sufficiently flexible to close the gap is gas (and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CCGT&lt;/span&gt; generation in particular). 
However, &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/05/us-crude-oil-production-plunged-most-ever-natural-gas-followed-the-great-american-oil-gas-bust-phase-2/"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; makes the case that as soon as though production of gas looks as though it will get into balance with demand, cheap funds flow in and wreck everything.
Maybe this time is different, and the Private Equity guys got burned once too often.
We shall&amp;nbsp;see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ask not for whom the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMF&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;toils&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/04/why-wall-street-loves-serial-defaulter-argentina/"&gt;It works for Wall Street&lt;/a&gt;, not for you, for the Argentinian taxpayer (although, I guess, he has a slight&amp;nbsp;benefit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing&amp;nbsp;bell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt; market never closes, but the equities markets do, thank God.
No great moves, but the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AUD&lt;/span&gt; seems to be going up against everything. 
This may be explained by a strong rally in many commodities, especially silver, which was up 7.8% in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; terms.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVNA&lt;/span&gt; shot up insanely, although I read that it cratered a bit after hours.
These fraud stocks need to be avoided in this market as they are like unexploded bombs.
&lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5e8606e2ce89552d175a9ba4"&gt;My list is here&lt;/a&gt;, although I don&amp;#8217;t know that any are actual frauds: they are just stocks which some commentators have suggested have some sort of fraud going on. 
I have absolutely no idea whether the suggestions are true or not: I am certainly not going to trade on the basis of such a&amp;nbsp;suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Worth listening&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to &lt;a href="https://ttmygh.podbean.com"&gt;Grant Williams talking to Michael Green&lt;/a&gt;.
Green&amp;#8217;s thesis is that markets have changed because of the rise of passive investing.
The massive flows into passive funds changes totally the way that prices respond to flows.
One thing I had not realized is that stock borrowing is now much, much cheaper than it used to be,
because these huge passive funds that charge essentially zero management fees &lt;strong&gt;make all their money by lending out the stock they own&lt;/strong&gt;.
Green made some interesting points about option trading and pricing, and the relationship between option pricing and the Efficient Market Hypothesis. 
He also had some interesting comments on Jim Simon&amp;#8217;s biggest problem running the Medallion Fund,
but you have to listen to the whole thing because it&amp;#8217;s packed with&amp;nbsp;revelations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really think this idea is important. Maybe not quite as much as Mike Green does, 
but I think that the monotonic price behaviour of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; is a consequence of lock-step buying of all stocks as
investors&amp;#8217; money moves from active to passive (as boomers cash out and millenials save more). 
The relative price behaviour of stocks is a function of the shape of the supply schedule for stock.
The low free float of stocks like $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMZN&lt;/span&gt; must steepen this curve.
The other factor, of course, is stock buybacks.
With $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt;, one of the most cash-generative companies on the planet, endlessly issuing debt to fund buybacks,
(to neutralize the dilution that stock awards to insiders would otherwise cause), it&amp;#8217;s hardly surprising that the stock price never goes down.
It really doesn&amp;#8217;t make any difference what it&amp;#8217;s P/E ratio&amp;nbsp;is.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 5th August 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-5th-august-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-05T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-08-05:/market-notes-5th-august-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t Fight the&amp;nbsp;Fed&lt;/h2&gt;

This is more or less the summary of a series of podcasts with Grant Williams, Bill Fleckenstein and others.
They are all fantastic, but to really have your mind blown, listen to &lt;a href="https://ttmygh.podbean.com/e/teg_0002/"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; which features the legendary Lord of the Dark Matter (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOTM&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to the podcasts with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOTM&lt;/span&gt; and with Mark Cohodes. The key personnel  as far as I&amp;#8217;m concerned&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AlderLaneeggs"&gt;Mark&amp;nbsp;Cohodes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big question is &amp;#8220;How will it all end?&amp;#8221; Nobody really knows, but nobody thought that stocks would ever go&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Seriously: what is the point of&amp;nbsp;analysts?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cjGs7JcGTH"&gt;This post&lt;img src="https://tme2.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/06661eb5819aa286d902625d5fc84b35" width=600 style="float:right"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows what a rigged market this is. 
Even though Covid-19 was a bolt from the blue, the vast majority of stocks beat estimates on&amp;nbsp;earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Today&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;Markets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities up almost across the board, miners too.
Metals most. Even softs are picking up momentum, although soybeans are down a tiny fraction.
Nearly all global equities are up, some by nearly 1%.
&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/05/adp-private-payroll-growth-at-167000-in-july-well-below-expectations.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ADP&lt;/span&gt; payrolls are very disappointing&lt;/a&gt; but this is probably the reason that equities are up: more unemployment leads to more money printing.
Not coincidentally, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; is down 0.82% as I write.
Even the yield curve responded, a tiny bit. The steepener is on! (But don&amp;#8217;t bet the ranch: in fact don&amp;#8217;t take anything I say as advice about anything.)
This is a very dangerous environment to be short any real assets or long any money assets.
To make money, your asset has to fall in price faster than money loses its value.
It&amp;#8217;s like hitting a target that is not only moving, but accelerating,&amp;nbsp;erratically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;and&amp;nbsp;Finally&lt;/h2&gt;

Even European bank stocks are rallying, in spite of a 12% decline in European &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;. Is a failing economy good news for banks who have lent to businesses out&amp;nbsp;there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A story caught my eye: &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gm-evgo/gm-partners-with-evgo-to-add-2700-new-fast-chargers-in-u-s-idUSKCN24W2JQ"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GM&lt;/span&gt; plans to roll out a charging network of its own&lt;/a&gt;. With a 2022 forecast P/E of 4.4x, I think &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GM&lt;/span&gt; looks better value than &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; from my point of view. 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GM&lt;/span&gt; owns &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_%28autonomous_vehicle%29"&gt;Cruise&lt;/a&gt; which is a serious player in the autonomous driving space.
If markets can&amp;#8217;t stay down (because &amp;#8230; Fed), it seems logical to go long promising&amp;nbsp;companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese equities are down a bit, because of the fuss over TikTok. It&amp;#8217;s about to be bought by Microsoft, because it&amp;#8217;s currently Chinese owned. The ban is a piece of signalling in my view.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BABA&lt;/span&gt; (Alibaba) is up, though. I guess &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; investors are relaxed about being long a stock that has the Chinese politburo standing behind it.&amp;nbsp;Still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From Wolf&amp;nbsp;Richer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/03/rents-swoon-in-san-francisco-other-expensive-cities-and-tx-ok-oil-patch-y-y-but-23-cities-with-red-hot-double-digit-rent-increases/"&gt;Severe stress in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; rental market&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a href="https://www.idiosyncraticwhisk.com/2020/07/a-miracle-homeownership-boom.html"&gt;There is something very odd going on in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; real estate market&lt;/a&gt; according to Kevin Erdmann. 
Home ownership, as a proportion of all properties, has shot up 2.6%. Something is very fishy: Erdmann doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to be able to explain this, which means that I don&amp;#8217;t have a hope. Somehow, I feel that it would have more to do with rental properties disappearing, or being put up for sale for owner occupation, than to do with buyers suddenly having lots of money to move out of rental&amp;nbsp;accommodation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/31/average-age-of-cars-trucks-on-the-road-sets-record-will-jump-during-pandemic-as-new-vehicle-sales-plunge-to-1970s-level/"&gt;Cars are lasting longer&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ve suspected this for a while, just through casual observation of what&amp;#8217;s around me as I travel around. The article is about the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, but the same effect must be playing out here.
And people are driving less. This has to be good for drivers and for everyone else. 
The terrible planning system we have in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; might just be saved by workers not needing to be in the centre of London, whose world-beating productivity was probably never about it&amp;#8217;s location but more about the fact that most of the best graduates end up working for firms based there after&amp;nbsp;university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Close of&amp;nbsp;play&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t bothered to check, but from Twitter I gather that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; has powered ahead yet again.
The Fed balance sheet grew more than expected, which might not be unrelated.
Mondays always seem to be risk on, but generally risk appetite deflates through the rest of the week.

It&amp;#8217;s worth the price of a&amp;nbsp;Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Credit last week added $4.4bn to $6.917 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TN&lt;/span&gt;, with a 47-week gain of $3.195 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TN&lt;/span&gt;. Over the past year, Fed Credit expanded $3.165 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TN&lt;/span&gt;, or 84.4%. Fed Credit inflated $4.106 Trillion, or 146%, over the past 403 weeks. Elsewhere, Fed holdings for foreign owners of Treasury, Agency Debt gained $5.1 billion last week to $3.407 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TN&lt;/span&gt;. &amp;#8220;Custody holdings&amp;#8221; were down $55.5bn, or 1.6%,&amp;nbsp;y-o-y.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M2 (narrow) &amp;#8220;money&amp;#8221; supply fell $70.2bn last week to $18.318 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TN&lt;/span&gt;, with an unprecedented 21-week gain of $2.811 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TN&lt;/span&gt;. &amp;#8220;Narrow money&amp;#8221; surged $3.448 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TN&lt;/span&gt;, or 23.2%, over the past year. For the week, Currency increased $6.5bn. Total Checkable Deposits jumped $55.9bn, while Savings Deposits slumped $113.9bn. Small Time Deposits declined $6.9bn. Retail Money Funds fell&amp;nbsp;$11.9bn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total money market fund assets declined $18.3bn to $4.570 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TN&lt;/span&gt;. Total money funds surged $1.292 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TN&lt;/span&gt; y-o-y, or&amp;nbsp;39.4%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Commercial Paper slipped $1.6bn to $1.019 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TN&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CP&lt;/span&gt; was down $133bn, or 11.5%&amp;nbsp;year-over-year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My&amp;nbsp;thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey seems to be heading in the direction of hyperinflation. 
A country on the borders of Europe being in such a terrible place is not going to play out well.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; has paid Turkey to keep a lot of refugees within its borders, to save us giving them asylum,
I&amp;#8217;m not sure that&amp;#8217;s going to be sustainable.

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s oppressively hot in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;: not something I often say.
The main driver of all price moves today is the dollar, which continues to sag.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; is down 0.46%, which is pushing all other prices up, at least in commodities.
Equities are getting a boost, but mainly bouncing back from the violent falls yesterday:
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESTX50&lt;/span&gt; is up 1.2%, but still well down on the week.
Quarterly economic data seems to be confirming what (surely) we all knew perfectly well:
that the Covid lockdown had caused major damage to developed economies.
The Far East equities seem becalmed. Normally, a weak dollar is great for the Hang Seng, 
but maybe these times are different.
The bad economic headlines from yesterday seem to have been somewhat forgotten by the bond market.
The yields have ticked up across the curve, but slightly more at the long end, giving me renewed hope that there will be some steepening.
Back in the eighties, regular newspapers were full of discussions about through what channel inflation came into the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. I remember being persuaded that the exchange rate was very important, at least for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, which is a fairly open economy. Of course, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; is a relatively closed economy, so can stand a substantial depreciation of its currency without suffering much price&amp;nbsp;inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An article in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; today was arguing that a weak dollar translates into higher asset prices of (nearly) all classes, but especially emerging market equities. I can see the logic, but I am not going to rush out to buy&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silver and gold are getting more airtime.
Quite a few commentators are in effect saying &amp;#8220;would you go long this far into a rally?&amp;#8221;
The problem is that investors seem increasingly reckless, and have so few appealing alternatives, as longs but are yet to see the possibilities of going short (which, to be fair, nearly always implictly involves going long dollars which is not a comfortable positionto be&amp;nbsp;in).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fleck is long Alamos Gold ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AGI&lt;/span&gt;). Gold miners have done well lately, and Fleck knows what he&amp;#8217;s talking about when it comes to selecting miners. Might be worth a punt (&lt;em&gt;not investment advice&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5ee9e268769b5613837afb5c"&gt;My list of miners&lt;/a&gt; is available for all to see. The dispersion in weekly performance is really something. This suggests that diversifying by holding a basket of these would be worth doing, but only for sound companies. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SILV&lt;/span&gt; looks&amp;nbsp;tempting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Rates chart" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/rates_going_up_p.png"&gt; from the Daily&amp;nbsp;Shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Science&amp;nbsp;factoid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calico cats (and tortoishells) are almost invariably female. 
The study of the genetics of calico cats seems to have been going since 1948.
The skin of a calico cat is a mosaic of cells some of which express on X chromosome, the others expressing the other. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calico_cat"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; has the details. 
I learned this from &lt;a href="https://www.thenakedscientists.com/podcasts/naked-genetics/female-mosaicism-stronger-sex"&gt;this excellent podcast&lt;/a&gt;. 
Women really are the stronger sex: at any age their chance of dying is about 20% less than the chance of a male of the same age. The difference is the extra genetic weaponry in their spare X&amp;nbsp;chromosome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Words of wisdom (from Charlie&amp;nbsp;Munger)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The big money is not in the selling, but in the&amp;nbsp;waiting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing&amp;nbsp;bell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMZN&lt;/span&gt; up ~10%. Wonders will never cease. 
Generally equities up, commodities too (including precious metals).
Yields flat.
Dollar up against most major&amp;nbsp;currencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; short looks a bit over extended. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; future seems to be going up today. 
Probably a reversal, but I can understand the bull thesis.
As &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; rises, commodity prices fall, in unison. This seems to have happened today, including precious metals.

&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; short looks a bit over extended. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; future seems to be going up today. 
Probably a reversal, but I can understand the bull thesis.
As &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; rises, commodity prices fall, in unison. This seems to have happened today, including precious metals.
&lt;a href="https://themarketear.com/posts/cYOCwZL9dy"&gt;This post from The (excellent) Market Ear&lt;/a&gt; suggests that short &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; may have gone on too long. 
The main point it makes, though, is that the Fed is, compared to the size of the pool of bonds it&amp;#8217;s buying in, doing the least of the Fed, the BoE and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt;. However, the long dated rates don&amp;#8217;t seem to be rising&amp;nbsp;much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the intra-day swings seem higher, maybe because the breadth (propertion of the market moving together) has dropped.
The Fed announcement yesterday doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to have had the (presumably) desired effect of spiking the market&amp;nbsp;higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6cc1b28b-940c-4c7b-886d-a928d56b3efd"&gt;Diana Choyleva argues that this time is different for the Chinese stock market&lt;/a&gt;. I am not so convinced.
There must be a ton of malinvestment in China, 
and converting a trillion &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; debt to equity cannot be bullish for share prices,
unless I&amp;#8217;ve misunderstood something fundamental about supply and demand.
(Although I&amp;#8217;d be the first to admit that shares are not widgets, in terms of the price vs supply&amp;nbsp;behaviour.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Economic&amp;nbsp;thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b6ad9b99-d75f-4ef9-9a88-852ce0de5f6b"&gt;This article by Robin Harding&lt;/a&gt; argues that the Central Banks had no alternative to the policies they carried out since the 90&amp;#8217;s, and that any negative collateral damage was preferable to allowing a real deep recession to arise from too tight a monetary policy.
The comments are more or less unanimous in disagreeing and several imply some sort of charm offensive by the CBs to get journalists to defend their actions in print. 
I wouldn&amp;#8217;t go as far as this, but it&amp;#8217;s gratifying that most of the commentators are of the opinion that CBs have made life a lot worse for the young.
It seems to me that if we don&amp;#8217;t change &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CB&lt;/span&gt; policies, we need to introduce fiscal policies to compensate losers. 
The obvious policy is much higher capital taxes.
Any hint that this policy might be enacted would these will generate a very intense lobbying effort, so I am not&amp;nbsp;hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched the final episode of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; documentary series about the Murdoch dynasty last night.
He is a huge beneficiary of the desire of corporates to interfere in the political&amp;nbsp;process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, but plenty of people get rich by investing in&amp;nbsp;them&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2020/07/28/my-favorite-ponzi-scheme/"&gt;Kuppy argues&lt;/a&gt; that although Bitcoins are worth nothing (obvs) it is quite possible that one can make a ton of money by buying them. 
He talks about charts, fashion, liquidity of the asset, compares it to gold etc. etc.
I don&amp;#8217;t know. There are an infinite perfectly viable substitutes for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; (i.e. the &amp;#8216;alt-coins&amp;#8217; aka the &amp;#8216;shitcoins&amp;#8217;). However, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; is the one that people seem to have faith in, and that&amp;#8217;s what five pound notes have but Monopoly money does not have (outside a game), so it&amp;#8217;s not to be sneezed at.
Would I buy $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBTC&lt;/span&gt;? Probably not, but at least I&amp;#8217;d consider it. 
Two things worth considering though:
* Kuppy is probably only writing this now because he wants to close his own position (or go short), 
* Ponzi schemes can collapse faster than you can close your position, and liquidity can evaporate quicker than liquid nitrogen in a&amp;nbsp;furnace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about Ponzi schemes, &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/29/thezoohasgonenuts-kodak-after-crypto-scheme-in-2018-caused-its-stock-to-surge-300-before-recrashing-gets-trump-pump-worth-2190-before-recrashing/"&gt;Wolf nails it&lt;/a&gt; in his account of what has been going on with Eastman Kodak ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KODK&lt;/span&gt;). &amp;#8220;Nauseating&amp;#8221; doesn&amp;#8217;t even come close to what is going on&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;India&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narendra Modi has been a divisive prime minister of India. 
He has increasingly relied on mobilizing his base, rather than fixing the economy, to get re-elected.
This approach is not good for the economy of the country, a point made by Gavekal Research, referenced in &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampesek/2020/07/29/indias-covid-19-fallout-collides-with-a-shaky-economy/#72cae9123684"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;.
The level of infections is extremely high, so maybe India will the first country to hit herd immunity.
It&amp;#8217;s a place worth watching.
The emerging market stockmarket I am most bearish about is China&amp;#8217;s (including &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s). 
I suspect that most Chinese stocks listed in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; have serious deficiencies in their statutory reporting,
but it&amp;#8217;s extremely dangerous to short a Ponzi scheme, as recent stock market developments have&amp;nbsp;shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Late afternoon&amp;nbsp;report&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing much changed from this morning, except precious metals have retraced more.
Natural gas &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; oil have lurched down, and brought down the tankers with it. 
This probably has a lot to do with Q2 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; dropping by 33% (annualized).
This drop in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; provoked a rare and dramatic plunge in the Nasdaq index, which was down 0.12% as I type this.
It&amp;#8217;s hard to remember when the index dropped by so much, but I&amp;#8217;m sure the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PPT&lt;/span&gt; will make sure it is suitably pumped up overnight when volume is thin. 
The figures above were based on the nearby future&amp;#8217;s price. Exposure to the index for most retail traders is via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QQQ&lt;/span&gt; which, reassuringly, is still green on the day. Praise be the Fed! 
(More seriously) the explanation is that the expected drop in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; was a bit worse, and the dollar is still going down, which inflates the dollar revenue figure for the FAANGs without hitting their (dollar denominated) cost base (much). Firms like Google must have something like the most geographically diversified income base on the&amp;nbsp;planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oddly, compared to other countries&amp;#8217; reporting conventions, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; economic figures are all reported as an annualized figure (i.e. the actual quarterly drop was multiplied by four to come up with the 33% drop). &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/30/no-gdp-didnt-plunge-32-9-in-q2-it-plunged-a-still-terrible-9-5-time-to-kill-annual-rates/"&gt;Wolf is good on this too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten year &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury yields are down. Yet the stockmarket is up. What&amp;#8217;s going on? One of them is mis-reading the economic situation.

&lt;p&gt;Gold, silver, copper all flat.
Lumber futures (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LB&lt;/span&gt;) are having a terrific run up. I think this is definitely an inflation signal.
Faint stirrings of a yield curve steepening in Treasuries (I live in hope!).
The downtrend in China equities looking increasingly established. 
I&amp;#8217;ve been bearish about the Hang Seng for a considerable time, but it&amp;#8217;s been very strong this year, 
for reasons beyond me (endless pumping of new hope for &amp;#8220;Phase 1&amp;#8221; trade deal?).
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; equities insanely resilient. Two consecutive down days for the Nasdaq was remarkable enough to produce a headline the other day. What other index has ever been like it?
Some negativity about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; banks in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;, although it&amp;#8217;s hard to see any banks doing well in this situation.
Dollar is fairly flat, but gently declining against currencies of countries which have a chance of maintaining a balance of payments surplus. I fancy Canadian dollars, personally, but the Aussie dollar is doing fairly well. 
I prefer Canada because I don&amp;#8217;t like the China exposure implicit in Australian&amp;nbsp;assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5cfb2253-40ec-4ef3-9c1a-94b8a7bf2307"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; says that 57% of &amp;#8220;slum dwellers&amp;#8221; in Mumbai have antibodies to Covid-19. It seems hard to believe that in the long run the whole global population will not end up having been exposed. The article has a fairly negative tone, but to me it&amp;#8217;s encouraging. 
There are reasons to fear the &amp;#8220;fat tail&amp;#8221; risk in pandemics, and it is conceivable that a disease emerges which is slow acting, very lethal, and fantastically infections (a sort of combination of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt; before anti-retrovirals and measles). The steps required to stop such a pathogen will be unimaginably damaging to the economy. I still suspect that we might decide not to do much about it collectively, but that is a political decision&amp;nbsp;(unfortunately).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lumber&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a long-term chart of lumber prices. It&amp;#8217;s very volatile. It might be easier to interpret if it were deflated by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPI&lt;/span&gt;. I can see why the expectation is that it will come down, but maybe not until it&amp;#8217;s gone a lot higher.
What is clear is that recessions make lumber cheaper: hardly a blinding revelation. 
I assume that a forest owner who foresees a steep increase in the price of lumber in the future just leaves his trees in the ground. If they all do this, the price will react, à la rational expectations theory, and the price will spike today. We will&amp;nbsp;see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Coal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, we had an open fire, the fuel for which was offcuts of wood, and coal: this is not an experience shared by many children in the west these days.
&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/28/why-theres-no-hope-for-coal-consumption-plunged-to-multi-decade-lows/"&gt;Coal is becoming increasingly irrelevant as a fuel&lt;/a&gt;.
An exception might be metallurgical coal, which is specifically for blast furnaces and may have had its price depressed &amp;#8216;unfairly.&amp;#8217; $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HCC&lt;/span&gt; has a lot of the stuff, but given that operating blast furnaces will increasingly be found only in China, it looks a risky thing to bet on. It&amp;#8217;s a pity, because $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HCC&lt;/span&gt; has &amp;#8216;deep&amp;nbsp;value&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Afternoon&amp;nbsp;wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day is mildly risk on still.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; is down, about 0.3%,
$ES_F is up about 0.8%,
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; is down a bit,
there is a faint trace of yield curve steeping.
Gold and silver are becalmed, miners down.
Tankers are up a bit, without much movement in crude ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CL&lt;/span&gt; futures up 0.4%).
Nat. gas (future) is up over 3%. 
Euro area banks are down 1%.
The worst is yet to come, probably when all the head traders are on vacation in the&amp;nbsp;Hamptons.&lt;/p&gt;

Twitter saying that the Plunge Protection Team had been deployed. 
Various news about the Moderna vaccine having some promising properties.
Gold was up, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; was down. Copper was up. Go figure!
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; was pretty flat, although &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHF&lt;/span&gt; was up against it.
The 10-year was up a tad, but nothing&amp;nbsp;much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, a calmish day, with stocks looking a bit over extended but inflation hedges looking good.
Tomorrow is a big day: three of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; bunch have results. It could be&amp;nbsp;volatile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Non-trading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not generally a great fan of N N Taleb, but he had some sensible things to say about the pandemic when he was interviewed by Russ Roberts on a recent Econtalk,  &lt;a href="https://www.econtalk.org/nassim-nicholas-taleb-on-the-pandemic/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
He was good about how you need to take as much risk as possible without hitting the &amp;#8220;absorbing barrier&amp;#8221; (death).
I can&amp;#8217;t decide if he&amp;#8217;s a genius or a charlatan: a bit of both, probably.
His essential point seemed to be that you have to take risk to make money, but you must make sure the distribution of outcomes is such that you never go bankrupt.
This amounts to saying that you need to put in protective stops, or buy puts, or do something that puts a ceiling on your losses.
Buffett talks about the most important rule of investing is to never lose money, and the second most important rule of investing is never to forget the most important rule.
Although this is memorable, it&amp;#8217;s not really very practical. 
The Kelly analysis suggests something more sophisticated: having a utility function that suitably weights &amp;#8220;fat tail&amp;#8221; losses high enough to force suitable capital-conserving trading&amp;nbsp;strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Politics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; is again asking if it&amp;#8217;s sensible to encourage leverage via the tax system, by making the (risk adjusted) after-tax cost of equity capital higher than the corresponding cost of debt capital. Clearly, it isn&amp;#8217;t. Clearly, the government is not going to change the tax rules. 
Just like carried interest is still a thing.
Just like tariffs and stamp duty are still things.
Just like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZIRP&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIRP&lt;/span&gt; are still things. 
Because these policies transfer resources from unfavoured groups to favoured&amp;nbsp;groups.&lt;/p&gt;

This is an interesting departure (as far as I&amp;#8217;m aware) for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; in that it created the article by reading the comments left on the website.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; comments are often of a high quality, from individuals who know what they are talking about.
It&amp;#8217;s a great pity that they have zero visibility in the printed version, which is probably still the most common way of consuming the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;.

It&amp;#8217;s not amazing, but it&amp;#8217;s pretty clear about predicting a really bad jobs number this week.
The only issue is how the (equity) market takes&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as today&amp;#8217;s markets are concerned, precious metals are up, the yield curve seems to be flattening, other commodities are not doing very much and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt; is fairly subdued, although the dollar continues to trend down.
It seems odd to see commodities (well, money-like commodities) so strong against flat equity and bond markets.
Dr Copper is not giving a clear prognosis, but he certainly doesn&amp;#8217;t see the economy returning to robust health for some considerable time, even with China putting the pedal to the metal in infrastructure&amp;nbsp;spending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mood today is that the sheer scale of money creation will end up forcing equity markets higher, 
in spite of their insane over-valuation. However, I can barely convince myself. 
The famous Robinhood traders (or &lt;em&gt;bagholders&lt;/em&gt; as they would probably be referred to in the dealing rooms of the City) may just keep the markets trending higher for a few more weeks but it&amp;#8217;s hard to see them higher still in a year&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar&amp;#8217;s weakness is not a certainty. Well, that&amp;#8217;s an information-free sentence, but what I mean is that as &lt;a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/tech-stocks-tanked-blame-it-on-the-value-of-the-dollar-51595638215"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; points out, with pessimism about the dollar hitting all-time highs, we might be due for a dollar rally.
This would then be good for Amazon and co.&amp;nbsp;I &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting view, put forward by Grant Williams, is that the reason that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt;+ has done so well is not that their fortunes have much to do with technology, but that they are all still largely under the control of their founders &lt;em&gt;and the float of their shares in issue is very low.&lt;/em&gt; The combination of being in an index (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NQ&lt;/span&gt;), and having a low float (or just being a hot stock and &amp;#8230;) is explosive. This is certainly consistent with poor performance from &amp;#8220;old&amp;#8221; tech companies, like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IBM&lt;/span&gt;, which presumably have a high float.
The interesting thing is that really stocks like $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;INTC&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TMC&lt;/span&gt; are relatively cheap, at least compared to $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FB&lt;/span&gt;, which is really just an advertising company.
I&amp;#8217;d be interested in knowing how to screen stocks for high insider&amp;nbsp;ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day finished much as it started, except there was a huge ramp towards the end for Robinhood type stocks.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; jumped 9%. You can see the list &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/1287824560621051905"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; courtesy of Zerohedge. I keep &lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5ee0b537c8647bc77bd4d9fb"&gt;my own list&lt;/a&gt; of these kind of stocks.
At some point they are going down a lot, but for the moment I am just holding onto my capital and battening down the hatches.

&lt;p&gt;The Kelly Criterion tells you how much of your capital you should risk on a single bet, e.g. on a horse in a race.

&lt;p&gt;The Kelly Criterion tells you how much of your capital you should risk on a single bet, e.g. on a horse in a race.
Kelly, in his original paper, contrived a rather odd situation where you actually have an &amp;#8220;edge,&amp;#8221; i.e. the expected payoff of your bet is positive. 
The original paper has been plundered by various investment bank quants to inform their investing style: to be frank, it seems to relate to investing more than betting at a race track.
In fact, the original paper was mainly about optimising information flow through a noisy channel.
Kelly was a colleague of Claude Shannon, a superstar for those of us who are interested in great scientists and mathematicians, and the originator of the concept of entropy in the context of communication&amp;nbsp;theory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelly&amp;#8217;s criterion, as applied to investing, is equivalent to making the assumption of a logarithmic utility function. Roughly speaking, the utility an investor derives from a given amount of wealth is proportional to the logarithm of the amount of wealth he has.
Logarithms have some pleasing properties: if your wealth grows exponentially, the utility you derive from your growing wealth grows linearly. In other words, both Jeff Bezos and a homeless person derive the same satisfaction from finding out that their spending power has gone up by five percent, even though it takes many orders of magnitude more dollars for Bezos than for the hobo. 
This, of course, is the justification for progressive taxation and re-distributive policies but this post is about economics, not&amp;nbsp;policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the log function has these pleasing properties, it&amp;#8217;s far from obvious why it should be preferred to other convex functions. I am not the first person to think about this: the anonymous author of &lt;a href="https://atrivialknot.wordpress.com"&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt; has though about this and written up his thoughts &lt;a href="https://atrivialknot.wordpress.com/2015/ 11/07/logarithmic-utility-and-the-kelly-strategy/"&gt;about the very topic&lt;/a&gt;. 
He seems to conclude that the choice is&amp;nbsp;arbitrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Kelly&amp;#8217;s paper seems to be terribly important, I don&amp;#8217;t know anyone who actually uses it as a guideline for action. The problem is that the &amp;#8220;bet size&amp;#8221; is determined by the size of one&amp;#8217;s edge: the extent to which the bookie&amp;#8217;s odds are mis-priced. This is (obviously) impossible to measure, or even estimate with any confidence. 
In fact, there is a huge body of academic literature which supports the view that in large, liquid markets the edge one has is zero, which leads to the familiar &amp;#8220;modern&amp;#8221; portfolio theory conclusion that betting on a particular stock is a mugs game and that you can&amp;#8217;t beat &amp;#8216;em so you&amp;#8217;d better join &amp;#8216;em and invest in the whole market, or&amp;nbsp;index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utility is such a central concept in economics, but one that is not directly measured. 
It explains so much, but remains, like the luminiferous ether, unobservable, its existence inferred from observable&amp;nbsp;phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Kelly Criterion does not directly inform my investment decisions, it does shape my attitude to risk.
I don&amp;#8217;t side with Harry Markowitz, who argued that risk is simply a matter of a variance of a future distribution of returns.
For me, risk is about losing capital, being unable to invest tomorrow.
This, not some sigma value of VaR measure seems to be what should be minimized; this is often done by buying some insurance &amp;#8212; maybe a put or two. This doesn&amp;#8217;t eliminate risk, but reduces it to an uninsurable element,
which Frank Knight argued was the the sort of risk that will be rewarded with profit.
Let&amp;#8217;s hope he was&amp;nbsp;right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lies, damn lies, statistics and unemployment&amp;nbsp;statistics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/23/media-continues-to-misreport-unemployment-claims-31-8-million-people-on-state-federal-unemployment-insurance-week-18-of-u-s-labor-market-collapse/"&gt;Wolf again&lt;/a&gt; nails it. 
Unemployment is a terrible metric: it&amp;#8217;s the difference between two large numbers: people working, and people deemed to be looking for work. Even small errors in estimating either of these can make it go haywire.
Now there are all sorts of quasi-employment. 
It&amp;#8217;s a mess, but as you&amp;#8217;d guess, Wolf explains that things are worse than the headlines&amp;nbsp;suggest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Financial Repression&amp;nbsp;Round&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a7663749-179f-4194-ab89-0f8d7f0158ed"&gt;This Markets Insight&lt;/a&gt; article by Russell Napier is his usual stuff.
Inflation is coming, equities are going down.
It&amp;#8217;ll be like 1945-79 all over again,
except equities won&amp;#8217;t bounce, because their are already in the stratosphere.
This is a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; perspective.
I&amp;#8217;m not sure that here is so bad for equities, but I don&amp;#8217;t think that inflation will be great for equities anywhere for roughly the same reason.
Interesting points are that he thinks that the BoE will not be the principal agent of the govt.
The Treasury will force bad assets (gilts) onto unwilling savers to effect the transfer of wealth from creditors to debtors.
He&amp;#8217;s positive about gold.
The only problem is that everyone is, which is surely a sell signal.
Project Zimbabwe continues&amp;nbsp;apace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Today Wrap&amp;nbsp;(6:30pm)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPY&lt;/span&gt; down against almost everything. Not sure why.
The main equity market down a bit. Precious metals up a bit. 
The dollar down quite a bit. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; getting hit quite a bit, but $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IWM&lt;/span&gt; hit too, so there was no place to hide.
The 10 year note continued to grind higher.
Maybe this is the beginning of the end.
Bizarrely, Donald Trump met with Dave Portnoy: one reality &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; star meets another. Who knows, within the decade we might see Dave getting the Democratic (or Republican) nomination. An equally strange thing happened in&amp;nbsp;2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;House prices never go down, especially in a country with a sovereign currency which the Central Banks is endlessly creating more&amp;nbsp;of&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that&amp;#8217;s a popular view, but the BoJ has demonstrated that this aint necessarily so. Twenty years of falling prices, down more than 40% from ~1992 to 2010 demonstrates as&amp;nbsp;much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Not&amp;nbsp;Trading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/russia-report-golden-visas"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; from Wired sheds some light on how dependent London is on oligarchs and kleptocrats bringing in money for laundering.
This is not exactly news, but it&amp;#8217;s interesting that a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; tech magazine is covering&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had never heard of Glenn Loury before this evening, but &lt;a href="https://www.econtalk.org/glenn-loury-on-race-inequality-and-america/"&gt;this conversation&lt;/a&gt; with Russ Roberts made me hugely respect the guy. 
Clearly, race is a problem in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;, but the solution proposed by the Black Lives Matter movement are surely too simplistic to work. 
It would take me too long to summarize the chat, which was wide ranging, and I would not be able to do justice to Loury&amp;#8217;s wonderful eloquence. Just listen to it: it&amp;#8217;s well worth your time whatever colour your skin happens to&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mildly risk-on.

precious metals breaking higher (especially silver).
Global equities generally higher, but Far East looks precarious.
I understand the arguments that the Fed cannot let the long end of the curve get out of control,
but I can&amp;#8217;t help thinking that with all the funding needed by the Treasury that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; curve will steepen.
I think the same goes for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; curve, but it&amp;#8217;s harder to trade this: the short sterling contract seems moribund, 
and my rule of thumb estimate of the duration of 3-month sterling futures suggests that you need an awful lot of them to hedge out the base level interest rate risk.
Gold grinds higher, although silver is taking a breather after its recent sprint.
I suspect it&amp;#8217;s a good time to buy miners that produce gold, silver and copper, but I don&amp;#8217;t know enough about the individual stocks to risk&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More blah blah about Treasury General&amp;nbsp;Account&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury funds all government spending. It has a bank account, at the Fed, with the money it&amp;#8217;s going to spend. It is issuing (Treasury) securities like a madman, and the balance in the General Account is going through the roof: $1.8 Trn. Currently, this is locked up in the bank, but real soon now it&amp;#8217;ll be in the bank account of a banker near you. Will this light the flame of inflation? Or maybe just another leg up for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt;? Who can&amp;nbsp;tell?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s clear where the money is coming from to invest in stonks. The bit that is unclear is why it ends up inflating the price of a very small number of &amp;#8220;high tech&amp;#8221; stocks, such as the the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt;++ and not other assets, like real estate, wine, oil stocks, transports. Yes, I know that value is not sexy,&amp;nbsp;but  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Whacky&amp;nbsp;Wednesday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wallstreetonparade.com"&gt;Wall Street On Parade&lt;/a&gt; is probably considered a fringe publication.
But it&amp;#8217;s one of the better ones. &lt;a href="https://wallstreetonparade.com/2020/07/warnings-of-fascism-in-america-grow/"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; picks out some whackiness that really couldn&amp;#8217;t be made up.
The Koch network is blamed. 
I tend to blame the alienation of most normal people from the political process, which allows actors like the Koch brothers to have a wildly disportionate influence on&amp;nbsp;events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; equity indexes down today (apart from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IWM&lt;/span&gt; which was flat).
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UST&lt;/span&gt; yields up (inconsistently) but only slightly.
Commodities mixed, though gold still up, silver down. 
Natural gas looks as though it may be headed up (5.7%), but it&amp;#8217;s so volatile (well, it&amp;#8217;s it has a molecular of sixteen, so what do you expect?) it&amp;#8217;s probably better to steer clear of. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTI&lt;/span&gt; is down 1.5%. 
There is a theory that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CL&lt;/span&gt; prices move against one another, but I&amp;#8217;ll leave that for another&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 22nd July 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-22nd-july-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-22T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-07-22:/market-notes-22nd-july-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Opening&amp;nbsp;buzz&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What I read&amp;nbsp;today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://themarket.ch/interview/russell-napier-central-banks-have-become-irrelevant-ld.2323?mc_cid=6c3d214ce8&amp;amp;mc_eid=8d66df2c11"&gt;this interview&lt;/a&gt; Russell Napier, of the &lt;em&gt;Solid Ground Investment Report&lt;/em&gt; states the usual arguments that increased real money supply (created by commercial banks) will result in inflation.
His pick is Swissies (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHF&lt;/span&gt;), on the basis that Switzerland has well-capitalized banks, and not much of a fiscal or current account deficit. 
The problem is with this that it&amp;#8217;s not clear what trade will take advantage of this: if all countries are debasing their currency, what should I buy?
Seems eminently&amp;nbsp;reasonable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s certainly more sensible than shorting equities, &lt;a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2020/07/16/did-the-market-actually-recover-from-covid-19/"&gt;as Kuppy explains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4db326d9-4749-4e13-9ee1-939b0ca7d67d"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; suggests that copper, and copper miners, are under-priced relative to gold miners. Antofagasta is considered a buy. Reasonably interesting thesis, although it does depend on China&amp;#8217;s reopening and reconstruction boom&amp;nbsp;continuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://e-markets.nordea.com/#!/article/58693/fx-weekly-kanye-vs-trump-vs-biden"&gt;This longish piece from Nordea&lt;/a&gt; argues that Biden will be bullish for the dollar, and bearish for risk assets, and this might start soon.
He also points out (as did Druckenmiller a month or so ago) that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury is about to drain a massive amount of liquidity  from banks through &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UST&lt;/span&gt; issuance. The article quantifies this: $1.65 trillion &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UST&lt;/span&gt; issuance, with $0.483 trillion in June alone. A trillion here, a trillion there and pretty soon you&amp;#8217;re talking real money, as Reagan almost said.
Nordea argues that this has to flatten the yield curve. 
I haven&amp;#8217;t had a chance to read the article in detail, but I think that  Andreas Steno Larsen and Joachim Bernhardsen make some well-argued and compelling arguments. 
How risk assets have held up so well is a mystery to me.
The bulls always say, if they are asked how they think that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; can keep going up, they tend to say &amp;#8220;The Fed, Bro.&amp;#8221; But the Treasury is in some ways a bigger beast when it comes to impacting the money supply, and it&amp;#8217;s draining it like Trump promised to drain the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt; swamp. Unlike Trump, it&amp;#8217;s actually happening, and will continue to happen as more of the real economy stalls, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMHO&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 21st July 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-21st-july-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-21T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-07-21:/market-notes-21st-july-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Is the $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; stockprice a&amp;nbsp;bubble?&lt;/h2&gt;

I don&amp;#8217;t really see it myself, but Brooks is a serious&amp;nbsp;commentator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5ee9e268769b5613837afb5c"&gt;My list of miners&lt;/a&gt; includes a mixture of copper, silver &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; gold producers.
I can&amp;#8217;t claim any expertise in this area.
Metals have been on a roll for a while, but lumber has also been on a roll, which is unusual.
In fact, over the last few days, lumber has been trending down, so maybe we are going into a risk-off world.
I am not sure that precious metals necessarily are safe assets,
but T-bonds are sooo expensive now, they are at least worth a look.
There seem to be investors who don&amp;#8217;t trust any form of gold other than those which they can bury in a hole in their garden.
Call me a neophile, but I&amp;#8217;m reasonable confident that Comex will not rip me&amp;nbsp;off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Housing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t bring myself to believe that Covid-19 is bullish for housing. 
&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/17/pent-up-supply-floods-san-francisco-housing-market-most-since-housing-bust/"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; from Wolf Richer suggests that it&amp;#8217;s not going to be in San Francisco. 
&lt;a href="https://www.idiosyncraticwhisk.com/"&gt;Kevin Erdmann&lt;/a&gt; has always said that cities like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SF&lt;/span&gt; drive demand elsewhere, because the supply in them is absolutely constrained, so the demand for close-enough-subsitutes goes up.
The economics of housing are difficult: a house is as unlike an apple or a widget as its possible to be while still being, in some sense, an economic good which can be bought and sold.
I think Erdmann prefers to think in terms of &amp;#8220;housing services&amp;#8221; (with rent as a price, not the capitalized price),
but I haven&amp;#8217;t read his book and I find his explanations on various podcasts I&amp;#8217;ve listened too pretty confusing, 
although he seems to have a clear idea in his own mind of the drivers.
It doesn&amp;#8217;t help that he confines himself to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; market, which I don&amp;#8217;t know or care about.
I&amp;#8217;d like to apply his methods to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, but so far I&amp;#8217;ve&amp;nbsp;failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Airlines&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets seem very &amp;#8220;risk on&amp;#8221; today: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; up 0.2%, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IWM&lt;/span&gt; up 1.4% (although &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; down 1.1%, afer a recent terrific run).
Energy jumped: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XL&lt;/span&gt;$ + 6%, but soft commodities mainly down (wheat up ~10% over a month, so deserves a pause).
Global 10yr yields all up, except Germany: presumably some sort of response to the recent &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; budget and what Germany will contribute to it.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt; largely&amp;nbsp;flat. &lt;/p&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s not tumbling, but it&amp;#8217;s on a trend. 
This implies yield curve steepening. 
One to keep watching, rather than one to act on right away, I&amp;nbsp;think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crazy risk on day today. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; up another 10%. 
Nasdaq up 3.10%. 
Presumably, this is all on vaccine hopes. 
But not many people died: so reducing that number won&amp;#8217;t make much difference, either,
unless of course lockdowns are ended, which will be politically&amp;nbsp;difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spain tries out a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UBI&lt;/span&gt; scheme. It&amp;#8217;s not 100% clear how it will operate,
but it seems to be a genuine large-scale trial. 
I await the result with&amp;nbsp;interest.&lt;/p&gt;

I somehow feel it&amp;#8217;s linked to weaking dollar, but I may be totally&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Market&amp;nbsp;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.verdict.co.uk/retail-banker-international/news/china-to-bar-large-withdrawals-following-surge-in-bank-runs/"&gt;China to bar large withdrawals following surge in bank runs&lt;/a&gt;: this article was followed up &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-14/spate-of-china-bank-runs-force-police-regulators-to-act"&gt;by Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; somewhat later. 
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; does not seem to have picked up on this story, but it surely is important. 
I have been waiting for the cracks to appear the Chinese rally. 
The whole system is rotten: totalitarian regimes rarely have strong stock markets. 
The only thing to worry about is whether the PBoC will allow the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; will slide to save the stockmarket.
I&amp;#8217;m sure that Xi Jinping and his cronies are very busy right now shipping their wealth out of China.
There is the usual Twitter noise about &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; week being the one where the $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; drops 10-12%. It&amp;#8217;s hard to see it happening, but the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANGMAN&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; + $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSFT&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NVDA&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMD&lt;/span&gt;) have got way out of whack with the rest of the index. A reversal trade (long RoI, short &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANGMAN&lt;/span&gt;) might be worth a bob each way, but it&amp;#8217;s hard to&amp;nbsp;structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep thinking that a vertical calendar spread (I think that&amp;#8217;s what it&amp;#8217;s called: diff. strikes &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; expiries, short puts) on some of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; stocks might be worth a punt too. But, please don&amp;#8217;t try this at home (I have to think a lot more about the payoff profile before I try&amp;nbsp;it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Analyst&amp;nbsp;Ratings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sell side analysts are in a difficult position.
Their employers earn income from the buy-side actually, y&amp;#8217;know, buying stuff.
So, they rarely rate a stock a sell. Almost the worst they can do is to make the stock a &amp;#8220;hold.&amp;#8221;
(Well, they wouldn&amp;#8217;t want fund managers who bought on an earlier recommendation to feel cheated!)
I get emails telling me about changes in analyst ratings. The delta probably says more than the level.
The following stocks have at least one &amp;#8220;Sell&amp;#8221; recommendation: $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSX&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HSBA&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RCL&lt;/span&gt;, $W. 
The following have at least one &amp;#8220;Underperform:&amp;#8221; $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HSBA&lt;/span&gt; (actually, 11 of them!), $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RCL&lt;/span&gt;, $W.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MRNA&lt;/span&gt; got a pile of new &amp;#8220;Buys,&amp;#8221; just as the insiders are dumping their stock. 
It&amp;#8217;ll be interesting to see what&amp;nbsp;happens.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 17th July 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-17th-july-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-17T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-07-17:/market-notes-17th-july-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Markets since&amp;nbsp;Wed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFLX&lt;/span&gt; crashed on poor subscription numbers. 
It seems that people are not rushing to fill their enforced idleness with Netflix &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; chill after&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds have stopped moving.
Yield curves are slightly upward sloping, but it seems to me that the Fed is engaged in yield curve control just like the&amp;nbsp;rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commods are stalled. Copper has ended it&amp;#8217;s rally, but is not down much.
Gold was down a bit, but just dragged down with all assets, risk or not, when there was an equity puke on&amp;nbsp;Wed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IWM&lt;/span&gt; has rallied the strongest: it&amp;#8217;s as if $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; has passed the baton to the Russell. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; is plodding along, but it&amp;#8217;s hard to see it winning the&amp;nbsp;race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All markets are down, year to date, with the exception of China, Taiwan, Switzerland and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;.
Emerging markets look sick.
Even Australia is down 11% and Nigeria and Brazil are down a stonking 33%. 
I sort of like Brazil, but I think that equities in general have further to fall and it&amp;#8217;s difficult to hedge this sort of country pairs&amp;nbsp;trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The close seemed surprisingly quiet, given that this is an options expiry day. All the asset classes seem fairly steady.
Credit seems to be experiencing dropping yields, while sovereign yields are increasing. 
The dollar ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt;) reversed yesterday&amp;#8217;s rally.
On many measures (e.g. trade and current balances) the dollar is in a terrible position,
but it&amp;#8217;s hard to quantify the extent to which this offsets the &amp;#8220;exorbitant privilege&amp;#8221; that the currency experiences as the global denominator of all prices. Even though I think that technical analysis is as useful as astrology, the chart does look as though it will continue to go&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEC&lt;/span&gt;, Jay Clayton, Francine&amp;nbsp;McKenna&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TC&lt;/span&gt; podcast, where Francine McKenna was talking about the huge list of conflicts that Jay Clayton had when he was head of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEC&lt;/span&gt; and how unsuitable he&amp;#8217;ll be heading up the investigations at the Southern District of New York. I know nothing about the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; legal system, but this didn&amp;#8217;t sound good to me. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEC&lt;/span&gt; has been supremely supine over market manipulation by Elon Musk, allegedly. I watch from the sidelines with&amp;nbsp;interest.&lt;/p&gt;

Commods are generally down, incl. copper &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; gold.
The 10year note has barely budged. It&amp;#8217;s almost as if the Fed spending $4 trillion bonds has hampered price discovery for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; T-bonds.
&lt;a href="https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/government-economy/china-stock-market-on-a-roll-analysts-warn-of-repeat-of-2015-bubble"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is one of many articles saying that Chinese equities look toppy. 
I couldn&amp;#8217;t agree more, but I&amp;#8217;ve learned the hard way that this is not a buy signal,&amp;nbsp;necessarily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Myth of Central Bank&amp;nbsp;Neutrality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to &lt;a href="https://macromusings.libsyn.com/jens-vant-klooster-on-ecb-bond-purchasing-and-the-myth-of-central-bank-neutrality"&gt;this podcast&lt;/a&gt; in the Macro Musings series. 
It contrasted the styles of the Fed &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNB&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, Eurozone, Swiss central banks).
It sort of pointed out the obvious, that CBs buying different types of assets creates winners and losers, and these are different according to what style is adopted, but that now, with asset purchases being so overwhelming, the CBs are really starting to do fiscal policy: shifting resources around between different groups in society.
This should, for obvious reasons, be the remit of elected governments: nobody elects central bankers.
It is a fairly dry, academic discussion, but it raises an important issue which is only going to get bigger as governments call on central banks to do more of the heavy lifting.
In a number of episodes, David Beckworth has had guests who essentially make the same point: that governments should step up to the plate and do more of this work, and not rely on the Fed (usually) to bail out businesses, especially as a lot of these &amp;#8220;pandemic loans&amp;#8221; will never be repaid and are therefore grants in a thin&amp;nbsp;disguise. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 13th July 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-13th-july-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-13T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-07-13:/market-notes-13th-july-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Morning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chinese authorities seem determined to distract their citizens from the Hong Kong security law clampdown by juicing their stockmarket. 
The Shanghai Composite and the ChiNext indexes both went up over 7% (these are roughly the equivalent of the S&amp;amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; indexes). In an entirely unrelated development, the Chinese authorities loosened monetary conditions at a record pace. For the gory details, check this weekend&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://creditbubblebulletin.blogspot.com/2020/07/weekly-commentary-utmost-crazy.html"&gt;Credit Bubble Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;. 
ChiNext is up 54% this year. Just imagine where it would be if we hadn&amp;#8217;t had a global pandemic that has destroyed 20% of jobs on the&amp;nbsp;planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bulletin has an excellent summary of the week&amp;#8217;s market&amp;#8217;s developments. The general tone was risk-on helped by authorities being quick to apply extra monetary and fiscal stimulus.
The disease is still a serious problem and it&amp;#8217;s politically impossible for authorities to neglect it entirely,
but essentially all measures which slow the disease are damaging for the economy, 
so it&amp;#8217;s hard to see markets continuing to grind higher, at least in real&amp;nbsp;terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The White House seems to be continuing to pump out news about a Phase 2 Trade Deal and an imminent development of a cheap and widely available vaccine. Fewer and fewer people are paying attention.
Certainly, I&amp;#8217;ve stopped some time ago, except in that I&amp;#8217;ll try never to be short of risk assets when 
I see another news conference&amp;nbsp;coming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Styles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reading some post the other day when an investor said, basically, that as an investor one had to decide on one&amp;#8217;s own strategy and follow it, religiously and not be influenced by what other investors say their are buying and&amp;nbsp;selling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most successful investors in interviews seem to emphasize how important it is to stick to a single set of trading rules, or strategies, and not be swept along with the flow of news or other information that constantly is being published. Obviously, most big investors will have an incentive to pretend they are selling when they are in fact buying, or at least wait until they&amp;#8217;ve established their position before they reveal what they&amp;#8217;ve bought, especially when their are a big player relative to the size of the&amp;nbsp;market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand that this is the received wisdom, but if traders had perfect hindsight they&amp;#8217;d all execute &lt;em&gt;the same&lt;/em&gt; strategy and make a lot of profits. If someone could decipher the Rosetta Stone of the tape, and decided to share it with you, you&amp;#8217;d be mad not to follow it. Of course, such a solution doesn&amp;#8217;t exist, because the stock market is a voting machine, which responds to the popular vote.
Trader Vic, interviewed on the Market Huddle podcast, explained how over his long and successful trading career he&amp;#8217;d seen various &amp;#8220;dead cert&amp;#8221; trading strategy collapse as the arbitrage eliminated the&amp;nbsp;inefficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, the style seems to buy momentum and trade like Dave Portnoy.
This too will pass, but it seems it&amp;#8217;s going to run for a while&amp;nbsp;yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trading&amp;nbsp;ideas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t really have anything very convincing.
It seems to me that with the wild ride that copper has been on lately the miners must eventually benefit.
A handy thing about copper miners is that they usually also produce silver and gold, so you get a bit of commodity diversification thrown in for free.
One that might be worth a second look is $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TECK&lt;/span&gt;.
I&amp;#8217;ve created a &lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5f098e96aeead4b613d02120"&gt;watchlist of copper miners on Koyfin&lt;/a&gt;. 
This might be worth looking at alongside &lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5ee9e268769b5613837afb5c"&gt;some precious metal miners that have been mentioned by Fleck himself&lt;/a&gt;. Note that I might have got the tickers messed up for this list, so please tell me if you spot any non-miners&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;

(Image shamelessly hotlinked from &lt;a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/"&gt;Kuppy&amp;#8217;s Blog&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After weeks of drifting perilously close to the rocks, the &lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5ee9e268769b5613837afb5c"&gt;&amp;#8220;Incredible Hulks&amp;#8221; stocks&lt;/a&gt; seem to be staging a minor rally.
Stock prices seem very sensitive to the price of oil. In a theoretical world, it might be worth trying to hedge this risk of holding these stocks. Investing in these stocks is pretty risky. For more info, read Kuppy&amp;#8217;s blog, of which &lt;a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2019/01/13/scorpio-tankers/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is one of many entries on tankers&amp;nbsp;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Intel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s funny how some stocks just sink gently without anyone noticing them go.
In the 90&amp;#8217;s everyone was moaning about the &amp;#8220;Win-Tel&amp;#8221; monopoly that $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSFT&lt;/span&gt; and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;INTC&lt;/span&gt; had over personal computers.
Wind forward a decade or two, and now other players are much more important than half of this duo.
I wonder when $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSFT&lt;/span&gt; will follow its&amp;nbsp;partner.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 10th July 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-10th-july-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-10T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-07-10:/market-notes-10th-july-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;All&amp;nbsp;Day&lt;/h2&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s now about the close for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; markets, and clearly it&amp;#8217;s been a risk-on day.
Copper is up quite strongly, gold flat, yields all up, all equity markets up (to a good first approximation).
All the Robin Hood favourites seem to be up, especially $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; but also Carnival ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CCL&lt;/span&gt;), up about 11%!
One day the wheels will come off, but obviously today was not the day.
Seemingly, the driver is vaccine hopes.
Cases seem to keep going up in some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; states.
Mask wearing is now becoming mandatory in more places.
Some more criticism of the help targetted by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; chancellor at hospitality,
but mainly from sectors (like manufacturing) which didn&amp;#8217;t get so much help.

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s hard to get a feel for the overall tone of the markets, but the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; was pretty downbeat today.
Sunak&amp;#8217;s giveaways will push the deficit to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBP&lt;/span&gt; 350bln, which maybe a price worth paying, but can only spread the pain, not take it away.
A lot of industries will clearly never be the same&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Fleckenstein tipped &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WDOFF&lt;/span&gt;: he rarely sees a stock he likes. It&amp;#8217;s a small cap and has no derivs, so I just mention&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; July future now below 30. Hurrah, the pandemic is&amp;nbsp;over!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong looks increasingly grisly, but Chinese and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HK&lt;/span&gt; stocks continue to go up.
Stock price manipulation is against the rules of the Shanghai and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HK&lt;/span&gt; exchanges, so we can&amp;#8217;t be 100% confident that this is not the&amp;nbsp;explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Things that are impossible to&amp;nbsp;believe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie Bilello nails &lt;a href="https://compoundadvisors.com/2020/put-these-charts-on-your-wall-2020-edition?ck_subscriber_id=694496162"&gt;a few mind boggling things about this market&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stocks can&amp;#8217;t go up, and up, and up in the teeth of a&amp;nbsp;recession,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the popularity of technical analysis is matched only by its failure to explain simple charts ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTZ&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZM&lt;/span&gt; given as&amp;nbsp;examples),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even when a stock is just a way of holding another, easy to value, asset, the stock price can still zoom far above &amp;#8220;fundamentals.&amp;#8221; ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETH&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commodity prices cannot below zero (we all know what this refers&amp;nbsp;to),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stein&amp;#8217;s Law holds for interest rates (still going down after nearly 40&amp;nbsp;years!),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s impossible for a company with no sales or earnings to be worth $26bln ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NKLA&lt;/span&gt;),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;#8230; and so on for another half dozen&amp;nbsp;examples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie points out that it&amp;#8217;s too easy to think &amp;#8220;that can&amp;#8217;t happen&amp;#8221; and invest accordingly.
Maynard Keynes said the same thing when he talked about markets remaining irrational for longer than he could remain solvent.
Jesse Livermore talked about the importance of getting in at the beginning of rallies, because without the initial profits the reversals would be enough to make people get out before the end: the early profits (irrationally, because they are sunk) are enough to make the speculator hold his&amp;nbsp;position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the most irrational trend of all is interest rates: going down for all of forty years. 
I frequently blog about the possibility of seeing inflation, which would finally end the trend, 
but it&amp;#8217;s still not here. Here is the&amp;nbsp;chart:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="37 years of declining US interest rates" src="https://compoundadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/10-yr-yield-low-7-6.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seems like the market has decide it&amp;#8217;s risk-off time.
Dollar up, everything but soft commodities down (lean hogs roaring!). 
Equities down &lt;strong&gt;even Nasdaq&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; up. 
We&amp;#8217;ve had so many false dawns, but maybe this is&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Added at 21:35) Nasdaq back up (0.73%) but &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; down (0.6%). Very wide divergence. 
Global equities all down. Copper still up.
10-year treasuries up 0.17% (yield dropped&amp;nbsp;3bp).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Where is the dollar&amp;nbsp;going?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Howell &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8e7379c5-9324-4d31-9fcb-fd1e7bc621b0"&gt;sees&lt;/a&gt; China pivoting to holding European bonds in place of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury bonds. He concludes that the dollar must go down, and the Euro up. 
Certainly, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt; is issuing a lot of debt, and I guess &amp;#8220;Eurobonds&amp;#8221; (jointly issued bonds for all Eurozone treasuries) will eventually arrive but I think that the Eurozone needs to sort out some deep seated problems before China takes the plunge.
I sort of feel bearish on the dollar, but it still has a lot going for it.
But it&amp;#8217;s certainly right that Chinese purchases of dollar assets are dropping and will continue to drop: China is simply not exporting so much stuff (net) to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; denominated economies any longer.
I&amp;#8217;m not sure where Russia fits into all this (although I&amp;#8217;m sure that the Ruble is not about to turn into the Swiss&amp;nbsp;Franc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I think that the dollar will remain strong until inflation gets so strong that all the eighteen (?) indexes of it that the Fed looks at are clearly shouting that it&amp;#8217;s out of control.
But by then, we will truly be in a different world. The problem is that, &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4357129-real-unemployment-situation"&gt;as this post points out&lt;/a&gt;, unemployment is probably going to go through the roof. 
Either Bill Phillips was totally deluded, or we&amp;#8217;re going to see subdued inflation for a long time. 
Or maybe we&amp;#8217;re going to win 10 bonus points for spotting a rare economic phenomenon:&amp;nbsp;stagflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trading&amp;nbsp;Strategies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing calls and puts can be a cheap way of getting into a position. 
Say you are bullish about a stock, but you think it&amp;#8217;s trading about 10% above where you&amp;#8217;d prefer to buy it.
If you write puts at a strike 10% out of the money, then either the stock price goes up (in which case it&amp;#8217;s even more above the price you would be comfortable opening the position) or it goes down and the option is exercised &amp;#8220;against you.&amp;#8221; In fact, all that has happened is that you got the stock for 10% less than when you first thought about buying it and you&amp;#8217;ve received the premium for giving someone the option of selling to you at a discount. Win-win! Of course, you need to evaluation what the stock is &amp;#8220;really&amp;#8221; worth to you. If it pays a heavy yield, then maybe it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter if the price continues to sink. This is not an original thought, but it&amp;#8217;s another way of looking at writing options.
&lt;em&gt;Obviously&lt;/em&gt;, never do this if you don&amp;#8217;t have the liquidity to take assignment: i.e. pay for the stock. 
Of course, it doesn&amp;#8217;t need to be a stock. It works just as well with bond (futures), currencies, commodities etc. But it does depend on you having a clear understanding of why you want to hold the&amp;nbsp;underlying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all works in reverse if you want to short a stock, but you&amp;#8217;d prefer to open your position at a price above where it&amp;#8217;s trading right now, so you get more &amp;#8220;bang for your buck&amp;#8221; when your plan pans out and you see the issuer go bankrupt as soon as you&amp;#8217;ve established your position(!)
In this case, you just write the&amp;nbsp;call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here endeth today&amp;#8217;s lesson in option trading. Please remember that this isn&amp;#8217;t investment advice and you simply should not do this with funds you can&amp;#8217;t afford to&amp;nbsp;lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;House&amp;nbsp;Prices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owners of the Case-Shiller house price index &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/07/us-house-prices-to-drop-6-6-by-may-2021-first-annual-decline-since-jan-2012-corelogic-owner-of-the-case-shiller-index/"&gt;point out&lt;/a&gt; that the event of a lot of people becoming unemployed is going to be negative for house prices.
Clearly, unemployment will shift the demand schedule for housing.
Not rocket science, but a major player is saying&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The politics&amp;nbsp;bit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a chat with some guys about trade, agriculture and the environment.
I am constantly surprised at how the ecowarriors have got control of the trade agenda.
For what it&amp;#8217;s worth, I think we should leave animal welfare and the climate to be sorted by direct action (such as a carbon tax or geoengineering) rather than creating complicated tariff regimes that impoverish consumers that spend a large part of their income on food and enrich agribusinesses, especially those can pay lobbyists to craft the regulations to block international competition which would threaten their clients. 
Anyway, voters love the idea of food independence and autarky in general, so there is no point in being an economics nerd and arguing against them just because they make voters worse off.
Voters vote with their emotions, not with their wallets, it&amp;nbsp;seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Russell&amp;nbsp;2000&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vincent Deluard points out that the quoted P/E ratio on the Russell 2000 is essentially meaningless,

It may even be negative, because losses incurred by constituents are simply ignored.
It&amp;#8217;s like me being allowed to ignore all my losing trades in working out my performance to date.
I have known this for a long time, but the index keeps marching up.
I know, I know, nobody wants to invest in firms that make profits in today&amp;#8217;s market, 
so this should have been expected.
Well, if something cannot go on forever it will stop.
But maybe not for a really, really long&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mad&amp;nbsp;Markets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; went up 15% today. It&amp;#8217;s a blatant fraud. The market is truly mad.
However, it&amp;#8217;s not for us to question why, it&amp;#8217;s just for us to buy and buy (puts, if need be).
I have no idea why a company that which will never make a profit or pay a dividend can be worth anything,
but that&amp;#8217;s why Dave Portnoy is rich and I am poor.
Anyway, Fed go Brrrr is making everything go up,
and also vols go up.
Kuppy &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Patrick Cerezna have an interesting discussion on why vols are going up,
but the conclusion they come to is that it&amp;#8217;s the right time to sell vol and go long,
by writing puts on small cap stocks you don&amp;#8217;t mind being exercised into.
Kuppy talked about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PG&lt;/span&gt;&amp;amp;E ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PGEUU&lt;/span&gt;), but there are more.
I favour the &amp;#8220;Incredible Hulks&amp;#8221; set, that I originally learned about from Kuppy.
You can have a look at it &lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5e830370d9be6037d4ad6746"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
What is worth noting is that some of these are trading at a P/E (for the next twelve months, projected) of 2.0. 
Going short in this market is going to lose you money, so buying a stock which is so cheap might be the way to go (&lt;em&gt;this is not trading advice&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are really feeling like taking some risk, why not buy some other fraud stocks.
For example, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIO&lt;/span&gt; went up 23% today. No, it doesn&amp;#8217;t have any P so I can&amp;#8217;t give you a P/E&amp;nbsp;ratio.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category><category term="politics"></category><category term="grumpiness"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 4-5th July 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-4-5th-july-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-05T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-07-05:/market-notes-4-5th-july-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Worth&amp;nbsp;Reading&lt;/h2&gt;

It&amp;#8217;s as if the planes that will have to be sold, and the pilots who know how to fly them would be deployed productively by other companies if the existing, badly run companies, were allowed to go bust. Of course &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/06/21/alitalia-lufthansa-condor-norwegian-other-european-airlines-try-to-survive/"&gt;as we know&lt;/a&gt; the financing of airlines is a mess, with governments ever-ready to step in to bail out their national champions because it would be embarrassing for politicians not to have airlines flying the flag.

But of course there is massive lobbying to make sure that when the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; leaves the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; we won&amp;#8217;t comply with this policy or, in other words, future governments will shovel more of our money in the direction of the companies that pay the lobbyists. So, governments justify bailing out national champions because, well, other governments will bail out national champions. It&amp;#8217;s almost as if the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; had devised a mechanism to stop this prisoner&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/04/as-the-biggest-restaurant-chains-in-the-uk-fall-into-bankruptcy-attention-turns-to-kkr-other-private-equity-firms-that-own-them/"&gt;As the Biggest Restaurant Chains in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; Fall into Bankruptcy, Attention Turns to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KKR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Other &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PE&lt;/span&gt; Firms that Own Them&lt;/a&gt;. 
It seems that financing pubs and restaurants with near 100% debt was not a great idea after&amp;nbsp;all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can J. Powell&amp;#8217;s printer &amp;#8220;go &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BRRRRR&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; fast enough to finance Trump&amp;#8217;s re-election&amp;nbsp;strategy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/jpmorgan-concludes-world-drowning-too-much-debt-stocks-go-down-again"&gt;JPMorgan Concludes The World Is Drowning In Too Much Debt For Stocks To Go Down Again&lt;/a&gt;.
I try to avoid reposting too much stuff from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZH&lt;/span&gt;. It makes me look like a conspiracy theorist.
It seems that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPM&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s analyst Nicholas Panigirtzoglou put out a note saying that the yield curve inversion we&amp;#8217;ve recently seen was spookily like that which preceeded the Q4 2018 mini-crash. 
24 hours later he had put out a contradictory note saying that with the Fed doing so much money printing it was impossible that stocks would ever go down again. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZH&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s conspiracy theory was that he was leaned&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, Druckenmiller in his June 2020 interview mentioned that in Q3 the financing required by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury would start to exceed the quantity of easing being conducted by the Fed.
Central Bankers are constantly pleading with Treasuries around the world to &amp;#8220;do their bit&amp;#8221; for stimulus by running deficits. I have always thought this was just a front, and an admission that the CBs were running out of treasurys [sic] to buy. Maybe this time Powell will get his wish. 
&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/03/qe-unwinds-feds-assets-drop-for-3rd-week-another-76-billion-3-week-total-163-billion/"&gt;Wolf Richer has noticed this too&lt;/a&gt;. They said they&amp;#8217;d act quickly and avoid the extended unwind that characterized &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE1&lt;/span&gt;-4. I&amp;#8217;ll believe it when I see it, but they&amp;#8217;ve made a good start.
&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/06/19/i-who-hates-shorting-just-shorted-the-entire-stock-market-heres-why/"&gt;Wolf commented about this on 19th June too&lt;/a&gt;,
and &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/06/18/fed-ends-qe-total-assets-drop-liquidity-injection-ends/"&gt;on the 18th&lt;/a&gt;.
He&amp;#8217;s nothing if not&amp;nbsp;consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s all very confusing, because actually the Fed &lt;a href="https://koyfin.com/s/mZPVybEfsa"&gt;has been shrinking its total lending since 7th June&lt;/a&gt;. 
Yes, Koyfin is a pretty wonderful system, for the price. The neat thing is that if you find the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; for a data series in the St Louis &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FRED&lt;/span&gt; system, you can just type it into&amp;nbsp;Koyfin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is&amp;nbsp;money?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://macromusings.libsyn.com/daniela-gabor-on-financial-globalization-capital-controls-and-the-critical-macrofinance-framework"&gt;Daniela Gabor on Financial Globalization, Capital Controls, and the Critical Macrofinance Framework&lt;/a&gt; is a great podcast, but one which requires a bit more concentration than some.
Daniela refers to work by Herman Minsky, but at no point mentions his &amp;#8220;Minsky Moment&amp;#8221; work. 
It&amp;#8217;s a dense podcast, which looks at the details of the monetary financing regimes on both sides of the Atlantic. 
Divisia M4 gets a mention too: something I still find very récherché. 
I recommend it, if only as an example of what high quality podcasts are available now on more esoteric subjects.
A few takeaways: shadow banking is important. ETFs are very important. What constitutes money is changing. It&amp;#8217;s not enough for the Central Banks now just to stand behind &amp;#8220;traditional&amp;#8221; banks. 
People seem to have stopped worrying about ETFs. 
Like banks, they seem to achieve a miraculous maturity and liquidity transformation on underlying assets which are neither.
Possibly, like banks, when the going gets tough, the curtain will be pulled back to reveal an old man performing a parlour trick.
(On that note, did you know that the Wizard of Oz was meant to represent the Chairman of the Fed in Frank Baum&amp;#8217;s book, although he always denied&amp;nbsp;it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M2 is taking&amp;nbsp;off:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Insider&amp;nbsp;Sales&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a negative view on a number of stocks.
Reported in $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EHTH&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MRNA&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MU&lt;/span&gt;, $W, which are amongst those stocks.
Probably&amp;nbsp;nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

The message seems to be that in the complex dance with the Fed and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury (Powell &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Mnuchin) there will be a tightening which will cause the steepener trade to falter, by which Larsen seems to mean the 10year - 2 year yield on USTs. 
To execute the trade you need to know the duration ratio, which is handily available in English and Chines &lt;a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/tools-information/quikstrike/treasury-analytics.html?redirect=/trading/interest-rates/invoice-spread-calculator.html"&gt;via the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CME&lt;/span&gt; Group website&lt;/a&gt;.
As this helpful page points out, the multiplier for the 2-year is twice the 10 year (2000 vs 1000), so the notional ratio is approx 1:1, but don&amp;#8217;t do this at home, folks!
To profit from the flattener, you don&amp;#8217;t sell the long end and buy the short end, because the shape of the curve refers to yields, not prices. Confused? You bet I&amp;nbsp;was!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drivers yield curves are complex. If you don&amp;#8217;t believe me, read &lt;a href="https://themacrotourist.substack.com/p/the-worlds-biggest-steepener"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; from the wonderful Kevin Muir.
Taking a view on the steepness of the curve sounds a safer bet than going long or short rates, 
but it&amp;#8217;s not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;safe! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More about&amp;nbsp;unemployment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unemployment (next to inflation) is almost impossible to measure accurately in normal times.
In the current pandemic, it&amp;#8217;s a hopeless task.
Nevertheless, the market rallied on one measure, which was &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/02/never-before-have-i-seen-so-much-fake-unemployment-jobs-data-by-the-bureau-of-labor-statistics-while-labor-department-nails-it/"&gt;miles away from the other measure&lt;/a&gt;.
I don&amp;#8217;t pretend to know what the real figure is, but I&amp;#8217;d be gobsmacked if we ended this calendar year with anything like full employment, either here or in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Biden&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try not to spend too much time looking at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; politics. It&amp;#8217;s far too depressing. &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/505562-biden-must-release-results-of-his-cognitive-decline-tests-voters-need-to"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; though was interesting. It&amp;#8217;s from a reporter who appears vaguely sympathetic to Biden, 
but who reports that around 40% of voters think is suffering from dementia.
How on earth can the Democrats choose a candidate with such a crippling disqualification from being president? 
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; Labour Party seems to have a death wish, but at least they chose a leader who is under sixty.
The Dems chose a candidate who is &lt;em&gt;four years older than Bill Clinton&lt;/em&gt; (and five years older than Hillary). 
This just shows how dysfunctional the leadership of political parties has become. 
Presumably, Biden ended up as the candidate because he was biddable. 
It&amp;#8217;s a crap deal for the voters, though, and will probably gift Trump another term.
You&amp;#8217;d almost think that the Wall Street donors who pay Hillary $250K for a twenty minute speech and pay so much into the Dems would prefer a business-friendly, anti-redistribution kinda guy after&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; markets (equities, anyhow) are closed today, so there is not much to&amp;nbsp;report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pubs open tomorrow in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. A symbolic moment, I suppose, 
but I don&amp;#8217;t think it will in any sense represent a cliff edge in terms of our return to normality,
as there will be new outbreaks of the disease, 
and this will cause more ordinary citizens to be fearful.
Maybe I&amp;#8217;m being too pessimistic. 
The last couple of books I&amp;#8217;ve read have been about the Great Depression,
and my mind is constantly brought back to that time, especially in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;,
where all the state&amp;#8217;s resources were not enough to put the economy back together again.
I hope I&amp;#8217;m&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 2nd July 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-2nd-july-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-02T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-07-02:/market-notes-2nd-july-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Morning&lt;/h2&gt;

The short sellers have made a packet on Wirecard, but are probably not rushing back to short anything else.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; makes headlines by overtaking Toyota in terms of market cap, if not enterprise value (Toyota has more debt financing). 
Nobody can explain why $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; can be worth so much, but nobody is going to risk their capital by shorting it.
I guess that&amp;#8217;s all the explanation you need.

Its hard to believe there are any bears left to squeeze.
My understanding is that at this point the stock will start trading at some kind of rational valuation.
It&amp;#8217;d be exceedingly dangerous to put money on&amp;nbsp;that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created a Google alert to look out for news items mentioning shorts by well known asset managers.
Unfortunately, by the time you read that (e.g.) Crispin Odey is shorting Stock $X, you sort of know he&amp;#8217;s just written the press release to make it cheaper for him to cover. 
Not that I&amp;#8217;m cynical like that, or&amp;nbsp;anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is definitely the time to be delta (equity) neutral, and probably pretty much theta neutral too. 
So you might as well go to the&amp;nbsp;beach!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jobs number and Presidential press conference gave an adrenaline shot to the stockmarket (although it left bonds unimpressed).

What a wonderful piece of software!
I&amp;#8217;ve been selling a bit of vol for a while,
but this is such a neat way of crafting a &amp;#8216;combination&amp;#8217;.
I&amp;#8217;ll probably write some more when I&amp;#8217;ve had more chance to do experiments in the&amp;nbsp;lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The markets are stubbornly up on employment being down only 26% since the start of the year.
I can&amp;#8217;t imagine the highs we&amp;#8217;d get if it were down only&amp;nbsp;20%.&lt;/p&gt;

Dollar is flat, (nearly) all commodities up (including gold).

Andrew Bailey, BoE Governor, says that inflation may be coming.
John Plender says &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2c4655ac-e740-495b-a3cf-6df278f129b9"&gt;the same thing, but more elegantly&lt;/a&gt;.
One third of advertisers say they won&amp;#8217;t advertise on social media.

He kind of points out the obvious: that nobody has a clue what will happen to them.
He couches this specifically in respect of reporting of the latest Case-Shiller figures, 
but all news everywhere will suffer from the same problem.
My guess is that house prices are going to take quite a dive.
Interest rates for high-grade borrowers are probably as low as they can go,
without the banks losing money on every mortgage,
so finance is going to dry up,
even though the banks have been pumped full of stimulus.
You can force banks to build up their reserves but nothing in the world can make them lend them,
no matter how much money creation the BoE does.
Wolf has &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/01/waiting-for-pent-up-demand-uk-house-prices-in-june-fall-for-first-time-since-2012-mortgage-approvals-slump-to-record-low-despite-partial-reopening/"&gt;written a parallel piece on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; housing market&lt;/a&gt;.
Mortgage approvals have fallen by a factor of seven. If that doesn&amp;#8217;t flush out some desperate sellers, I don&amp;#8217;t know what will. I would not like to be an estate agent in this climate, but &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s have a remarkable ability to survive a fee drought. Sadly, no options traded on Foxtons, (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AFAIK&lt;/span&gt;) the only listed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading&amp;nbsp;ideas: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;short bonds (pity there are no gilt futures&amp;nbsp;options),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;short $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FB&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;short $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HSI&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, this is not investment advice, and now is almost certainly not the right time.
As Trader Vic says, execute only when the technicals agree with the fundamentals.
Don&amp;#8217;t ask me about&amp;nbsp;technicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities were all over the place, bonds weaker, stocks generally stronger on a reaction (supposedly) to Trump caving in on banning Huawei, and generally signalling that he&amp;#8217;s not going to do anything to damage trade with China (any more than it&amp;#8217;s already been&amp;nbsp;damaged).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stats are all over the place with massive percentage gains in things like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ADP&lt;/span&gt; payroll numbers, because of artifically depressed levels last&amp;nbsp;month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, my feeling is that things are going to slump again, but I have no real evidence for&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tanker trade is coming back to life. The short calls on Robin Hood faves is doing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, but uses a lot of&amp;nbsp;capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A bit of politics and&amp;nbsp;economics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that a big sticking point in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s negotiation with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; is the fact that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; wants to stop being bound by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; rules on state aid.
I just can&amp;#8217;t imagine why we&amp;#8217;d want to die in a ditch for the right to load deadweight costs on ourselves by subsidizing producers.
It&amp;#8217;s as if nobody in government has come across the fact that unsubsidized competitive markets maximize the sum of consumer and producer surplus.
Or, maybe they have, but they want to make sure their party gets enough donations to win the next&amp;nbsp;election.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes and a bit of science, 30th June 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-and-a-bit-of-science-30th-june-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-06-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-06-30:/market-notes-and-a-bit-of-science-30th-june-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Trader&amp;nbsp;Vic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally listened to the rest of the Trader Vic interview (see 
&lt;a href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-27-28th-june-2020.html"&gt;my weekend post&lt;/a&gt;). He is really very interesting.

&lt;p&gt;I finally listened to the rest of the Trader Vic interview (see 
&lt;a href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-27-28th-june-2020.html"&gt;my weekend post&lt;/a&gt;). He is really very interesting.
He talked about how interest on excess reserves suppresses inflation.
(Actually, Warren Mosler sort of reveals this when he talks about his chat with the official from the Bank of Italy.) He really blames Obama for this, which is interesting. 
It certainly benefitted the big &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; banks&amp;nbsp;hugely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, he is not only predicting inflation, but actual  hyperinflation at some point as something the Fed deliberately lets rip to bail out the Treasury. As he points out, four months of 50% a month will bring the &lt;a href="https://www.transparency.treasury.gov/dataset/debt-to-the-penny/table-view"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; total debt&lt;/a&gt; down to next to&amp;nbsp;nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, when Vic was asked what he&amp;#8217;d advise his younger self, he said that he&amp;#8217;d tell the Young Vic to learn more about politics, because now the markets were driven much by politics than by company or macro economic fundamentals.&amp;nbsp;Respect!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altogether a great listen. Congrats to Kevin &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Patrick (but especially&amp;nbsp;Kevin).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;China publishes fake stats? Surely&amp;nbsp;not!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been a few days since I posted a link to &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/06/27/world-trade-plunges-heres-why-its-even-worse-chinas-deep-fake-data-comes-to-light/"&gt;a page from WolfStreet&lt;/a&gt;. This one points out how devastating the panic has been in terms of world trade, but it extends to analysis to make a (to me) unrefutable case that the export numbers coming out of China are fake.
We all know that reporting of global trade has always been flakey. The planet seems to have a huge deficit with itself, if you add up all the exports and compare the total with all the imports, as declared. But China is world class when it comes to the scale of its fakery, and this is yet another&amp;nbsp;example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How one can make a profit from this knowledge is, however, somewhat beyond me. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FXI&lt;/span&gt; has hardly budged,&amp;nbsp;relatively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;random&amp;nbsp;tickers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quiz: what links the&amp;nbsp;following?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSX&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GNUS&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DUO&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IQ&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;QTT&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LK&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WINS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to profit from today&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;market&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no real idea. A few ideas which the brave might&amp;nbsp;try:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write calls on index&amp;nbsp;options,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy long-dated puts on the&amp;nbsp;Nasdaq,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy&amp;nbsp;copper,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sell Brazilian&amp;nbsp;Reals,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buy the Brazilian bovespa, but only denominated in reals (or hedge, I&amp;nbsp;guess),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sell $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MU&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/goodalexander/status/1277968930871492610"&gt;buy Brent crude, sell &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; frackers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TBH&lt;/span&gt;, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t really execute any of these, but they are food for thought. 
Remember wise old George Soros&amp;#8217;s advice: don&amp;#8217;t trade until you see the whites of their&amp;nbsp;eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Equities up, everything else down.
Bonds down, commodities (especially $GC_F) up.
$&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; flat. Individual currencies all over the place. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RUR&lt;/span&gt; down&amp;nbsp;1.45%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best strategy probably to sell equity vol.
For the&amp;nbsp;moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hostility to Fed on Twitter at all times high (Powell giving a speech?). 
Generally high anger over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BLM&lt;/span&gt;, Covid, lockdown, statues, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; leaving the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Science&amp;nbsp;Bit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.academia.edu/5276259/Hygiene_Hypothesis_and_Autoimmune_Diseases"&gt;Great chapter summarizing an important theory about the rise of autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and T2 diabetes, by Graham Rook&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, it&amp;#8217;s because our immune systems go mad without a wide range of pathogens to develop themselves&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from the&amp;nbsp;conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8230; this chapter is not intending to suggest that the Old Friends hypothesis is the whole explanation for the rise in autoimmune diseases.But the genetic,molecular mimicry and viral hypotheses are incoherent without a major simultaneous environmental change to weaken background immunoregulation, so that certain genotypes, in the presence of certain triggers, can develop these&amp;nbsp;diseases.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

but somehow can&amp;#8217;t come up with an obvious&amp;nbsp;candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Danielle&amp;nbsp;Martino-Booth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Irons &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/qtrresearch/status/1274090504439894017"&gt;has interviewed&lt;/a&gt; Danielle di-Martino Booth.
She is not some kind of fringe conspiracist of the sort (arguably) that Chris often invites onto his podcast. 
She spent nine years as an advisor to Richard Fisher at the Fed Reserve Bank of Dallas. 
She is not J Powell, but she is not Peter Schiff.
The interview is wide-ranging, but she says&amp;nbsp;that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Fed has massively exacerbated inequality (even though Powell denies&amp;nbsp;it),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the dollar will probably lose its status as a reserve currency, and this will provoke a &amp;#8220;hot war&amp;#8221; with&amp;nbsp;China,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;even the Fed admits, in private, that it rigs the inflation measure in order to justify its primary mandate of inflating asset&amp;nbsp;markets, &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UBI&lt;/span&gt; in America is coming, and the unlimited funds that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CARES&lt;/span&gt; Act gives to an incoming president will lead to some extraordinary inflationary actions once Biden is&amp;nbsp;elected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

everyone I follow seems to have the same view about the&amp;nbsp;Fed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trader Vic (Up Close &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Personal with Trader Vic (guest: Victor Sperandeo) - Market Huddle&amp;nbsp;Ep.86)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUm5xcIISac"&gt;Up Close &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Personal with Trader Vic (guest: Victor Sperandeo) - Market Huddle Ep.86&lt;/a&gt;. The interviewee is full of interesting anecdotes.
He was very good about the importance of the Fed paying interest on reserves (which killed the inflation which &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE2&lt;/span&gt; would have otherwise generated) and the reason that gold has done so much better than silver recently. The reason is that gold bullion is treated as a Tier 1 asset by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIS&lt;/span&gt;, so banks can hold it without requiring any capital. (Explained in more detail &lt;a href="https://www.pinnacledigest.com/mining-stocks/central-bank-purchases-gold/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) What was quite interesting was that he explained this in terms of the interest on excess reserves crushing the velocity of money, by which he essentially meant the willingness of banks to convert reserves (risk-free assets) to actual loans to finance real consumption and capital formation (risky assets). As he said, why use up precious capital to make loans at very low rates when you get free money from the Fed in &lt;em&gt;essentially unlimited quantities&lt;/em&gt; (because you can increase deposits, or at least borrow, at a cheaper rate, probably, I guess). He was very good about some earlier crises, including the role that James Baker played in the 1987 crash, which he lived through. He attributed this to politicians saying things the market implications of which they did not understand. In this case Baker was trying to make Germany reduce its interest rate, which it would not, so Baker said that he would bring down the dollar unilaterally, which Vic claims caused lots of foreign holders &lt;em&gt;of all &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; assets including stocks&lt;/em&gt; to liquidate them, precipitating the&amp;nbsp;crash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d never heard of the guy before, but he&amp;#8217;s obviously a very successful trader, and has written a number of interesting-looking &lt;a href="https://www.victorsperandeo.com/"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was doing other things as this interview took place, so I should probably listen to it again.
One thing Vic said, which sounded so wise, was that he never took a position unless &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; the technical signals &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the fundamentals were with him.
There are traders who claim that fundamentals don&amp;#8217;t matter.
There are traders who think that technical analysis is about as useful as astrology.
The fact that both seem to co-exist and make enough profits to stop themselves going extinct suggests that there is something in both&amp;nbsp;approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vic has has known some giants of finance, including George Soros, who he credits with having the deepest understaning of the nexus between economics and forex rates of&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="journal"></category></entry><entry><title>Market Notes, 26th June 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/market-notes-26th-june-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-06-26T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-06-26:/market-notes-26th-june-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;It&amp;#8217;s too&amp;nbsp;hot&lt;/h2&gt;

The 10 year Treasury future ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZN&lt;/span&gt;) is spookily flat. 
It looks like the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JGB&lt;/span&gt; future, that barely trades, because the BoJ has bought up all the bonds.
Nothing looks promising. The opposing forces of massive monetary stimulus and massive virus-created economic damage seem perfectly in balance, eliminating opportunities for&amp;nbsp;profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tidying&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contango trade, championed by Kuppy, has not aged well.
In situations like this, it is very hard to know what to do.
The simplest thing is to cut one&amp;#8217;s losses, which is what I&amp;#8217;d normally do, 
especially as it has never really made any money.
The alternative, though is to write some short-dated calls, to alleviate the short term pain, 
get some income, and keep the trade idea alive.

A some wag has pointed out, a long-term holding is a short-term idea that went horribly wrong.
You can read about Kuppy&amp;#8217;s thesis &lt;a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2020/03/19/crude-contango/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trading&amp;nbsp;ideas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; retail REITs surely have further to fall. Relative to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; retail space, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; has a giant amount.
It&amp;#8217;s really expensive to short REITs because of the huge yield they have. 
The Simon Property Group was recently trading at a 15% yield. 
That&amp;#8217;s an awful lot of carry.
Not sure what high-yielding stock could be used in a pair trade to offset this&amp;nbsp;effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Banks are in a terrible state (because Euro long-term rates have been repressed forever, so there is no money any longer in maturity transformation: the main value traditionally added by banks). 
The problem is that if you try to take advantage of this, you&amp;#8217;re up against someone with a very big budget indeed:
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt;, with Madam Lagarde determined that banks won&amp;#8217;t fail on her watch. 
I plan to listen to &lt;a href="https://quoththeraven.podbean.com/e/quoth-the-raven-203-danielle-dimartino-booth/"&gt;this podcast&lt;/a&gt;. I started listening, and I heard &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DD&lt;/span&gt;-B explain that J Powell wanted to do the right thing when he arrive, but that the system is simply too big for him to fight. Chris Irons is a loose cannon, but occasionally his interviews are worth listening to, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMHO&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s the end of the week. 
Equities seem to sag towards the close.
This is fairly common: longs taking profits?
Gold up a bit.
Kudlow on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; claiming that all statistics point to a V-shaped recovery.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; seems to be talking about requiring visitors from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; to be quarantined, in contrast to most other visitors.
Trump behaving oddly: staying in Washington, not appearing at a news conference: Twitter is full of conspiracy theories, but in all probability he just can&amp;#8217;t be bothered to shlep over to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NY&lt;/span&gt; or Florida, given the heat and the&amp;nbsp;virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To counter the &amp;#8220;stocks only go up&amp;#8221; narrative, in fact they have gone nowhere in a couple of years, with the exception of the &amp;#8220;Giant Five.&amp;#8221; Wolf Richer points this out, but I&amp;#8217;m too lazy to find the link. He has also produced a post on how insanely uncertain managers are about future sales. Something not exactly&amp;nbsp;surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://compoundadvisors.com/2020/are-tech-stocks-immune-to-recession?ck_subscriber_id=694496162"&gt;Charlie Bilello points out&lt;/a&gt; that tech stocks have certainly not been immune to a downturn in the past, and are (surely) unlikely to be this&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks like cases are going up in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, or at least the headlines signal this. Maybe the reality is more&amp;nbsp;nuanced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wirecard&amp;nbsp;reverberations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple going fully &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARM&lt;/span&gt;-based and fabricating its own chips, dumping Intel.  My feelings are that it sees PCs as a segment it wants to get out of, so if the switch doesn&amp;#8217;t work,  it doesn&amp;#8217;t really matter because the segment makes a very minor contribution to the bottom line anyway. If it does work, Tim Apple will be hailed as a genius (again), this time for breaking free of nasty big-tech Intel (even though $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt; itself is the most predatory of the lot, and has much more pricing power over its customers, who are consumers, than Intel&amp;nbsp;does).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GNC&lt;/span&gt; goes bust (vitamin supplement&amp;nbsp;shops).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of countries relaxing lockdown, including the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks generally up a bit on end of lockdown news, but should we sell on the&amp;nbsp;news?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heard a podcast yesterday where &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BradDunkley"&gt;Brad Dunkley&lt;/a&gt; was arguing that everyone is so smart 
nowadays that it&amp;#8217;s impossible for an ordinary investor to profit from a fraud:
it&amp;#8217;s all in the price, so you actually should buy stocks you think are frauds.
Well, it sort of makes sense, and it would have worked recently.
The guy sounded very smart but pleasant: not at all arrogant.  He can&amp;#8217;t spell &amp;#8220;(coal) seam&amp;#8221; though!
He had some very nice anecdotes about baseball card&amp;nbsp;collecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPACs are getting a lot of attention of late.
&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LQLUy21Y14CcYyuYgKJcf9OQ4QWCs_w6PX-jDqhcejQ/edit#gid=0"&gt;This spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt; gives a list.
They are basically dry powder set up as an acquisition vehicle for the next unicorn.
Invest at your peril! (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TBH&lt;/span&gt;, I know next to nothing about these, and if their target fails, presumably you get your money back so do your own&amp;nbsp;research!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Markets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indexes seem to be drifting lower. It might be worth buying an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OOM&lt;/span&gt; put. 
Just a cheap one &amp;#8230; maybe noe: if I&amp;#8217;ve learned anything, it&amp;#8217;s to not try to go against the trend,
even if the trend it totally&amp;nbsp;irrational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold has been a pretty solid performer lately. The barbarous relic is holding its&amp;nbsp;own!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; stocks are selling on a very heavy yield now. Value has been beaten down.
Maybe it&amp;#8217;s worth&amp;nbsp;buying? &lt;/p&gt;

The reason is not clear, but it may simply be that people have no idea how to value the index and price it off the naive published&amp;nbsp;P/E.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bonds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No real sign of inflation yet, but bonds are failing to sustain their rallies, and so writing some call spreads on longer dated treasuries (or futures on them) might be worth investigating. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; government, not unlike all the others, will be having to sell a lot of treasuries in the coming months and years to pay for all the Covid relief measures, so the Bond Bulls are not going to be in the ascendant, even if the economy is weak, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMHO&lt;/span&gt;. If the economy is strong, nobody will want to invest in bonds as the returns to equity will be much&amp;nbsp;greater.&lt;/p&gt;

I, Who Hates Shorting, Just Shorted the Entire Stock Market. Here’s Why &lt;/a&gt;.
I wish him luck. It&amp;#8217;s very hard to make money by shorting.
You&amp;#8217;d generally do a lot better by selecting an investment &lt;a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/daytrading-icon-portnoy-now-using-random-scrabble-letters-pick-stock"&gt;by drawing random Scrabble letters&lt;/a&gt;. 
But we&amp;#8217;ve got to such a crazy state of the market, with the Nasdaq hitting all time highs as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; unemployment is about to hit 20%, that it has to make sense, even if I&amp;#8217;m too chicken to do&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="creditbubblebulletin.blogspot.com/2020/06/weekly-commentary-update-covid-19.html"&gt;The Credit Bubble Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;, in spite of it&amp;#8217;s low-tech web presence, is a great summary of what has been happening in the markets over the previous week.
It produces a new report every day, but only in link form. Doug Noland, the author brings everything together in a text report every week. 
The interesting thing about last week was how uninteresting it was. Neither equity nor &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FI&lt;/span&gt; markets budged very much.
Covid is still a serious problem.
Economic stats are still full of doom and gloom, although slightly less of these than in the recent past.
A lot of people are saying that we&amp;#8217;re at a turning point. It&amp;#8217;s certainly the case that for smooth functions,
the extremum is characterized by the rate of change dropping to zero.
Even if this is true, there is still time to act.
I am still cross about Wirecard, or more specifically that although I almost knew it was a Ponzi scheme, I made a lot less money out of it than the bulls. I think it has gone down, but in this market it will probably end up 
as one of &lt;a href="https://www.barstoolbets.com/topics/davey-day-trader-global"&gt;Davey Day Trader Global&lt;/a&gt; picks from his bag of Scrabble letters, and shoot back&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this market, it seems safe to keep out, or at best sell some vol, hedging out the equity&amp;nbsp;exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Bolton&amp;#8217;s book got a lot of coverage in the weekend papers.
How anyone can think it&amp;#8217;s news that someone close to Trump has concluded that he&amp;#8217;s stunningly ignorant
and unsuited to be the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;POTUS&lt;/span&gt; is beyond me.

another article which points out that risk on/risk off now dominates all
securities markets. 
Fed expansion pushes investors into risk on markets, and even in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt;,
traditionally a much bigger and liquid market than equities,
the risk-on/risk-off narrative dominates price&amp;nbsp;discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is a quadruple-witching day, with expiries of futures and options and two
other mystery derivatives. Usually, this is an exciting time. Time to adopt the brace&amp;nbsp;position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thefelderreport.com/2020/06/17/a-dangerous-gap-has-opened-up-for-u-s-equities/?mc_cid=dbda4a3d4c&amp;amp;mc_eid=8d66df2c11"&gt;Another note on why &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; markets are irrationally exuberant&lt;/a&gt;. Of course I agree, but I&amp;#8217;ve been reading articles saying more or less the same thing for a couple of decades, or at least it seems that&amp;nbsp;way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;J Powell eases off the&amp;nbsp;throttle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/06/18/fed-ends-qe-total-assets-drop-liquidity-injection-ends/"&gt;Fed Ends &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt;, Total Assets Drop. Liquidity Injection Ends&lt;/a&gt; published yesterday by Wolf Richer explains that for all the hoopla the Fed actually shrank it&amp;#8217;s balance sheet last week,
and that in future funds will start to flow into programmes to support consumption.
We might get a pick up in consumer price inflation, and a drop in stocks,
but it&amp;#8217;s certainly too early to take action on&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is on top of the fact that as the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UST&lt;/span&gt; starts to issue its trillions of dollars worth of bonds to finance fiscal activism, it will drain liquidity out of the system that would otherwise be used to buy&amp;nbsp;stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unemployment in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; running at 20%,&amp;nbsp;maybe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/06/18/my-reasonable-approximation-for-the-unemployment-rate-week-13-of-the-u-s-labor-market-collapse/"&gt;Estimate from Wolf Richer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Politics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2226adc7-f897-4fa3-abdc-ba2ca2183cfc?segmentId=114a04fe-353d-37db-f705-204c9a0a157b"&gt;Bolton reveals closely guarded secret that Trump is a narcissistic idiot who thinks of nothing but getting re-elected&lt;/a&gt; and succeeds in  having the book banned to improve&amp;nbsp;sales.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/18/ex-facebook-vp-regulators-big-tech.html"&gt;Ex-Facebook &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VP&lt;/span&gt; Chamath Palihapitiya thinks governments will go after Big Tech and break them up within a decade&lt;/a&gt;.
This is why the FAANGs spend billions on lobbying. 
They are very powerful, and have bought up politicians in bulk, so if Palihapitiya is right it will be the result of an unprecedentedly dedication from politicians to put the public good ahead of their own narrow&amp;nbsp;self-interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What happened&amp;nbsp;today?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My long-vol strategy failed me today, but not seriously. 
This is particularly odd, given that there was very low vol. in the markets today,
nearly all markets drifting gently&amp;nbsp;downwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newswise, nothing much to report. Bolton&amp;#8217;s book is still not out.
Pelosi is piloting a $1.5Trn stimulus bill through Congress.
All the CBs continue to buy bonds, but seemingly can&amp;#8217;t hold down rates, at least for more than a day or&amp;nbsp;so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold still can&amp;#8217;t break out, in spite of everything.
Commodities continue to be subdued, although the oil complex is up, especially gasoline,
which is 3.1% up (as of mid eve. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What will happen&amp;nbsp;tomorrow?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I knew the answer to this, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t type it here.
But this evening, I am more puzzled than ever. 
Equity indexes seem depressed, but not dramatically. 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt; is down 0.25%; the Nasdaq flickers around zero, having outperformed the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; for some while.
At some point, investors will judge the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; to be fairly priced, at least on a relative basis,
but we haven&amp;#8217;t got there yet.
The Brazilian index (Bovespa) is up against the trend, and the currency (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BRE&lt;/span&gt;) is down, as foretold.

They probably are worth looking into a bit. Some are very small, so one would be mad to have more than a tiny flutter on those. 
There is some evidence that an old drug helps those who are on ventilators as a result of catching Covid-19. 
A slender pillar to support a&amp;nbsp;rally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some news of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; govt. cutting some spending on pensions.
Powell gave some testimony to the Congress banking committee, didn&amp;#8217;t say very much of note (as far as I can tell).
Stocks grind higher.
The appearance before the Senate banking panel seems not to have yet caused any excitement.
From the odd fevered comment on Twitter he&amp;#8217;s doubling down. 
I saw something about him saying that he did not see any shrinking of the balance sheet,
which is scarcely&amp;nbsp;controversial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interesting&amp;nbsp;reads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/06/01/rents-in-the-most-expensive-cities-drop-oil-patch-gets-hit-too-but-massive-gains-in-other-cities/"&gt;This article on apartment rent levels in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; came out a while ago. Wolf Richer produces some amazing research. 
I&amp;#8217;m not really interested in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; rental market, but it might shed some light on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; one,

&lt;p&gt;Trading ideas: I have a vague idea that MLPs are going down. 
I heard someone on a podcast, or caught some Twitter post saying that these were a tax-driven structure that would not survive a downturn. My understanding is that they are bit like REITs for pipelines. 
Obviously, I just need to find out a bit more about them.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMLP&lt;/span&gt; is a big &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; of these things. 
I collected together a  Koyfin dashboard of ETFs &lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5ee87e9f670b897849a9499d"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. 
I struggle with Koyfin to click through to research. 
With a dividend yield of ~15%, and a P/E of ~8 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MPLX&lt;/span&gt; looks good value, but with a 1-year return of -30% maybe the stock does not come without risk.
It&amp;#8217;s cheap now, and had an up day yesterday (up 6%) so shorting would be a risky&amp;nbsp;proposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/netflix-stock-is-still-a-buy-says-one-analyst-51592265084"&gt;This is the bull case&lt;/a&gt;.
If you google &amp;#8220;fraud mlp&amp;#8221; you get a lot of hits.
It seems that a lot of MLPs are destined to convert to corporations.
They do seem to be a very complex sort of security, but they are a lot cheaper now than they were and, possibly, 
energy is poised for a pullback. 
My conclusion, for the moment, is that they should be avoided as an investment, either on the long or the short&amp;nbsp;side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone has a view, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DM&lt;/span&gt; me,&amp;nbsp;@stevehem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Market&amp;nbsp;comment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed announced it&amp;#8217;d start buying individual corporate bonds yesterday (rather than paying fat fees to BlackRock to assemble them into ETFs, which would be given a free credit insurance by the Treasury). This provoked a bounce.
Then, overnight, Trump announced another $1Trn in infrastructure spending.
As far as Trump and his cronies go, they certainly believe doing whatever it takes (in terms of spending tax dollars) to get him re-elected. But, as Kevin Muir always says, we&amp;#8217;re here to guess what will happen, not what we think should&amp;nbsp;happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My tentative response was to get as delta neutral as possible, with respect to equities, while writing a few tiny calls on the more insane penny stocks. You can see a list &lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5ee0b537c8647bc77bd4d9fb"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; but many of these don&amp;#8217;t have options as they they are not really&amp;nbsp;companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My feeling is that with so much dollar printing, real assets and non-dollar currencies should do well, but picking the right ones might be tricky.
Silver and gold have not yet taken off. At some point, I think they might, but patience is a&amp;nbsp;virtue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vix&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I occasionally go long the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; futures, via puts.
It has worked, but with the Fed fire brigade, it&amp;#8217;s difficult to pull this off.
Any sign of the market getting twitchy and a new Fed facility is announced.
I sold a single fix put (actually, a put on a nearby &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt; future but &amp;#8230;). This uses up a lot of collateral, but with an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IV&lt;/span&gt; of 127% it seemed safe(ish). With J Powell &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; S Mnuchin appointed as the leaders of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIX&lt;/span&gt;-killers, maybe I&amp;#8217;ll live to regret&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bonds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds normally are negatively correlated with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; and this relationship has held even over the last crazy six months.
I cannot help but wonder whether at some point the Fed will lose control of the yield curve. 
I know that the BoJ has carried it off, but the Yen is not the dollar and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; is running a big current account deficit. We shall&amp;nbsp;see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;SPACs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably don&amp;#8217;t want to know what these are. 
If you really don&amp;#8217;t want to take my advice, join &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/"&gt;r/SPACs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;End of&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can see now (19:20 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt;), we&amp;#8217;ve had a 100% risk-on day. Every equity market on the planet, with the exception of Brazil, is up. Commods (except precious metals) are up. 
I don&amp;#8217;t understand Brazil. 
Bonds are down, at least Treasuries, but not by much, which indicates that the smart money is not convinced that the pandemic is over.
I don&amp;#8217;t understand how J Powell can boost stock prices in Tokyo, but a rising tide lifts all boats, I&amp;nbsp;guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My call selling is not a disaster, but is yet to pay off in spades. It&amp;#8217;s very expensive in terms of capital, so I am not inclined to scale it&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;

I don&amp;#8217;t pretend to be an expert on this, but I feel that the bond market &amp;#8216;knows&amp;#8217; a lot more than the equity market,
which aggregates so many opposing&amp;nbsp;forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zillow ($Z) might be worth a lot: deep moat. See &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guessworkinvest/status/1272593240949063680"&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed intervening again.  More bad news around $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;, stock goes up. Not bullish for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds can&amp;#8217;t rally. 30-year Treasuries are struggling. Worth&amp;nbsp;shorting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrap: crazy day with the bears (rational investors) in a life-or-death struggle with bulls (deploying their crack troops: the Fed and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury). 
It&amp;#8217;s hard to get ripped to pieces by one of these massive forces, but for the moment the bulls are in the ascendant.

&lt;p&gt;At 6pm &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BST&lt;/span&gt; a lot of the bounce had gone out of the equities market although most sectors were still up.
Healthcare and pharma were not so bouncy, presumably because they&amp;#8217;ve previously bounced so far.
Commodities were mostly up, except gold, which follows from this being a risk-off day.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTI&lt;/span&gt; crude was basically flat. It is at 36, having jumped from 12.4 on 28 April. A long way&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar is up a bit. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; currencies seem relatively&amp;nbsp;strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JNK&lt;/span&gt;) is up and sovereign (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZN&lt;/span&gt;) is down, all consistent with this being a modestly risk-on&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;, having briefly exceeded the market cap of Toyota, is sinking again. 
The stock is pumped relentlessly by Musk, but there are many stories that he can&amp;#8217;t keep this up 
much longer, as more and more of his key staff jump&amp;nbsp;ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Things I was reading and listening&amp;nbsp;to:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listed to the 13 March edition of &lt;a href="https://markethuddle.com/"&gt;The Market Huddle&lt;/a&gt;. To his great credit, 
Kevin Muir correctly called the bounce of equity markets off the lows, 
and identified the cause: extravagant money creation by the Fed.&amp;nbsp;Respect! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BLM&lt;/span&gt; and pulling down statues seem to be the dominant themes, but people are getting excited about the pubs opening and singletons being allowed to&amp;nbsp;socialize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Market&amp;nbsp;Plunge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; is down 4.5%, which used to be quite a lot. The yield curve is back to where it was a month&amp;nbsp;ago&lt;/p&gt;

People &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTFD&lt;/span&gt;. But it could be a true break.

Michael Green is a very original thinker. Nice to hear Ben Hunt getting referenced. He and Wolf Richer are two of my favourites, along with Matt Taibbi. Hopefully, these guys will start to get some mainstream&amp;nbsp;audiences.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that all sports have been cancelled by the lockdown, gamblers have turned to the (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;) stockmarket for entertainment.
I created &lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5ee0b537c8647bc77bd4d9fb"&gt;a Koyfin dashboard&lt;/a&gt; of day-trader favourite stocks.&amp;nbsp;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

This would be a horrible idea. 
Both these &amp;#8220;asset classes&amp;#8221; are &amp;#8220;marked to fantasy&amp;#8221; where companies are forever being sold to other players in the sector, at a markup designed to ensure that the originating fund maximizes its fees. It&amp;#8217;s basically fraud,

Ultimately, the Treasury &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; the Bank of England are going to end up as the bag holder.

&lt;p&gt;I tried to protect myself buy buying a few cheap &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESTX50&lt;/span&gt; puts. Not panicing yet.
We&amp;#8217;ve had pauses a lot of times since the Covid crash. Still slightly delta&amp;nbsp;positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have been re-reading &amp;#8220;How to trade in stocks.&amp;#8221; 
Livermore&amp;#8217;s main insight seems to be that prices know more than you do, 
so you should close losing positions and ignore both fundamentals (implicitly) and tips (explicitly and strongly expressed). 
He exhorts the trader to do their own investigation, but he seems entirely focussed on what we&amp;#8217;d now call technical analysis.
Having said this, he clearly paid attention to the news and fundamentals.
It seems to me logical to trade only when the case is strong from both a technical and fundamental perspective.
Of course, charts are noisy, especially single stocks.
Livermore&amp;#8217;s argument about &amp;#8220;following the leaders&amp;#8221; is, I think, really about not ignoring the broader market. In his day, there were, I guess, no continuously updated prices for indexes, so he used a large stock as a proxy, which is probably the least bad option unless you want to be limited to once-a-day lagged&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Perpetual Voting&amp;nbsp;Machine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fleckensteincapital.com/dailyrap.aspx?rapdate=06-08-2020"&gt;Yesterday&amp;#8217;s Daily Rap&lt;/a&gt;, from Bill Fleckenstein was a bit more interesting than usual.
It pointed out that with massive &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt;, there is no longer any price discovery in Fixed Income (this is literally true for JGBs where the BoJ explicitly trades against the market to keep the ten-year yield at exactly 0, plus or minus a few bps).
Fleck argues that with passive equity investing now dominating all purchases, 
and this being largely funded by cheap money courtesy of the Fed (via margin loans for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; purchase, or maybe futures),  it&amp;#8217;s really quite logical that &amp;#8220;stonks only go up&amp;#8221;
(&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stoolpresidente/status/1268901809130700808?s=20"&gt;as Dave Portnoy claims&lt;/a&gt;). 
Well, yes, but at some point, people want to spend their gains. 
Maybe they&amp;#8217;ll just use them as collateral. 
Maybe this can go on for a long time.
Maybe Stein&amp;#8217;s Law is not broken, just&amp;nbsp;delayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In trading, it&amp;#8217;s very important to anticipate what will happen, and avoid even thinking about what should happen. 
Even if you can&amp;#8217;t help thinking about what should happen, and are seduced into action by the thought,
at least have the humility to reverse your action when the market says that you are wrong. 
And, remember, being too early is just another way of being wrong. 
It can take the market a long time to start to act&amp;nbsp;rationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It finally occurred to me that maybe &lt;strong&gt;studying losses was more
important than searching for some Holy Grail to making money&lt;/strong&gt;. So I
started reading through all the material on the pros again and noted
what they had to say about&amp;nbsp;losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My basic advice is don’t lose money. (Jim&amp;nbsp;Rogers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m more concerned about controlling the downside. Learn to take the
    losses. The most important thing in making money is not letting your
    losses get out of hand. (Marty&amp;nbsp;Schwartz)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’m always thinking about losing money as opposed to making money.
    Don’t focus on making money; focus on protecting what you have.
    (Paul Tudor&amp;nbsp;Jones)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One investor’s two rules of investing: Never lose money. Never
    forget rule #1. (Warren&amp;nbsp;Buffett)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The majority of unskilled investors stubbornly hold onto their
    losses when the losses are small and reasonable. They could get out
    cheaply, but being emotionally involved and human, they keep waiting
    and hoping until their loss gets much bigger and costs them dearly.
    (William&amp;nbsp;O’Neil)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn how to take losses quickly and cleanly. Don’t expect to be
    right all the time. If you have a mistake, cut your loss as quickly
    as possible. (Bernard&amp;nbsp;Baruch)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The pros could all make money in contradictory ways because they all
knew how to control their losses.&lt;/strong&gt; While one person’s method was making
money, another person with an opposite approach would be losing — if the
second person was in the market. And that’s just it; the second person
wouldn’t be in the market. He’d be on the sidelines with a nominal loss.
The pros consider it their primary responsibility not to lose&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning how not to lose money is more important than learning how to
make&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You kept your portfolio pretty much delta neutral, and you proved that this squelched 
all the risk, and all the return&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gradually, as it became apparent that investors perceive recent changes as signalling that the pandemic is coming to an end, you took off the risk-off hedges. You are long &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MXEA&lt;/span&gt; via calls. You have got some exposure to commodities via tankers etc. You&amp;#8217;ve missed out on some spectacular breakouts (e.g. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HYG&lt;/span&gt;, Chesapeake), but you&amp;#8217;ve avoided losing money.  Definitely getting more bullish about Latin America, as a beaten-down region and as an inflation&amp;nbsp;hedge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend you listened to Louis-Vincent Gave extolling the virtues of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; bonds, and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; as a new currency zone, plus Kuppy talking about guns and bitcoins. You listened to Max Kieser talking about bitcoins and gold to Chris Irons, but this was almost entirely for the entertainment value. Kieser has a point, though, talking about why we always bail out the creditors and never the&amp;nbsp;debtors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems weird to see markets rallying as city centres descend into chaos because of Black Lives Matters demos following the death of George Floyd (not the most attractive of&amp;nbsp;martyrs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a random capture of what was&amp;nbsp;happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From Calculated&amp;nbsp;Risk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May employment report &amp;#8212; 2.5M jobs added. Against a much larger drop in April. Unemp. now&amp;nbsp;13.3%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8.9% of all mortgages in Covid forbearance. 7.1% of all &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSE&lt;/span&gt;-backed loans in&amp;nbsp;forbearance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday:
• At 8:30 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt;, 8:30 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt;: Employment Report for May.   The consensus is for 8,250,000 jobs lost, and for the unemployment rate to increase to&amp;nbsp;19.7%.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GS&lt;/span&gt; estimates that unemployment rose to&amp;nbsp;21.5%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lumber futures up, year over year&amp;nbsp;(!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;House prices up. Housing market surprisingly strong. Mortgage applications up. Purchase apps. up 9% yoy. 
Case Shiller points to 3.5% yoy increase. About 10% of renters not paying&amp;nbsp;rent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vehicle sales down&amp;#8230; a&amp;nbsp;lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSA&lt;/span&gt; is showing a massive drop in travel &amp;#8212; approx.&amp;nbsp;87%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenTable shows a big percentage increase in bookings,&amp;nbsp;unsurprisingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massive drop in spending: 13.6 (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BEA&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NY&lt;/span&gt; Fed forecasts a 40% decline in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; on a seasonally-adjusted annual&amp;nbsp;rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CharlieBilello&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2020 stockmarket so far: internet, internet commerce (incl payment services), biotech, health, all did well. Energy, travel, reits, airlines (some) did&amp;nbsp;badly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t write this wrap last week. The market was behaving much the same, as &lt;a href="http://creditbubblebulletin.blogspot.com/2020/05/weekly-commentary-scourge-of-whatever.html"&gt;last week&amp;#8217;s bulletin&lt;/a&gt; makes&amp;nbsp;clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massive short squeeze in the most exposed&amp;nbsp;stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge relief rally in Brazil Real, all emerging markets currencies and&amp;nbsp;stockmarkets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the pullback, the dollar has drifted down 1.4%, and treasuries are weak. The problem is that this may either be the typical risk off behaviour as investors move 
cash into risky assets like stocks &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; currencies or it may be that the market is getting a 
faint whiff of inflation on the&amp;nbsp;horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong currency and stockmarket have not participated in the rally, but have not crashed
since China has decided to increasingly impose its will on the former colony. 
I see a potential for the Hang Seng to sag dramatically, but it&amp;#8217;s too early to take&amp;nbsp;action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Civil unrest, following the George Floyd murder, seems good for stocks. Maybe the police could arrange something similar on a weekly&amp;nbsp;basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commercial real estate in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; is not in a good&amp;nbsp;place:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 1 – Financial Times (Joe Rennison): “The percentage of commercial property loans left unpaid by borrowers in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; more than trebled last month, in a sign of a deepening crisis in the $1.3tn market for bonds backed by the mortgages. The delinquency rate on loans underpinning commercial mortgage-backed securities rose from 2.3% in April to 7.4% in May, according to the data service Trepp. Borrowers are considered delinquent when they fail to make a payment within 30 days. A further 8.6% of mortgages were in that 30-day grace period after missing a&amp;nbsp;payment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging Market economies (as opposed to their currencies and stockmarkets) are in a worse&amp;nbsp;one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June 1 – New York Times (Mary Williams Walsh and Matt Phillips): “From Angola to Jamaica to Ecuador to Zambia, the world’s poor countries have had their finances shredded by the global pandemic. The president of Tanzania has called on ‘our rich brothers’ to cancel his country’s debt. Belarus veered toward a default when a promised $600 million loan from Russia fell through. Russia couldn’t spare the money because the ruble had taken a nose-dive… Lebanon, troubled even before the pandemic, has embarked on its first debt restructuring. And Argentina has defaulted again — for the ninth time in its history. The low interest rates of the past decade led to an unlikely alliance between poor countries and international investors. Governments, state-owned companies and other businesses were able to raise money relatively cheaply to finance their growth, while investors searching for better returns than they were getting at home gobbled up that debt. As a result, developing countries owe record amounts of money to investors, governments and others outside their borders: $2.1 trillion for countries ranked as ‘low income’ and ‘lower-middle income’ by the World&amp;nbsp;Bank…”&lt;/p&gt;

It really doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to be possible to make money on the short 
side outside of a bear market, and these never seem to persist for more than a couple of weeks nowadays. 
At some point, maybe, the Fed put will stop functioning, but it&amp;#8217;s still going strong right&amp;nbsp;now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has gone one for so long now, it hardly seems worth commenting on,
but having &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; markets (particularly the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASDAQ&lt;/span&gt;) hitting all-times highs when &lt;a href="https://www.frbatlanta.org/cqer/research/gdpnow"&gt;the Atlanta Fed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; now service&lt;/a&gt; is estimating a 50% drop in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; (annualized) is beyond incomprehensible, to me at&amp;nbsp;least. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that there are race riots in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; and that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; seems to be on the point of breaking off diplomatic relations with China over it&amp;#8217;s Hong Kong seems to be brushed off. See &lt;a href="https://www.frbatlanta.org/cqer/research/gdpnow"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;, for example. And &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2829fcc9-c8d6-4cd1-a558-ab964449609c"&gt;the fact that China seems to prefer to import its soybeans from Brazil&lt;/a&gt; rather than from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;, despite Trump negotiating the &amp;#8216;greatest deal ever&amp;#8217; for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; farmers a few months&amp;nbsp;ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4347706-you-want-stock-market-to-go-down"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; explains why all the evidence points to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; going down. All the evidence, except what actually is happening to it. It&amp;#8217;s worth watching out for Transports and Financials. Vol is still down, as I know to my&amp;nbsp;cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone (!) seems to be forecasting that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EUR&lt;/span&gt; will go up against the dollar, because the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; is moving to become a transfer union,
now that the pesky Brits are out of the way. That, and unless the Frugal Five (or Four) northern states agree to Italy et al. being bailed out the whole edifice will come crashing down, something that nobody in Europe wants (maybe apart from Victor Orban). I am not so convinced maybe Italy will get saved, but will this benefit the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EUR&lt;/span&gt; overall: I&amp;#8217;m not so sure. My preference would be the bombed out markets in Latin America. They make all sorts of commodities (like food) which we will still need, even in the depths of a&amp;nbsp;depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks I hold: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KL&lt;/span&gt; (via options), &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VALE&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FRO&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GLD&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STNG&lt;/span&gt;.

I listened to The Econtalk Episode in which Russ Roberts talks to Martin Gurri about his 2014 book, &amp;#8220;The Revolt of the Public&amp;#8221;. 
You can read the highlights &lt;a href="https://www.econtalk.org/martin-gurri-on-the-revolt-of-the-public/#audio-highlights"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic thesis is that Poltical Taylorism has had its day, and that our political elites don&amp;#8217;t know how
to move out of a 20th Century mindset in which they are at the top of a pyramid in which they control
everything, but especially&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t do justice to the interview, let alone the book (which I have not read, but would like to: it&amp;#8217;s in &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/30000791"&gt;my Goodreads list&lt;/a&gt;) in a short blog post, but if spending ten minutes writing this allows 
a few more people to benefit from the Gurri&amp;#8217;s insights I felt it would be time well&amp;nbsp;spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Gurri  is a former &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CIA&lt;/span&gt; [Central Intelligence Agency] analyst, a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; citizen, but also an immigrant from Cuba. 
He keeps saying that he is not a revolutionary, but he is clearly not a fan of the &lt;em&gt;status quo&lt;/em&gt;. 
He argues that the general distrust of politicians does not arise from people&amp;#8217;s lack of the basic necessities,
but actually from their arrogance and lack of morality: something that cannot be fixed with bread and circuses,
however hard the elites try. Mind you, free Netflix for everyone would go a long way&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interview is wonderfully wide-ranging. Where else could you find the 30-years War, the 30 pesos protest in Chile, the 30 Years War in 17th Century, the Treaty of Westphalia,
Brexit, the Arab Spring, Daniel Ortega, the 1968 global protest movement, the Bolshevik Revolution, 
Occupy Wall St., annihilism, les gilets jaunes, and protests in Tel Aviv, Arnold Kling all used to illustrate the underlying
argument that Gurri presents. Trump is mentioned, but only&amp;nbsp;fleetingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gurri talks about &amp;#8220;flattening the pyramid&amp;#8221; as the way forward: shortening the chain between rulers and the ruled. I am not convinced that this is enough, although I don&amp;#8217;t pretend to forecast how things will
pan out.
Popular revolution has always ended badly, with just another oligarchy at the top. The Internet is a big thing, but most individuals are
apathetic (or, to be less judgemental, rationally ignorant) and still 
just want to have a quiet life and enough to eat and drink. Bryan Caplan has written eloquently on&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example quote to whet your&amp;nbsp;appetite:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there needs to be something more fundamental than that, or let&amp;#8217;s say, less structural than that. And, that gets back to the Yuval Levin point, which is: there is something broken with our elites today. As is almost&amp;#8212;wanders into an area which I find very tricky, which is morality. All right? But, in the end, politics is determined by morality, by what we think is right and&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, as a bonus, we get to hear why  Russ Roberts is a great fan of the Netflix series &amp;#8220;The&amp;nbsp;Crown.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

This can be applied to investment, where an investment decision has a payoff probability distribution where a holding (e.g. of stock) 
will produce a range of possible returns, some positive and some negative. In the pages I&amp;#8217;ve looked at, the distribution is binomial, with two possible outcomes. I guess for a short period this is not wildly unrealistic, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t seem a good model for long term investors. I realize that a binomial distribution will end up as a normal one over&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairly intuitively, it&amp;#8217;s better not to put all your eggs in one basket, when there is a chance that that basket will drop to the floor. The lower the odds that you get the positive payoff, the less you allocate to that stock, the higher the edge the more you allocate. It all seems sensible, although the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMH&lt;/span&gt; says that you generally have no edge so you should not even try to do this sort of&amp;nbsp;thing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of interesting pages about this on the Interweb. Many future distributions can produce the same expected return. The St Petersburg paradox shows that generally we don&amp;#8217;t value these equally. 
The resolution to the paradox says that our utility, as a function of wealth, flattens. The Kelly criterion result can be derived by assuming that utility is a log function of&amp;nbsp;wealth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a tutorial, but a suggestion that it&amp;#8217;s worth studying these things, to improve your own understanding of risk, and return, and&amp;nbsp;utility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of economics is based on assuming that we are all utility-maximizing rational actors. I don&amp;#8217;t know how much the functional relationship between wealth and utility changes the predictions of economic models. If you know, tell&amp;nbsp;me! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be wonderful to take advantage of this situation, but with governments throughtout Europe pumping money into the corporate sector it&amp;#8217;s just too dangerous to be short&amp;nbsp;anything. &lt;/p&gt;

Without the inimitable Kevin Muir &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Patrick Ceresna, I would never have encountered this witty and thoughtful&amp;nbsp;Frenchman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deluard believes that it&amp;#8217;s different this time. That the demographic challenges facing the Boomers mean that their political dominance is coming to an end, 
and that inflation&amp;#8212;which has been suppressed by Boomer policies&amp;#8212;will be allowed to redisribute real resources from the old to the young (or, at least, the less&amp;nbsp;old). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a very clever thesis, but of course people have been predicting runaway inflation since the time of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FDR&lt;/span&gt;, and it hasn&amp;#8217;t really happened yet. Deluard makes a very persuasive argument, but I am aware that I need to be eternally vigilant to avoid confirmation&amp;nbsp;bias.&lt;/p&gt;

I think that Druck had previously said how grateful we should be for all these high-tech companies providing 
valuable services to us below cost (or, maybe in the case of Amazon, barely above cost). 
Well, yes, these are very convenient. At least for those who are banked, and have a computer, an internet
connection and a smartphone. It&amp;#8217;s nice of the providers of capital to pay for this.
But, hold on: we are the providers. We all are, &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt;, providers and consumers of&amp;nbsp;capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin Wolf in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; pointed out recently that all this debt, all this foregone consumption, is gone forever.
Nobody is going enjoy it in the future. Not current savers. Not their descendents (&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2c5ddbd0-8e09-11ea-9e12-0d4655dbd44f"&gt;Wolf channels Marriner Eccles&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always believed that the way to address extreme inequality in society is via a tax on capital transfers,
before and after death. I&amp;#8217;m arguing above that this won&amp;#8217;t be needed, but it would speed things up. 
It would also drive the rich to consume more, which is a good thing. I think it was Gibbon who said 
something along the lines of &amp;#8220;the consumption of luxury is a voluntary tax paid by the rich for the benefit of the&amp;nbsp;poor.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="blogs"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>But who will pay all these wages?</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/the_government_will_pay.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-18T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-05-18:/the_government_will_pay.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Who will&amp;nbsp;pay?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We seem to be returning to the 30s. But this time populist governments are desperate to keep voters on board.
So they have no option but to cushion unemployment. 
The big debate of the 30s was whether this would put off the evil day when the economy would have to be restructured in such a way that production was in equilibrium with desired&amp;nbsp;consumption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s remarkable how this sort of debate has been utterly forgotten&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have seen so many articles talking about what the government is going to spend its money on that I cannot even bother to think even to myself &amp;#8220;but the government has no resources of its own&amp;#8221;. Everytime politicians talk about spending money, it&amp;#8217;s not even &amp;#8220;taxpayers&amp;#8221; money, it&amp;#8217;s a transfer from one part of society to another. It&amp;#8217;s not even a matter of pushing the cost onto our children or grandchildren: we cannot pull forward resources from the future. We cannot consume now resources that will not be produced until our descendents are consumers: these resources simply do not exist, so they are not available to us even aided by the most magical incantations uttered by the Old Lady of Threadneedle&amp;nbsp;Street.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Immoveable objects</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/immoveable-objects.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-15T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-23T15:39:39+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-05-15:/immoveable-objects.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Bull and Bear, Immovable Object meets Irresistible Force.

He has collected together &lt;a href="/2020/dazed-and-confused"&gt;some recent data&lt;/a&gt; which shows just how enormous the C-19 disruption

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Anyone Who Isn&amp;#8217;t Confused Really Doesn&amp;#8217;t Understand the Situation&amp;#8221;
So for those itching to buy puts or short stocks, you really have to wait until there is some sign of a rollover in the market and some weakness that allows you to convince yourself that the rally has ended and that, in hindsight, it will be seen as a failing rally. (As a practical matter, someone &amp;#8212; in this case, me &amp;#8212; making the case that today&amp;#8217;s action was the end of the rally could short a few targets with nearby stops to see if the idea wants to&amp;nbsp;work.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may be restating the obvious, given all that I have said about this in the past, but I can tell in discussions with people that there are many who just can&amp;#8217;t fathom how we could be seeing what we&amp;#8217;re seeing, but that is the power of the printing press, as nebulous a concept as that may seem to&amp;nbsp;some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;While the impressive rally in risk assets may turn out to have been too much, too fast, given the tough road to normalisation, it is less likely that equities break their previous&amp;nbsp;low.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

It argues that the Fed may be getting in too deep and that, like Kennedy deciding to go 
into Vietnam, it&amp;#8217;s a lot easier for governments and quasi-governmental institutions to start
a policy than to finish&amp;nbsp;it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Twittersphere, at least the tiny corner of it that I visit, 
has been saying more or less the same thing for months, 
or even years (Northman Trader, Jesse Columbo, Ben Hunt, 7x2fB, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QTR&lt;/span&gt;, Peter Schiff &amp;#8212; uncountable commentors).
Up to now, they&amp;#8217;ve been considered rather fringe commentators,
but if we do see a spike in inflation, they&amp;#8217;ll be seen as visionary.
&lt;a href="http://creditbubblebulletin.blogspot.com/"&gt;The Credit Bubble Bulletin&lt;/a&gt; is a good source 
of current news from a Fed-sceptic point of view. 
Another good source is Wolf Richter, e.g. &lt;a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/05/06/nothings-fixed-whats-behind-the-corporate-debt-bailout/"&gt;
Nothing’s Fixed: What’s Behind the Corporate Debt Bailout &lt;/a&gt; published 6th May&amp;nbsp;2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s impossible for one person to get a perspective on what the general population think,
on average, about a new policy. My guess is that it&amp;#8217;s generally seen at the moment as
being the right&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Modelling Covid-19 and the&amp;nbsp;Climate&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some background in mathematically modelling, and I am much more sceptical of its
general usefulness than the average person.
I think that some of the Covid-19 modelling has low predictive value, because the input
parameters are so difficult to get right. I often think about this in the context of 
economic modelling, but &lt;a href="http://coyoteblog.com/coyote_blog/2020/04/another-climate-covid-computer-modelling-similarity.html"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; 
draws a comparison with climate modelling. All these things (infectious diseases, climate and the economy) 
are very complex systems. Modelling how they evolve is intrinsically difficult,
especially when humans are part of the system which is being&amp;nbsp;modelled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to fiddle a bit with Pelican to make it work &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; on Windows and
to allow me to use a custom domain on github. 
You can see the full gory details at&amp;nbsp;https://github.com/stevehemingway/stevehemingway.github.io.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The things that kept tripping me up were as&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;@echo in a makefile in Windows fails. Everything else is fine, but echo fails, 
because it&amp;#8217;s not a proper command. This is all explained &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20712307/echo-fails-in-make-on-windows"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
The solution, as suggested, is to stick a &amp;#8216;;&amp;#8217; at the end of each echo line,
forcing it to be treated like a command. 
I actually use Pelican both on Windows and Linux systems, so I didn&amp;#8217;t want
to break portability (although I would gladly have done so if there wasn&amp;#8217;t an easy&amp;nbsp;workaround).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not sufficient to tell github, via the settings, that you want to use a custom domain.
You have to have a file called &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNAME&lt;/span&gt; in the root of the project with the custom domain name.
You can read about this &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-a-subdomain"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
The key sentence is &amp;#8216;If you use a static site generator to build your site locally and push the generated files to GitHub, pull the commit that added the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNAME&lt;/span&gt; file to your local repository. For more information, see &amp;#8220;Troubleshooting custom domains and GitHub Pages.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8217; 
The problem is that Pelican just trashes all the files and removes the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNAME&lt;/span&gt; file every time the site is generated. It took me a painfully long time to work out what was going wrong. The fix was to insert an extra line into the makefile:&amp;nbsp;publish:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;PELICAN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;INPUTDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;-o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;OUTPUTDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;-s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;PUBLISHCONF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;PELICANOPTS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;OUTPUTDIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;/CNAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using github involves working on two branches, &lt;em&gt;master&lt;/em&gt;, which is the hard-coded branch name that github pages will always serve the site from, and another one, which I have called &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; (but is configurable in &lt;em&gt;pythonconf.py&lt;/em&gt;) which has the actual 
&amp;#8216;source&amp;#8217; for the website. The generated stuff in master still clutters the root directory, and you can&amp;#8217;t get rid of it because git won&amp;#8217;t let you push until you&amp;#8217;ve pulled (fnarr&amp;nbsp;fnarr). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s quite enough tech stuff for&amp;nbsp;today!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Stolen from Max Nova’s Review of Jim Paul’s Book</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/million.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-10T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-05-10:/million.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pinched all this from 
&lt;a href="http://books.max-nova.com/losing-a-million-dollars/"&gt;Max Nova&amp;#8217;s Review&lt;/a&gt;. 
I plan to somehow use this as the basis of some&amp;nbsp;articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOREWORD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trading, as far as I know, is the only endeavor in which the rank
amateur has a 50/50 chance of being right.&lt;/strong&gt; Why? Because there are only
two things you could do in trading: you can buy or you can&amp;nbsp;sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PREFACE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moral of the story you are about to read is: Success can be built
upon repeated failures when the failures aren’t taken personally;
likewise, failure can be built upon repeated successes when the
successes are taken&amp;nbsp;personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personalizing successes sets people up for disastrous failure.&lt;/strong&gt; They
begin to treat the successes totally as a personal reflection of their
abilities rather than the result of capitalizing on a good opportunity,
being at the right place at the right time, or even being just plain
lucky. They think their mere involvement in an undertaking guarantees&amp;nbsp;success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can’t really be set up for disaster without having it preceded by&amp;nbsp;success.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PART&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ONE&lt;/span&gt; - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;REMINISCENCES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OF&lt;/span&gt; A &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TRADER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience is the worst teacher. It gives the test before giving the
lesson. —&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UNKNOWN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drucker has also said, “Success always obsoletes the behavior that
achieved&amp;nbsp;it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to Herb Kelleher, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; of Southwest Airlines: “I think the easiest
way to lose success is to become convinced that you are&amp;nbsp;successful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart people learn from their mistakes and wise people learn from
somebody else’s&amp;nbsp;mistakes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1 - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HUNGER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became Johnny’s personal caddy, which is how I got out of Elsmere,
Kentucky, the first time in my&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2 - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;REAL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WORLD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was accepted to the University of Kentucky in&amp;nbsp;1961.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3 - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WOOD&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THAT&lt;/span&gt; I &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WOULD&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TRADE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anytime you see a committee of more than ten, it isn’t the real
committee. There’s a subcommittee somewhere making the&amp;nbsp;decisions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had only been in town six months, and I was elected because I had
presence, wore a vest and $80 shoes, knew a lot about the markets, and
knew a lot of people in the&amp;nbsp;industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of us were doing some business with Potlatch, a huge
paper-manufacturing and lumber firm in the&amp;nbsp;northwest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The vast majority of the successes in my life were because I got
lucky&lt;/strong&gt;, not because I was particularly smart or better or different. I
didn’t know it at this point in the story, but I sure as hell was about
to find&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4 - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPECTACULAR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPECULATOR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arabian horse fiasco cost me about $50,000 before it was over. Here
I was thinking I could make money in Arabian horses, and I couldn’t even
ride&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the oldest rules of trading is: If a market is hit with very
bullish news and instead of going up, the market goes down, get out if
you’re long. &lt;strong&gt;An unexpected and opposite reaction means there is
something seriously wrong with the&amp;nbsp;position.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was making money, I couldn’t wait for the market to open. When I
was losing money, I couldn’t wait for it to close. &lt;strong&gt;Time is very
painful when you’re losing&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can remember sitting at my desk crying as they started to strip the
office. It was the absolute lowest point in my life. I had gone from
having everything on August 31 to nothing on November&amp;nbsp;17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5 - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QUEST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The money I’d made over the years “trading” wasn’t because I was a good
trader. I’d made money because of being a good sales man, being at the
right place at the right time, and knowing the right people, rather than
because of some innate trading&amp;nbsp;ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOTE&lt;/span&gt;: Lots of contradictory advice about how to make&amp;nbsp;money]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I haven’t met a rich technician. (Jim&amp;nbsp;Rogers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I always laugh at people who say, ‘I’ve never met a rich
    technician.’ I love that! It is such an arrogant, nonsensical
    response. I used fundamentals for nine years and then got rich as a
    technician. (Marty&amp;nbsp;Schwartz)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diversify your investments. (John&amp;nbsp;Templeton)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diversification is a hedge for ignorance. (William&amp;nbsp;O’Neil)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concentrate your investments. If you have a harem of 40 women you
    never get to know any of them very well. (Warren&amp;nbsp;Buffett)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have to understand the business of a company you have invested
    in, or you will not know whether to buy more if it goes down. (Peter&amp;nbsp;Lynch)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Averaging down is an amateur strategy that can produce serious
    losses. (William&amp;nbsp;O’Neil)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t bottom fish. (Peter&amp;nbsp;Lynch)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t try to buy at the bottom or sell at the top. (Bernard&amp;nbsp;Baruch)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe the trend is your friend for a few minutes in Chicago, but for
    the most part it is rarely a way to get rich. (Jim&amp;nbsp;Rogers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I believe the very best money is made at the market turns. Everyone
    says you get killed trying to pick tops and bottoms and you make all
    the money by catching the trends in the middle. Well, for twelve
    years I have often been missing the meat in the middle, but I have
    caught a lot of bottoms and tops. (Paul Tudor&amp;nbsp;Jones)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you’re not sure what is going to happen in the market it is
    wise to protect yourself by going short in something you think is
    overvalued. (Roy&amp;nbsp;Neuberger)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether I am bullish or bearish, I always try to have both long and
    short positions—just in case I’m wrong. (Jim&amp;nbsp;Rogers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have tried being long a stock and short a stock in the same
    industry but generally found it to be unsuccessful. (Michael&amp;nbsp;Steinhardt)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many traders have the idea that when they are in a commodity (or
    stock), and it starts to decline, they can hedge and protect
    themselves, that is, short some other commodity (or stock) and make
    up the loss. There is no greater mistake than this. (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;W. D.&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Gann)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PART&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TWO&lt;/span&gt; - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LESSONS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LEARNED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good judgment is usually the result of experience, and experience
frequently the result of bad judgment. —&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROBERT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOVETT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losing money in the markets is the result of either: (1) some fault in
the analysis or (2) some fault in its&amp;nbsp;application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 8 explains that &lt;strong&gt;emotions are neither good nor bad; they simply
are. Emotions per se cannot be avoided. Emotionalism, on the other hand,
can and should be&amp;nbsp;avoided.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6 - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSYCHOLOGICAL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DYNAMICS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOSS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So between August 1983 and August 1984, I lost all of my money; went
$400,000 in debt; lost my membership, my job, my Board of Governor’s
seat, my Executive Committee seat, and both of my parents. I lost
everything that was important to me except my wife and kids. That was
not a good twelve&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Losses per se don’t bother them; unexpected losses and losing on
balance&amp;nbsp;does.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;strong&gt;if you lose as a participant of a game, you weren’t wrong; you
were defeated&lt;/strong&gt;. If you lose as a spectator of a game, you must have
placed a bet (or expressed an opinion) on the game’s outcome and you
lost money (or were wrong), but you were not&amp;nbsp;defeated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, all losses can be categorized either as (1) internal, such as
self-control, esteem, love, your mind, or (2) external, such as a bet, a
game or contest, money. External losses are objective, and internal
losses are&amp;nbsp;subjective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When my father was dying, a friend of mine gave me a book about people
with terminal illnesses titled On Death and Dying, by Elisabeth&amp;nbsp;Kübler-Ross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;7 - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSYCHOLOGICAL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FALLACIES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RISK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people who think they are investing are speculating. And most
people who think they are speculating are gambling. —&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UNKNOWN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big difference is: gambling creates risk while
investing/speculating assumes and manages risk that already&amp;nbsp;exists.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the distinguishing characteristic of a bettor or a gambler is
whether he wants the satisfaction of being right in his prediction or
the entertainment of participating,&amp;nbsp;respectively.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;8 - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSYCHOLOGICAL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CROWD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nineteenth-century philosopher Gustave Le Bon put it this way:
“Crowds are somewhat like the sphinx of ancient fable: it is necessary
to arrive at a solution to the problem offered by their psychology or
resign ourselves to being devoured by&amp;nbsp;them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rather, we need a model to alert us to when we are becoming part of a&amp;nbsp;crowd.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ordinarily, greed and fear are cited as the two driving emotions of
market participants. However, hope and fear are the primary emotions;
greed is simply hope run&amp;nbsp;amok.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PART&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THREE&lt;/span&gt; - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TYING&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TOGETHER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;9 - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RULES&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TOOLS&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOOLS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you occasionally break the rules and still have an unbroken string of
successes, you are likely to compound the problem because you assume
that you are better than other people and above the rules. Your ego
inflates, and you refuse to recognize the reality of a loss when it
comes. You assume that you will be&amp;nbsp;right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the words of financial editor James Grant, &lt;strong&gt;“Because the future is
always unfathomable, there are always buyers and sellers in every
market. If the socialists were right — if the future could be accurately
divined — markets would disband because nobody would ever take the
losing side of a&amp;nbsp;trade.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When dealing with the risk of the uncertainty of the future, you have
three choices: engineering, gambling, or&amp;nbsp;speculating.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculating is the application of intellectual examination and
systematic analysis to the problem of the uncertain future. &lt;strong&gt;Successful
investing is the result of successful&amp;nbsp;speculation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan put it this way: &lt;strong&gt;“The historic
purpose of banking is to take prudent risks through the extension of
loans to risk taking businesses.”&lt;/strong&gt; In other words, the bankers are&amp;nbsp;speculating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I can’t get out here, I’m losing too much,” is the worst thing you’ll
hear a trader or investor say!&lt;/strong&gt; What he is saying is: he’s getting
absolutely crushed, crucified, and buried, and he can’t get out of the
market because he’s getting crushed, crucified, and buried. That’s
stupid. Anytime someone says he can’t get out because he’s losing too
much, &lt;strong&gt;he has personalized the market&lt;/strong&gt;; he just doesn’t want to lose
face by realizing the&amp;nbsp;loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In contrast to what most people do, your entry point should be a
function of the exit&amp;nbsp;point.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, “profitable trades” that are missed actually cost zero while
poor controls (pick the stop later) or no controls (no stop) will sooner
or later cost you a lot of&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A plan that determines the stop-loss first enables you to convert a
naturally dangerous, continuous process into a finite, discrete&amp;nbsp;event.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having a plan requires thinking, which only an individual can do—not a&amp;nbsp;crowd.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The failure to have and follow a plan is the root cause of most of the
other “reasons” (or, more accurately, “excuses”) for losing money in the&amp;nbsp;markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his book Teaching Thinking, internationally renowned education expert
Edward de Bono says, “A person will use his thinking to keep himself
right. This is especially true with more able pupils whose ego has been
built up over the years on the basis that they are brighter than other
pupils. &lt;strong&gt;Thinking is no longer used as an exploration of the subject
area but as an ego support device.&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philosopher-novelist Ayn Rand was asked one time in a radio interview
whether she thought gun-control laws violated the Second Amendment right
to bear arms. “I don’t know,” she responded, “I haven’t thought about
it.” And she said it in a manner as though it was the most natural thing
in the world not to have an answer or opinion. &lt;strong&gt;Now here is one of the
towering geniuses of the twentieth century and the architect of an
entire philosophical system saying, “I don’t know.” Contrast her
approach to that of most people who have prepackaged intellectual
positions, views, opinions, and answers on almost every topic&lt;/strong&gt;,
gathered from television, newspapers, newsletters, and&amp;nbsp;conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, measured inconsistency is the key to winning in&amp;nbsp;poker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;POSTSCRIPT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A salesman’s ego gratification from being right is precisely what the
entrepreneur, Speculator, and manager must&amp;nbsp;avoid.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;there is a common denominator among this group: rather than
just taking risks, as is commonly assumed, they excel at judging,
minimizing, and controlling risks.&lt;/strong&gt; [re.&amp;nbsp;entrepreneurs]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formula for failure is not lack of knowledge, brains, skill, or hard
work, and it’s not lack of luck; it’s personalizing losses, especially
if preceded by a string of wins or profits. It’s refusing to acknowledge
and accept the reality of a loss when it starts to occur because to do
so would reflect negatively on&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category><category term="books"></category></entry><entry><title>What is the correct relationship between science, scientists, policy and politicians?</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/what-is-the-correct-relationship-between-science-scientists-policy-and-politicians.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-10T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:12+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-05-10:/what-is-the-correct-relationship-between-science-scientists-policy-and-politicians.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Why don&amp;#8217;t scientists go into&amp;nbsp;politics?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that almost no active national-level polician has any meaningful training in science 
(even at an undergraduate level, but certaintly not as a research scientist),
it&amp;#8217;s remarkable how so much of policy is claimed to be &amp;#8216;science&amp;nbsp;based&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists are trained to understand natural phenomena. 
Human behaviour, at least in aggregate, is outside of their sphere of competance.
Social sciences are not sciences, and the dismal science may be dismal, but it is not&amp;nbsp;science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science often develops models. Newton proposed a mathematical model of the relationship between 
the force on an object, and its acceleration (although some would argue that he simply refined the definition of &amp;#8216;force&amp;#8217;:
science often proceeds by redefining common natural language words in a way that non-scientists do not appreciate).
Models are useful for testing hypotheses. 
If a model is constructed which predicts measurable behavior, and that prediction matches experiment, 
the model is useful in establishing the assumptions that have gone into constructing it.
It does not prove the assumptions, because scientific hypothesis can never be definitively proved, only disproved.
Complex models, once calibrated, can be useful for practical purposes, like allowing engineers to design 
bridges that will not fall down under most plausible scenarios.
Simple models, however, also have an important place in science. 
They allow us to gain an insight into the underlying physical processes,
and allow us to have an intuitive understanding of the world in a broader sense.
Newton&amp;#8217;s Laws are not correct (Einstein and Schrodinger proved that) but they 
are much more useful for a practical understanding of the world we live in
than the more complex (but more complete) later&amp;nbsp;models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policy decisions need to be informed by an intuitive understanding of the very complex 
system in which we live as humans. This is why, for all the benefits of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSGE&lt;/span&gt; models in
economics, highly regarded commentators like Paul Krugman will use something like an 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IS&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LM&lt;/span&gt; model to formulate their policy recommendations. 
I seriously doubt if better policy will come out of better modelling,
because the better, and more complex models are so difficult to understand,
and because what they gain in realism they lose in being more highly 
parametrized (and therefore needing more&amp;nbsp;statistics).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current crisis, the progress of the disease is too dependent on
social norms to be easily modelled and even if modelling were possible,
the main problem is the political one of understanding how to trade off
deaths against economic pain. Although we already do this in the National Institute for Clinical Excellence
(the body that decides whether or not a new drug gives enough extra life to be worth the price demanded by the drug company),
politicians are understandably unwilling to talk openly about the monetary
of a saved&amp;nbsp;life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, in my view it&amp;#8217;s about time that politicians stopped hiding behind the lab coats of the scientists and made some decisions.
Complex models are not suited to guiding policy. We should listen to scientists but come to our own conclusions, just as we do with&amp;nbsp;economists.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>I’m back, sort of</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/im-back-sort-of.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-04T15:58:44+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:17:47+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-05-04:/im-back-sort-of.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Background to this&amp;nbsp;blog&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a pile of markdown stuff from my time as a councillor, which was turned into a website
using the hpstr template for jekyll. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TBH&lt;/span&gt;, I never really understood Jekyll, and I found hugo 
pretty difficult to use. I&amp;#8217;ve been getting into Python more recently, and I wondered if
there was some sort of static site generator, written in Python, which had good support
for github pages (which is where I decided to host my site now I&amp;#8217;ve retired my old 
cloud server I rented from digital ocean). Pelican seemed well liked, and I managed,
with the help of a lot of fairly hairy regexp conversions,
to turn my old Jekyll blog into a Pelican one. My first hit was &lt;a href="https://opensource.com/article/19/5/run-your-blog-github-pages-python"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; by Erik O&amp;#8217;Shaughnessy, who seems to be a cool dude. In fact, when you search for tutorials on Pelican, 
you&amp;#8217;ll get a bazillion hits, all of which are probably fine, but Erik&amp;#8217;s is the only one I&amp;#8217;ve read.
He focusses on using Markdown, rather than &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RST&lt;/span&gt;, which seems to be the native markdown
language for Pelican. I don&amp;#8217;t know &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RST&lt;/span&gt;: I use Markdown for a lot of stuff, 
mainly because it seems to be so widely&amp;nbsp;supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pelican is very neat, because it automates (via a makefile) the uploading of the file to github pages. It&amp;#8217;s probably me, but whenever I try to use git to do anything which isn&amp;#8217;t totally 
bog standard I feel like an idiot. Fortunately, the makefile hides all that, and works fine
in Windows&amp;nbsp;powershell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Update 7 Dec&amp;nbsp;2020&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;#8217;ve used Pelican for six months. 
I have hit a few little niggles, and I haven&amp;#8217;t moved to a different template, even though this was one of the reasons I&amp;#8217;d wanted to move to it for.
It has been better since I started using Zettlr (although I&amp;#8217;m actually editing this in Vim, a workalike of the classic unix editor &lt;em&gt;vi&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>15th April 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/15th-april-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-04-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-04-30:/15th-april-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;15th April&amp;nbsp;2020&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, last week has been pretty awful. The Fed went all in on stimulus and there was a face-ripping rally of all risk assets. You lost a lot. Ugh. Lots of stops triggered. Yesterday was also a risk-on day, and you lost money, although you did sell a few puts to offset the short positions in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RUT&lt;/span&gt;. You sold short-dated ones to get some positive theta. Today is sort of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, as of now&amp;nbsp;(3:36).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your&amp;nbsp;gains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;widespread. Most of your positions are negative&amp;nbsp;beta,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; short put. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; defies gravity. You have a calendar spread: short short-dated puts, long long-dated puts. For a large move, you&amp;#8217;ll got short, but you&amp;#8217;re trying to stay fairly delta-neutral. You are still slightly short&amp;nbsp;gamma.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;making money on the &amp;#8220;Incredible Hulks&amp;#8221; trade &amp;#8212; all these tanker companies. One of your few +ve beta&amp;nbsp;posns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you made money on your residual short &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FXI&lt;/span&gt; trade, via puts. Maybe China isn&amp;#8217;t so strong after&amp;nbsp;all. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your&amp;nbsp;losses:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GC&lt;/span&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s ugly. But you have a big posn. ($520K ). You&amp;#8217;re thinking of getting some otm&amp;nbsp;puts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your&amp;nbsp;winners:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incredible hulks looking&amp;nbsp;good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KL&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BX&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAV&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;INO&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HSBA&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RACE&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BKLN&lt;/span&gt;.

&lt;li&gt;basically, everything else. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BA&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RUT&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; stand&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/li&gt;

This was a smart move. The market has been rocketing lately, for no obvious reason, as usual. At least I haven&amp;#8217;t been damaged too&amp;nbsp;badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My big mistake was going long three contracts June &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GC&lt;/span&gt;. Gold, although it&amp;#8217;s doing well, was smashed. A hedging position, short puts, offset some of the damage, but it still accounts for my&amp;nbsp;downside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &amp;#8220;incredible hulks&amp;#8221; strategy seems not to be holed below the waterline, yet. Nothing spectacular though, as oil has been rallying, with incessant boosterism from the orange buffoon (who is, naturally, enjoying record approval&amp;nbsp;ratings).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I bought one &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESTX50&lt;/span&gt;, because &amp;#8220;if you can&amp;#8217;t beat them, join&amp;nbsp;them&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sold one &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZAR&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZAR&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TRL&lt;/span&gt;, and other weak currencies are going to get&amp;nbsp;smashed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMB&lt;/span&gt; looks a safe short &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4338000-emb-emerging-market-junk-bonds-sow-seeds-of-next-financial-crisis?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=seeking_alpha&amp;amp;mail_subject=wingcapital-investments-emb-emerging-market-junk-bonds-could-sow-the-seeds-of-the-next-financial-crisis&amp;amp;utm_campaign=rta-author-article&amp;amp;utm_content=link-0"&gt;according to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. You shorted &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMB&lt;/span&gt; a while ago, via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CFD&lt;/span&gt;, but it has done nothing so&amp;nbsp;far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GILD&lt;/span&gt; is rocketing, as there a rumour that Remdesivir, an anti-viral, is effective against Covid-19. &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3561615-exuberance-out-of-control-on-gilead-covid-baird%20"&gt;Exuberance &amp;#8216;out of control&amp;#8217; on Gilead/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;COVID&lt;/span&gt; -&amp;nbsp;Baird&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article by Karen Ward in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; saying that inflation was breaking higher. 100% of the comment disagreed, but at some point it really is going to&amp;nbsp;happen.&lt;/p&gt;

As he says, he&amp;#8217;s been very wrong in the past. It looks very illiquid. Not sure what&amp;#8217;s wrong with a contract of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt;. The thesis is simple. Oil production is going to shut, cutting off the supply which is a byproduct of oil. Demand is holding up. Prices will&amp;nbsp;rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;close&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to get delta-neutral. Sold some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BA&lt;/span&gt; puts to compensate for those expiring. Closed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GC&lt;/span&gt; short hedge posn. You had a calendar spread, but you were not convinced about it. Sold a few more hulks. This seems to be a working strategy. Sold some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RUT&lt;/span&gt; to compensate for expiry, to keep&amp;nbsp;neutral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GC&lt;/span&gt; killed you today.

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s tough to trade in this whipsawing market. Trying to reduce risk without&amp;nbsp;losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;afternoon&amp;nbsp;trades&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Closed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DHT&lt;/span&gt; (long hit limit), &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WORK&lt;/span&gt; (bought back short call), &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HG&lt;/span&gt; (stopped, but at profit), &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TLSA&lt;/span&gt;(short&amp;nbsp;C)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, it&amp;#8217;s a risk off day, which makes you feel like a genius. The reason that traders swear by having a system, is that if you don&amp;#8217;t, you get profitable days which make you feel like a genius when then leads to your blowing up. It doesn&amp;#8217;t really matter what the system is, it&amp;#8217;s just to bind you to the mask so you do not act on the siren calls of a green&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday you saw the market moving higher, rather aggressively, and you decided to hedge some of your short positions by going long &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NQ&lt;/span&gt;. This really wasn&amp;#8217;t a successful strategy. Really, you should keep your risk low enough so that you can just forget about hedging. Hedging just means that you miss out on the bounce&amp;nbsp;back.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>2020_april_20th</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/2020_april_20th.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-04-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-04-30:/2020_april_20th.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;20th April&amp;nbsp;2020&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Stops and&amp;nbsp;limits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, overnight, a few stops were triggered, with some modest downside. Your short in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DJ600&lt;/span&gt; went again. The good thing was that this has dropped your risk level a lot. Because of the insane volatility, this is a good&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Morning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closed out: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDXUSD&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DJ600&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FXI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PUTS&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MXEA&lt;/span&gt;. Mainly stops. Not too bad. Can stand a longer market&amp;nbsp;excursion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You tend to close out your winners too soon: you are looking sick on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BA&lt;/span&gt; puts &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RUT&lt;/span&gt; puts (although after a good day&amp;nbsp;yesterday).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best performance is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FXI&lt;/span&gt;. You closed out quite a chunk of this&amp;nbsp;overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You bought some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GC&lt;/span&gt; via&amp;nbsp;stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Afternoon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BX&lt;/span&gt; closed at slight&amp;nbsp;profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESTX50&lt;/span&gt; closed at loss (rising&amp;nbsp;market)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bought more &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EURN&lt;/span&gt; cfds and one &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAV&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;put.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opened a posn. in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CACC&lt;/span&gt;. Decided that the crash is going to flush out some of the naked&amp;nbsp;swimmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing for the&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, Trump tweeted out the fact that he&amp;#8217;d talked to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MBS&lt;/span&gt; on the phone to persuade &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KSA&lt;/span&gt; to restrict supply of crude. You can bet your 409(K) that his cronies all got the tip off before he tweeted. Anyway, everything shot up, but it was short lived. I made a few hundred dollars by shorting &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CL&lt;/span&gt; at the peak and then selling it as it glided down. I was one lot Larry: I don&amp;#8217;t have the capital to make big bets. It paid for my dinner. Otherwise got lucky on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LK&lt;/span&gt;. I had some modest puts on the ADRs and the stock just cratered when it was revealed that there was fraud in the co., just as Citron said there was. A few positions were closed out by the spike. I just hate Trump for being such an asshole. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BX&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESTX50&lt;/span&gt;. I bought more &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EURN&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STNG&lt;/span&gt; (because the position was stopped by the spike). Hopefully, Trump&amp;#8217;s antics will lose their effect. He can&amp;#8217;t do much about the real economy, and goosing the stockmarket is just going to push regular investors away as the decay from Trumpian spikes loses them money when they (inevitably) buy the stocks the insiders are&amp;nbsp;selling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decided to check out what Citron is short of and shorted &lt;span class="caps"&gt;INO&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FLT&lt;/span&gt;. The recent price behaviour looks&amp;nbsp;favourable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fancy shorting Fly Leasing. Based on a skim read of &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4335617-fly-leasing-is-vulnerable-to-effects-from-coronavirus?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=seeking_alpha&amp;amp;mail_subject=gold-panda-fly-leasing-is-vulnerable-to-the-effects-from-the-coronavirus&amp;amp;utm_campaign=rta-author-article&amp;amp;utm_content=link-0"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;. Not sure yet whether to plunge. It &lt;em&gt;sounds&lt;/em&gt; a good&amp;nbsp;idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4335607-global-shipping-tankers-winning-uncertainty-abounds"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SA&lt;/span&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; support&amp;#8217;s Kuppy&amp;#8217;s case for going long tankers. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPLP&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSSI&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;INSW&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LPG&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SBLK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;reccommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMAR&lt;/span&gt; seems to offer some collaborative spreadsheet solution. Doesn&amp;#8217;t sound like a long-term plan. Although &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MS&lt;/span&gt; could always buy it for silly money and destroy the&amp;nbsp;thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

This edition thinks that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt;, China, are all in big trouble. My thoughts are that the best way to monetize this is to short the currency. There is not enough liquidity in the stock market now and small changes in sentiment produce outsize swings in&amp;nbsp;prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Current state of&amp;nbsp;play&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil is very weak on a combination of demand and supply. Donald J Pump made it go up 5% on 3rd April, but surely it&amp;#8217;s trend will not be reversed. The &amp;#8220;Incredible Hulks&amp;#8221; trade should survive, but &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DJP&lt;/span&gt; has badly injured&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;April&amp;nbsp;Overview&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Current state of&amp;nbsp;play&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil is very weak on a combination of demand and supply. Donald J Pump made it go up 5% on 3rd April, but surely it&amp;#8217;s trend will not be reversed. The &amp;#8220;Incredible Hulks&amp;#8221; trade should survive, but &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DJP&lt;/span&gt; has badly injured&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Equities, certainly large cap, must be still too expensive. Idea: find the biggest buyback stocks. Without buybacks, these may be&amp;nbsp;vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big risk is that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; infinity will lift all boats. I am not sure what to do about this. Maybe buy corp. credit and short stocks. But if bond issuers can raise capital at (likely) negative rates, won&amp;#8217;t that support their share&amp;nbsp;prices?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest beneficiary of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; inf. will be govt. bonds. I find it very hard to buy a ten-year at 0.6% but I guess if the yield goes negative I&amp;#8217;ll make money. As always, knowing what will happen to inflation is the key to profits, and as usual I don&amp;#8217;t have a clue about what will&amp;nbsp;happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another tack is to buy low quality stuff, like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MBS&lt;/span&gt; ETFs and companies suspected of fraud. Although the authorities never unveil the fraud, sometimes funding stress does. Obviously, your shorting of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;, which is a prime example of a fraud, has not gone so well even&amp;nbsp;lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Insurance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurance companies rely on returns on their float to cover the cost of their claims. Deaths will be up a bit (maybe overall down though, because of less pollution and less general infection). Negative risk-free yields and defaults on corporate debt will increase liabilities, and reduce assets: not a good combo. The other problem is companies who liabilities which are defined benefit pensions. This will mainly be municipals, but also some paternalistic&amp;nbsp;employers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When Markets are due for a&amp;nbsp;correction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how over valued or insane valuations are, even that arbitrage opportunities exist, it&amp;#8217;s still foolish to trade on the basis that the market will suddenly wake up to your view before drifting a long way further along the path that it had previously been&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets are self-fulfilling&amp;nbsp;prophesies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Perma Bear or Perma&amp;nbsp;Bull?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://valuestockgeek.com/2020/04/12/what-the-perma-bulls-and-perma-bears-get-wrong/"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is a fantastically balanced piece by Value Stock Geek. He says&amp;nbsp;that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;being ideological is a barrier to being a successful&amp;nbsp;investor,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Fed is not the author of all our misfortune, nor is it the omnipotent wizard that can stop all&amp;nbsp;recessions,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the markets are not as rational as Eugene Fama would like them to be but they are also not as irrational as the ideologues&amp;nbsp;think,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that, actually, it is best to avoid overreacting to any market&amp;nbsp;moves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some good links to videos from Peter Lynch and Milton Friedman. There is quite a good link to an old Onion piece making fun of the money&amp;nbsp;illusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The worst stocks will likely have the biggest&amp;nbsp;recoveries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very important principle. Often, a big turnover company with poor margins will be pushed into loss by a bad economy. When the economy bounces back, even a bit, the eps can roar back (even though earnings yield is still pretty crap). You also have a momentum thing, and a liquidity thing. Basically, something illiquid and high beta should not be shorted, no matter how much a basket case it seems. Except in tiny&amp;nbsp;size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gold&amp;nbsp;nervousness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold a few &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MU&lt;/span&gt;. Noticed that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GC&lt;/span&gt; was damaging my bottom line and decided to reduce my exposure by writing some calls. It&amp;#8217;s complicated because I have a stop at the strike price. Prob. better cancel the&amp;nbsp;stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Nobody Knows&amp;nbsp;Anything&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound words of advice Josh Brown on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNBC&lt;/span&gt; said as he and Brad Gerstner of Altimeter Capital discussed the markets, (and I&amp;nbsp;paraphrase):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person you want to run away from now is the person who &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KNOWS&lt;/span&gt; what will&amp;nbsp;happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just before that Adam and I were chatting and shared these simple&amp;nbsp;thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound words of advice The fact is we are grasping at straws and hoping. In fact, the first words I typed today&amp;nbsp;were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBP&lt;/span&gt; is the strongest and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; is the weakest as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NA&lt;/span&gt; traders enter for the day as stocks (and yields) move back higher on hope. Hope for a stimulus package passage, hope that the Fed&amp;#8217;s stimulus helps the economy, hope that the virus does not get too outta hand, and hope that the deficits being built will one day ease. Yes&amp;#8230; &amp;#8220;Hope&amp;#8221; is part of trading. No one &amp;#8220;knows&amp;#8221; for sure, or even close to &amp;#8220;knows&amp;#8221;, what will happen - especially now. We will, and should have a &amp;#8220;hard time&amp;nbsp;believing&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when the dust settles, there will be those that &amp;#8220;knew all along&amp;#8221;. Fine. Have your day on twitter or in a comment. However, if you did not include a level of risk&amp;#8230;you are just flipping a coin in my&amp;nbsp;eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, I would rather remain humble and listen to those that are humble who understand where they are&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will also base my thoughts on what I see in the charts, because it tells a story to me. That story has included in it, a lot of &amp;#8220;IFs&amp;#8221;. In fact, in a post earlier today titled &amp;#8220;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USDJPY&lt;/span&gt; remains in the middle of the 3 day range. Buyers keep more of the bias&amp;#8221;, I&amp;nbsp;wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intraday, the price action is up and down today. The lows have stalled along a trend line. The price is trading around the 50% of the move down from yesterday&amp;#8217;s highs at 110.828. The price is above the 100 and 200 bar MAs at 110.543 and 110.63 currently. The price has been able to stay above the 200 bar &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MA&lt;/span&gt; since breaking about an hour or so ago. If the price can stay above the 200 bar &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MA&lt;/span&gt; (green line), that keeps the buyers in control intraday. Move below the 200 and 100 bar &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MA&lt;/span&gt; (blue line) and the intraday sellers are back in firm control. The last two sentences are my way of saying &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t know&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;I hope&amp;#8221;. However, the &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IF&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; is my way of also saying &amp;#8220;That is my stop area. Things are good as long as that condition remains&amp;nbsp;true.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people don&amp;#8217;t like that. Some people are not like that. They feel that you have to have a &amp;#8220;conviction&amp;#8221;. &amp;#8220;Buy&amp;#8230;. it is going up&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;Stop with all the&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;IFs.&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My response is &amp;#8220;What makes me know more than &amp;#8220;the market&amp;#8221;? What makes my crystal ball so much clearer than all the others out there?&amp;#8221; Don&amp;#8217;t be&amp;nbsp;silly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I know is what I see. If I see it in the chart, my feeling is others from all around the world can see it too. In fact I try to make it simple to all (or those that read my posts). I post what I see (post the chart(s)). I comment on what I see with arrows and words, but do &amp;#8220;I know for sure?&amp;#8221; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOPE&lt;/span&gt;! It is contingent on the &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IF&lt;/span&gt; the price stays above the&amp;#8230;..blah, blah,&amp;nbsp;blah&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is traders, if you &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KNOW&lt;/span&gt; what will happen, run away from yourself. Instead, find where the &amp;#8220;IFs&amp;#8221; are that will tell you where you are wrong, and you will have the right mindset for&amp;nbsp;trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Stanley Druckenmiller complains, you know it&amp;#8217;s tough. He&amp;#8217;s a billionaire and undoubtedly one of the greatest traders of all&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He laments how algos and quants have changed the&amp;nbsp;game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;I made 30 percent a year for 30 years. Now, we aren&amp;#8217;t even in the same zip code, much less the same state,&amp;#8221; he&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be easy to dismiss him as a has-been but he&amp;#8217;s not just complaining, he outlines how markets have&amp;nbsp;changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;You&amp;#8217;re getting noise that used to mean something, and now it doesn&amp;#8217;t mean anything,&amp;#8221; he&amp;nbsp;says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volatility used to be something that traders and active fund managers loved. It was seen as an opportunity but not any&amp;nbsp;longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Volatility is only good if it&amp;#8217;s part of the trend and it&amp;#8217;s giving you entry points within a trend,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;When you&amp;#8217;re going up and down, but there&amp;#8217;s no real trend, that&amp;#8217;s a nightmare. You might think that a volatility move is the beginning of a trend and get yourself&amp;nbsp;whipsawed.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, that&amp;#8217;s the lay of the land now. People will always find ways to make money and today is no&amp;nbsp;different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Druckenmiller highlights the things that will always be key, including curiosity, open-mindedness and&amp;nbsp;courage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve never made a buy at a low that I didn&amp;#8217;t just feel terrible and scared to death making it,&amp;#8221; he&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Friday 3rd April 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/friday-3rd-april-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-04-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-04-30:/friday-3rd-april-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Friday 3rd April&amp;nbsp;2020&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Morning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sold to open: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt;, Z, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DJ600&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RR&lt;/span&gt;. Bearish. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt; was yesterday, but&amp;nbsp;late.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Closed: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SX7P&lt;/span&gt; fut. No longer hedging very modest put&amp;nbsp;posn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summary: transferred £xxxk to fund mortgage, so now maint. margin is ~50% of equity, so quite high risk. Stops on everything. Biggest posns. still &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RUT&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; is high risk: deliveries announced yesterday. No great pop, but Musk still appearing to show good production and&amp;nbsp;sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked a question of Bill Fleckenstein about which bonds are best to short in the time of Covid-induced inflation. We&amp;#8217;ll see if he&amp;nbsp;answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Afternoon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got a bit more confident in the afternoon as markets continued to&amp;nbsp;sag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDS&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BKNG&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VNQ&lt;/span&gt; and added to short positions in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DAX&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SC&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CACC&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TLSA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was a good day, after being quite badly down earlier. Biggest contributions to profit were &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RUT&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CACC&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MHI&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XLF&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTMIB&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GC&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZAR&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FXI&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SC&lt;/span&gt; (and good contribs from my smaller short positions in crappy stuff like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALLY&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losses from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TLSA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STNG&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BA&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; up on the usual fraud, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BA&lt;/span&gt; on hopes of a bailout. I could still come very unstuck on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BA&lt;/span&gt;, but I hope that they won&amp;#8217;t have the nerve to make the stockholders&amp;nbsp;whole.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Incredible Hulks</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/incredible-hulks.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-04-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-04-30:/incredible-hulks.html</id><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;23rd April&amp;nbsp;2020&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You tried to reduce your margin. Big use is a massive hedged short put in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SBUX&lt;/span&gt;.

&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BA&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; dragging you down.
You are long one &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt;, but maybe not enough.
You think you bought this via a trailing stop.
Trying to unwind the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GC&lt;/span&gt; call spread. 
Although it&amp;#8217;s limited risk, you are going off gold.
My &lt;a href="https://www.koyfin.com/myd/5e860e55f05193d872ab038b"&gt;Overhyped Stocks&lt;/a&gt; list is doing well, but at some point it will&amp;nbsp;fade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I heard that crude had soared 40% after Donny had tweeted that he was going to fire at Iranian shipping with gunboats. I thought I was toast.
In fact, it wasn&amp;#8217;t too bad. I was short the Dec. fut, which moved 9%. I doubled&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did get hit by a ludicrous short put position in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SBUX&lt;/span&gt;. 
I had got it hedged, but a 6% move in the underlying completely derailed it.
Big negative portfolio gamma hurt me. I took out the position after discovering that I was (for some unknown reason) long &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SBUX&lt;/span&gt;. I am an&amp;nbsp;idiot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did buy some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt; on a trailing buy. Closed&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, a bit sick, but up over the last two days in aggregate, 
and closing the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SBUX&lt;/span&gt;  cut my margin requirement by&amp;nbsp;$100K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I increased my exposure to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GC&lt;/span&gt;. It seems to be&amp;nbsp;moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went short 1 lot &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZN&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sold some calls against my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EURN&lt;/span&gt; and went deeper long &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FRO&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Oil goes to negative price!</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/oil-goes-to-negative-price.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-04-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:14:11+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-04-30:/oil-goes-to-negative-price.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;21 April&amp;nbsp;2020&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;li&gt;bought &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NG&lt;/span&gt;, couple of&amp;nbsp;lots&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Sold a very long-dated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESTX50&lt;/span&gt; call. I have been burned too much on negative theta positions, and I like to earn a bit of premium while I wait for markets to&amp;nbsp;break.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the opening and closing trades, it&amp;#8217;s not at all what I was trying to do. About half the trades were auto close outs. I seem to have taken on more risk, drunk on large profits largely generated from my high gamma &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RUT&lt;/span&gt; puts. Although I was up a lot, I did not remotely look like a disciplined trader. A number of the single name puts were based on a gut instinct that stock which had not yet fallen very much were doomed to go down. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VZ&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPB&lt;/span&gt; fall into this category. I really know nothing about these names, and I may regret taking the&amp;nbsp;position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump came on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; to reassure the population. Flights from Schengen were banned. The Fed said it would launch a $1.5B repo facility (bigger than the annual &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; defence budget!!). There seems to be a building consensus that the authorities are going to close the&amp;nbsp;markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got a bit carried away with profits yesterday and decided to increase exposure at time of maximum panic. The authorities are promising stimulus packages today. Yesterday central banks underwhelmed, particularly Lagarde, who is out of ammunition, and generally disliked by most people, I think it&amp;#8217;s fair to&amp;nbsp;say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Result was a lurch down as most markets rocketed. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTMIB&lt;/span&gt; up 14%. Must be an all time&amp;nbsp;record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record, and sounding like a broken record, I am still&amp;nbsp;bearish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Afternoon&amp;nbsp;trades&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some bargains for the bearish which I failed to&amp;nbsp;resist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;14:55: bought some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MU&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;puts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;14:56: sold Russian equities (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDXUSD&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;fut)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;14:56: bought a few more &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; 200 puts, now out at Oct&amp;nbsp;expiry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;14:56: bought a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EWA&lt;/span&gt; (Aussie etf)&amp;nbsp;put.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bit lazy. Not sure all these executed. Market coming back in my direction, but I&amp;#8217;m still down&amp;nbsp;heavily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your margin exposure is very high, especially going into the weekend. Generally, at the end of the week traders unwind or lay off their positions. Having just written this, I put in an order to buy another &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RUT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OCT&lt;/span&gt; put, with a delta of 0.22. The Russell has been good to me, and I am predisposed to put more money on it coming good again. Totally irrationally, I&amp;nbsp;realize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying again to get some exposure to gold, but it just can&amp;#8217;t hold its price. I simply do not understand why promises of stimulus should be toxic for gold, but I guess it&amp;#8217;s because gold is still seen as a non-yielding&amp;nbsp;asset.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>14th March 2020 \(Saturday\) March 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/14th-march-2020-saturday-march-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:42:46+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-03-30:/14th-march-2020-saturday-march-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;No trading today (obviously).

Ridiculous ramp by Donny yesterday evening, announcing huge stimulus package. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FED&lt;/span&gt; has restarted &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; and has pumped unprecented quantities of cash into the banks via repo madness. There seems to be some evidence that the virus is fully under control in China. In Europe, the rate of growth is not as bad as anticipated, and the overall death rate is modest. Gold and gold miners have taken a beating. Bitcoin has been slammed. Amazingly, bonds, especially Bunds, have&amp;nbsp;stumbled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not sure what to do. I have a modest short position, but it may be that stonks will continue to rally. I strongly believe that they are still very much overvalued, but I now know that the market doesn&amp;#8217;t care a damn about what I&amp;nbsp;feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the tape today, my ideas for the open&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;short &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VNQ&lt;/span&gt;: REITs haven&amp;#8217;t gone down enough, and interest rates could actually be on the&amp;nbsp;rise,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;short&amp;nbsp;Bunds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keep an eye on the dollar. The Dollar Milkshake Theory is still holding, but rates in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; have gone to zero (or soon&amp;nbsp;will),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which implies to me that some of the carry trades will reverse. There is an article on this in this week&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;Economist,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but I found it hard to follow the arguement (or, at least, to draw clear trading implications from&amp;nbsp;it),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;look at shorting a few auto manufacturers, which have bounced a lot at the close last&amp;nbsp;week.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All sales, all&amp;nbsp;futures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Options markets now getting very illiquid. No quotes in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OOM&lt;/span&gt; puts in most things including &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SX7P&lt;/span&gt;, the Euro banks&amp;nbsp;index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bought a 3000 strike gold option, a year out. $400 premium. 20% &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IV&lt;/span&gt;. Well, placed the&amp;nbsp;order!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trade&amp;nbsp;(11:25):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTP&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pushes margin req&amp;#8217;mt to&amp;nbsp;$436K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;12:23&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this game, one learns all about liquidity and opportunity costs. Now find that there are no out of the money puts to be bought for love nor money. Thank goodness I bought some on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;. I now feel so confident about making money on this stock &amp;#8230; well, by shorting it, anyhow. This is probably the time to wind down my position. The twin emotions of fear and greed facing me at this juncture, as&amp;nbsp;always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12:54 sold &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HG&lt;/span&gt;. 1&amp;nbsp;Fut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;18:15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolute mass of closeouts and&amp;nbsp;trades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Closes:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big wins: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; puts, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HYG&lt;/span&gt; puts, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMB&lt;/span&gt; puts, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EWT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;puts,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stops: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESTX50&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UB&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OPENS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, a list of futures, and shorting &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UB&lt;/span&gt;. Bought some more further out of the money&amp;nbsp;puts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now very difficult to buy out of the money puts on single name &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; stocks, country ETFs and euro sector&amp;nbsp;indices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels as though the market is gradually losing liquidity. Presumably, all the margin calls are in and there fewer and fewer forced&amp;nbsp;sellers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good thing is that the hitting of limit orders on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RUT&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; puts has dramatically reduced the margin req., down from ~$435K to now $358K. I did buy some more puts with the extra &amp;#8220;buying power&amp;#8221; generated but at some point the market is possibly going to spring back. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; has lost around one third of its value from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATH&lt;/span&gt; a month&amp;nbsp;ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;19:19&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decided to buy some puts on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LQD&lt;/span&gt; - investment grade &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt;. Bonds are the next frontier. Govt. bonds still going up, high yield down. Where will high quality corp. credit go? Down, I&amp;#8217;m guessing.&amp;nbsp;Obviously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wrap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finished the day something like $280K up. A great day! This is the point of maximum danger. My good luck is lulling me into the delusion that I have perfect foresight. This will make me take more risks which will end up with me losing everything. God give me strength to resist temptation and not stray from the path of righteousness and tight risk&amp;nbsp;controls.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>17th March, 2020 \(Tuesday\) March 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/17th-march-2020-tuesday-march-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:42:46+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-03-30:/17th-march-2020-tuesday-march-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Starting to be fearful of any continued (short) equity exposure.

At some point they will bounce. Still short, and with loose stops because intra day fluctuations are large. Covid-19 is a severe headwind for the global economy. The big worry now is that markets will be closed and the authorities will bring out the fiscal bazookas (or howitzers) just at a time where I am locked into unfavourable&amp;nbsp;positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recognition of the risks of fiscal action, I started to short some govvies. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBL&lt;/span&gt; and R. Not large&amp;nbsp;positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 10:35 equities are&amp;nbsp;down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DJ600&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BY&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;2.5%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;es&amp;nbsp;0.75%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTMIB&lt;/span&gt; by&amp;nbsp;5.66%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HSI&lt;/span&gt; by&amp;nbsp;2.4%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDXUSD&lt;/span&gt; by&amp;nbsp;4.3%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SX7P&lt;/span&gt; by&amp;nbsp;3.5%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TOPX&lt;/span&gt; by&amp;nbsp;1.7%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Actually, these were noted a while ago. There has been a bit of a bounce in the last half hour which cut your gains in half. Currently, you are up 0.8%: effectively a rounding error in today&amp;#8217;s stormy&amp;nbsp;weather.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;11:07&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decided to put on a number of stop and limit orders to scale back risk in the face of further volatility. Generally, the futures had stop orders, the larger option positions had limit orders. Generally, the limit orders will show a healthy profit. The stops should contain the positions to modest losses. These were all trailing stops, so if the positions make further profits, these should be locked&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;14:33&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets are skittish today. At around 13:45,&amp;nbsp;which&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;16:32&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bought 10x &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt;! Have been seeing something about how &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; is in high demand as people try to refinance their debt. Slightly spur of the moment. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; has been strong. Finally acted on the dollar milkshake&amp;nbsp;theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UBER&lt;/span&gt; shorts, to reduce&amp;nbsp;exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt; stopped, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTP&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TOPX&lt;/span&gt; all triggered stops. Brutal upswing in equities, now showing $82K loss. In a classic example of making trading decisions according to frame of mind, rather than a system, I&amp;#8217;d been reading some dire article on disease spread modelling by Neil Ferguson and others. Lots of things are closing down. Seems like the end of the&amp;nbsp;world!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ve made some money, but it seems clear that you are trading too much. Test now is to see if you can leave &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TWS&lt;/span&gt; well alone until tomorrow. One bright spot is that your short bond positions are looking healthy: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBL&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UB&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;16:50&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That didn&amp;#8217;t last long. Sold some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LQD&lt;/span&gt; cfds and bought some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XLF&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;puts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;17:15&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On down days, the temptation to change one&amp;#8217;s mind is almost irresistible. It&amp;#8217;s like Odysseus stopping up his men&amp;#8217;s ears with wax and being bound to the mast of the ship. The Market Wizards interviews all have traders going on about how important it is to stick to &amp;#8216;a&amp;#8217; system, almost irrespective of exactly what system. I guess the greatest sin is to change horses in&amp;nbsp;mid-race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;18:21&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt; puts stopped out. In profit, but I think &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt; has further to go&amp;nbsp;down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;early eve&amp;nbsp;(maybe)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sold &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESTX50&lt;/span&gt; via&amp;nbsp;stop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;at the&amp;nbsp;close&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets were very, very volatile today. You were down a lot, and a lot of short positions closed by stop. However, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt; closed down by 4.5% (maybe), so it looks as though the bear is still in the ascendant and that today (and yesterday) really was a bear market rally. Of course nothing is certain, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IB&lt;/span&gt; has now really cranked up margin requirements on open positions, which means that even though my shorts look modest my maintenance margin amount looks&amp;nbsp;humongous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point there are going to be some very great bargains to be had, but maybe not yet, and maybe not for another quarter or&amp;nbsp;two.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>23rd March 2020 \(Monday\) March 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/23rd-march-2020-monday-march-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:42:47+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-03-30:/23rd-march-2020-monday-march-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Usual drill: checked Twitter and tried to get a feel for the open.

&lt;p&gt;You hedged your positions with 5 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MXEA&lt;/span&gt; futures. This was showing a hefty loss, although you were net up, so you sold&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decided to hedge out the &amp;#8216;commodity element&amp;#8217; of gold by taking an equal nominal short position in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HG&lt;/span&gt; (long &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GC&lt;/span&gt;/short 3 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HG&lt;/span&gt;).

&lt;p&gt;All the above via limit orders (I&amp;nbsp;think!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing&amp;nbsp;Comments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had too many trades triggered via limit orders. The market was moving my way and my portfolio looked too messy and my exposure was too high. Luckily, the market continued to trend and I was able to exit and take&amp;nbsp;profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closing trades: sell &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTMIB&lt;/span&gt;, buy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HYG&lt;/span&gt; Apr17&amp;#8216;20 87 call, sell &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UBER&lt;/span&gt; Jun19&amp;#8216;20 21 put, sell &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MGM&lt;/span&gt; mAR 27&amp;#8216;20 16.5 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PUT&lt;/span&gt;, buy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MXEA&lt;/span&gt; Fut, buy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RUR&lt;/span&gt; Fut, sell &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFLX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOV&lt;/span&gt; 20&amp;#8216;20 220 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PUT&lt;/span&gt;, sell &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROKU&lt;/span&gt; jAN 15&amp;#8216;21 55 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PUT&lt;/span&gt;, sell &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LVS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JUN&lt;/span&gt; 19&amp;#8216;20 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PUT&lt;/span&gt;, buy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FUT&lt;/span&gt;, buy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FUT&lt;/span&gt;, buy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SHOP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOV&lt;/span&gt; 20&amp;#8216;20 780 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CALL&lt;/span&gt;, sell &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JUL&lt;/span&gt; 17&amp;#8216;20 310 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PUT&lt;/span&gt;, buy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CLX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OCT16&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8216;20 180 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CALL&lt;/span&gt;, sell &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TLT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JAN&lt;/span&gt; 21&amp;#8216;22 120 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PUT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opening trades: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; Sep18&amp;#8216;20 200 puts (adding to big position), &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RUT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OCT&lt;/span&gt; 15&amp;#8216;20 900 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PUT&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UBER&lt;/span&gt; (not sure why I did this, probably to reduce my theta and hedge&amp;nbsp;my&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gold still not going up. Currencies not a clear trend: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; is now going up, after a lurch down from 20&amp;nbsp;Feb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long term interest rates still going down, but at some point the 40 year bull market in bonds is going to break. My main concern is to maintain my trading capital to take advantage of this. This will probably correspond to gold moving, but it&amp;#8217;s hard to say. The bonfire is built, but we&amp;#8217;re still looking for matches and maybe the wood is still too&amp;nbsp;damp.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Monday 9th March 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/monday-9th-march-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:42:47+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-03-30:/monday-9th-march-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Chaos overnight: Saudi declared war on Russia and pushed crude prices down to&amp;nbsp;$32&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, had instinctive feeling that today was going down. Racheted up my exposure to $327.9K margin.&amp;nbsp;Scary!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mondays are odd, because the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; markets don&amp;#8217;t get going until the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; morning, so there are no live prices for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt; in the morning. Your exposure to the far east via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; derivatives (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FXI&lt;/span&gt; puts) is considerable. This is likely to be a huge day for you. The question now is how to avoid getting crushed by the bounce. You have to unwind, but what do you&amp;nbsp;trade??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most amazing thing about the markets is that no new information has appeared in the last week or two. Coronavirus was known about in January. The overvaluation of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; markets was known then. The likelihood that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; interest rates would go to zero (like in Europe and Japan) was predicted months and months ago. The weak growth of the world economy (especially the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; economy, whose notional real &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; growth was boosted by dubious hedonic adjustments to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; deflator). None of this really mattered until a dislocation in the market forced participants (now, probably, algorithms channeling human actors) to see the world from a different&amp;nbsp;perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;After&amp;nbsp;lunch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No point in trying to list sales. Basically, you unwound some of your exposure through straight short futures positions in Australia, Japan, Europe. After an initial phase in which circuit breakers halted trading, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt; market started to rise. You actually bought one &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point you were up 20%, $197K. You could not realise this, no bids or offers in many long dated options&amp;nbsp;positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning&amp;#8217;s (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; time) action will condition the algos not to but the dip so enthusiastically in future. Whether I can replicate this performance again this month is debatable. Hopefully, the bull will be slain and we&amp;#8217;ll grind down for the rest of the year. Margin back to ~$250K in &amp;gt;$1M. You still have a lot to make&amp;nbsp;back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3:30pm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market recovering a bit. Bought a couple of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt;, to blunt the&amp;nbsp;impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got short (via puts, looking for liquid ones) for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MM&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VZ&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SBUX&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BA&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VZ&lt;/span&gt; because it seemed to have held up so&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson: good and bad stocks will be pulled down together because so much trading is via&amp;nbsp;ETFs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most extreme days in the market in recent history. Saudi, coronavirus, waking up. You were up 20%, which is good, but with many equities markets moving 7% this was not as good as it might have been. You kept your risk under control, and maintained your stops, so you were definitely more disciplined than you have been in the&amp;nbsp;past.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Thurs 19th March 2020 March 2020</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/thurs-19th-march-2020-march-2020.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:42:47+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2020-03-30:/thurs-19th-march-2020-march-2020.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;End of day&amp;nbsp;stops&lt;/h2&gt;

Not clear in which direction. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPM&lt;/span&gt; put out dire predictions of Depression scale collapse in demand, but mind boggling sums being printed by the Fed are being announced every day. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UB&lt;/span&gt; seems risk (vs 10 year) but my view is that these programmes are easy to start and hard to stop so in the long run we are (surely) going to see inflation win the tug of&amp;nbsp;war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; has no clear direction after sudden bounce. I have heard various commentators making the point that there is a scramble for dollars, but I do not entirely see how this translates into a stronger dollar. The Fed is creating a tsunami of dollars, and has unlimited power to create more so how can the strength continue? Anyway, for the moment, I&amp;#8217;m holding on for dear&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SX7P&lt;/span&gt;, Euro Banks Index, has steadied. I am a long term bear, but I can see that the announcements of CBs everywhere will support the banks. My only positions now are through options, with no stops, so I am in for the long(ish) term. Most of my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SX7P&lt;/span&gt; options are 92 days&amp;nbsp;maturity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, it may be that we&amp;#8217;ve hit a support level, if not absolute bottom, in equities and I should let stops and the positive gamma of my long options positions naturally scale back my short equity position. Maint. margin now is a scary $0.75M, even after the overnight stops. I must not extend any of my short positions, no matter how tempted I&amp;nbsp;am!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sold 1 Fut, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZAR&lt;/span&gt;. Emerging markets are going to be hammered when the developed world goes into&amp;nbsp;recession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12:01: short &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZN&lt;/span&gt; fut position closed, as recession worries push down long rates. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UB&lt;/span&gt; is rallying strongly, but stops not triggered. Short govt. bond futures should be negatively correlated with short equity positions, but in these extreme situations, all correlations go to&amp;nbsp;+1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12:09: well, I held off ramping up until now. I just sold 1 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIY&lt;/span&gt; fut, which is pretty chunky. Can&amp;#8217;t see equities rallying much today. Total maintenance margin is now&amp;nbsp;$745K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14:11: Fraud boy, fElon Musk is up to his tricks again. He has promised to build ventilators for the coronavirus outbreak and the algos have pumped the stock. I am eternally amazed at his ability to do this time and time again, even though he &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; delivers. I was so angered by this I bought 5 more oom puts. The stock is up something like 13%. Dumb&amp;nbsp;algos!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15:14: you dropped by about 1.5%. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UB&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; biggest contributions. Oddly, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt; is down while &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; is&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15:26: Closed the trading app. Losses fluctuating, market directionless, rumours abounding.

&lt;p&gt;As of&amp;nbsp;09:15:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bought 1 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; by accident. Was trying put on a stop, but didn&amp;#8217;t change it from the default order type of limit, so it executed immediately. At least at market price. Worried that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; will be &amp;#8216;unexpectedly&amp;#8217; resilient because the Fed still keeps monetary policy too tight, relative to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTP&lt;/span&gt; bought, stop&amp;nbsp;triggered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPI&lt;/span&gt; sold, price action, China&amp;nbsp;exposure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SX7P&lt;/span&gt;, extended position. Thesis is that as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; rates go down, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECB&lt;/span&gt; be forced to go more negative, which has bad impact on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; banks, which are already pretty&amp;nbsp;weak,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UB&lt;/span&gt; fut. sold. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UB&lt;/span&gt; spiked really, really high yesterday (&amp;gt;240!) so this is a punt on the Fed triggering proper inflation. Don&amp;#8217;t know what this price is as a yield, but has to be way less than&amp;nbsp;2%!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DAX&lt;/span&gt; sold, stop&amp;nbsp;triggered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DX&lt;/span&gt; stopped out&amp;nbsp;(earlier)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GE&lt;/span&gt; future (Eurodollar, not equity)) bought. Price is scarily high, but this is a direct bet on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; rates going to&amp;nbsp;zero.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10:21: (I wrote and installed a python macro to insert a timestamp in Notepad++.&amp;nbsp;Yay!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10:22: losses shrink to 0.3% so I&amp;#8217;m leaving off any trades for&amp;nbsp;now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10:29: P&amp;amp;L goes green. You sell another &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UB&lt;/span&gt; and R future. Market is expecting stimulus. You are now using $30K of margin on your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UB&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;11:00: decided to sell &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTP&lt;/span&gt;. It has jumped a lot. Italy is still a mess. I am now up&amp;nbsp;1%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;17:31: wild ride in afternoon. Initially showed losses of $91K: about 10%. This went right down to $20K. It then shot up again. Stocks bounced a long way back from their lows yesterday. Probably I should have closed all positions, but I am sure we have not finished with the drop. Anyhow, nothing much I can do now apart from hold on until tomorrow. I am still up a lot over 2 days but it shows how much really violent moves can bounce the next&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;closed the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIR&lt;/span&gt; puts. I am still bearish on aeroplane makers, but the market is turning&amp;nbsp;(maybe),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;closed 9434 short &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CFD&lt;/span&gt; (Softbank) out at a decent&amp;nbsp;profit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#8217;d really like to have done is go short on We Work, but that&amp;#8217;s sadly not possible as the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IPO&lt;/span&gt; never&amp;nbsp;happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bought &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESTX50&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NQ&lt;/span&gt;. The idea was to go delta neutral (in a rough and ready way), offsetting my short options in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RUT&lt;/span&gt; and various individual stocks. We shall&amp;nbsp;see. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bought &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EURN&lt;/span&gt; on the exchange &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BE&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Belgium?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;put stops on absolutely everything, apart from a few puts where I put limit orders to close. The risk is a bit high and I want any violent moves to not do too much damage. The limit orders on the two &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SX7P&lt;/span&gt; put positions (different strikes) were filled, although I hedged with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SX7P&lt;/span&gt; futures, which are now&amp;nbsp;unbalanced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; open was pretty grim. Everything moved the wrong way. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; up, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RUT&lt;/span&gt; up, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ES&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NQ&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESTX50&lt;/span&gt; hardly at all. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HG&lt;/span&gt; up, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GC&lt;/span&gt; down, so particularly bad for your position, which wanted to exploit the (+ve)&amp;nbsp;correlation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There didn&amp;#8217;t seem any point in taking action to fix this because with any luck it will all reverse tomorrow.

You sold &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTP&lt;/span&gt; too, which seems a &amp;#8216;safe&amp;#8217; bet&amp;nbsp;(haha!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TWS&lt;/span&gt; warnings about orders on near-term futures so you rolled over all futures to next month. Affected: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DJ600&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTMIB&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NQ&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDXUSD&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later your profits zoomed up to $100K. Markets retraced, causing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBL&lt;/span&gt; and R to be stopped out. I am not sure what market will be most affected by inflation, but maybe &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBL&lt;/span&gt; is not the one, because Germany has such a strong balance sheet, and maybe not R because the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; has such a weak currency that maybe it will strengthen, squeching inflation. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TBH&lt;/span&gt;, I&amp;#8217;m grasping at straws, but inflation is going to pop up&amp;nbsp;somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;11:40&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DJ600&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTMIB&lt;/span&gt; stopped out. Slight&amp;nbsp;loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;15:03&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; open was intersting. Stocks and bonds continue to&amp;nbsp;fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stopped out: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NQ&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JNK&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIO&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VCLT&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTP&lt;/span&gt;. All bar the last at a profit. Trailing stops are working for you, even though you are typically putting a 2-3% range on&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purchased more puts on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MU&lt;/span&gt;. Both continue to&amp;nbsp;sag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GLRE&lt;/span&gt; closed out at a slight loss. Presumably worries about claims wipe out attractiveness of the fund&amp;nbsp;management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15:06: you are now up 11%. You have $1.1M &amp;#8216;excess liquidity&amp;#8217; but that&amp;#8217;s still pretty dangerous at only 2x maintenance&amp;nbsp;margin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;15:39&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bought a bit of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AEM&lt;/span&gt; (gold miner), &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AAPL&lt;/span&gt; puts (too expensive), &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTP&lt;/span&gt; stopped out at a painful loss. Currently up 12.8%. Stimulus Phase 3 bill (billions for everyone) not having the desired pumping&amp;nbsp;effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are now running with a margin requirement of $600K. This is 2.5 times what it was a few weeks ago. You need to scale it back, even with your stops. It&amp;#8217;s very hard to cut back positions when seeing daily returns of 12% though. Fear and greed, bears and bulls fight out for&amp;nbsp;supremacy.&lt;/p&gt;

Same for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTMIB&lt;/span&gt;: can&amp;#8217;t get this right. Every other stock index future is&amp;nbsp;crashing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of wanting to pare back risk, in fact greed got the better of me and I increased risk in the&amp;nbsp;following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like Bill Fleckenstein, because he makes a clear distinction between what he sees as the market over valuing or undervaluing an asset and what events might prompt him to actually establish a position. He is an active trader, and runs a fund, so it&amp;#8217;s always necessary to take account of the fact that he has a strong incentive to &amp;#8220;talk his book&amp;#8221; — i.e. argue the case for buying what he holds, so the price will go&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more of a problem on major &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; platforms He makes his &amp;#8220;Rap&amp;#8221; available to the public after 1 year. He&amp;#8217;s been writing a daily market commentary for as long as you&amp;#8217;ve been&amp;nbsp;alive!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;re. fiat currency, I don&amp;#8217;t feel that it&amp;#8217;s a problem in itself as such but I think there is a problem where governments see creating money as the answer to all&amp;nbsp;problems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as it says on the masthead of Fleck&amp;#8217;s website, &amp;#8216;In a social democracy with a fiat currency, all roads lead to inflation. &amp;#8216; but actually, we&amp;#8217;ve seen very little inflation in the developed world since the 80&amp;#8217;s although there is a huge controversy over what the real rate of inflation actually is or even how we measure&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 70&amp;#8217;s, increases in the money supply translated into increases in the prices of consumables. in the 90s and naughties they translated into increases in the price of assets, especially tradeable securities. supposedly this is due to the Cantillion Effect: as money flows from banks, it inflates the price of the first thing that it&amp;#8217;s spent&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Stockman has written about this, but he is so prolix and rambling that I can&amp;#8217;t really recommend any of his books. Henry RichYesterday at 12:14 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt; For me, it&amp;#8217;s the biggest issue of all: why has all the money that the central banks have created resulted in more inflation? More precisely, when will the inflation (in consumer prices) start to be&amp;nbsp;felt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this happens, the central banks will lose control, because they will see long bond yields rising. the answer is, in a nutshell, when the output gap has closed: when the economy has no more spare capacity and when increasing demand just pushes prices&amp;nbsp;higher&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various factors, especially globalization, have contributed to delaying the point when this happens. when it does, gold will take&amp;nbsp;off&lt;/p&gt;

The club’s Steve Kilford said: “Royston Bowls Club would like to thank the council for awarding us a grant of £1,000, this will go some way towards the purchase of a de-thatching machine.”
Royston Historical Pageant was awarded a grant of £500 to assist with the costs of putting on a large historical event on Therfield Heath in July 2019.
The funding will be used to assist with publicity and advertising costs and to pay for re-enactment groups to attend.
Councillor Sarah Dingley, pageant co-ordinator, said: “Grateful thanks to the Royston Area Committee for the grant awarded to Royston Historical Pageant.
“It will help us to create a memorable event for the whole community.”
And finally, the Royston Choral Society was awarded a grant of £750 to assist with the costs of putting on a community concert. The funding will go towards the publicity and equipment hire for their performance of Bach’s St John Passion at Royston’s parish church on April 6, 2019.
The Royston Choral Society has been putting on concerts for the people of Royston since 1974 and the event is part of the society’s commitment to put on 4 concerts annually.
Huw Jenkins, Chairman of the Royston Choral Society said: “The Royston Choral Society has been a community unauditioned choir since 1974. We recently performed Britten’s War Requiem to high acclaim and will continue to rise to the challenges set by the musical director, Andrew O’Brien, with the performance of Bach’s St John Passion in the spring.
“We are most grateful for this grant from North Herts District Council as it will support the Royston Choral Society in its commitment to provide ‘Fine music made locally’.”
Councillor Tony Hunter, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;’s chairman of the Royston Committee, said: “We are pleased to be able support these projects in Royston. We look forward to seeing how the projects develop and progress in the future.”

Road/London Road/Watton Road and Station Road, is a known pinch point, particularly
when delays or incidents on the A1(M) result in the B197 being used as an alternate
route between Welwyn Garden City and Stevenage. There are also issues of poor
pedestrian/cycle access along Station Road under the railway line, and similar issues at
Gun Lane and new development will be expected to consider improvements to
walking/cycling conditions in these locations and make reasonable contributions to

&lt;p&gt;This is what the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EFF&lt;/span&gt; has to&amp;nbsp;say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite waves of calls and emails from European Internet users, the European Parliament today voted to accept the principle of a universal pre-emptive copyright filter for content-sharing sites, as well as the idea that news publishers should have the right to sue others for quoting news items online  or even using their titles as links to articles. Out of all of the potential amendments offered that would fix or ameliorate the damage caused by these proposals, they voted for worst on&amp;nbsp;offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; government has produced a pig of an app to do Covid-19 tracking (full details &lt;a href="https://privacyinternational.org/long-read/3752/coronavirus-tracking-uk-what-we-know-so-far"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Not only does it collect data in a way that is dangerous, it can easily be cloned by developers who will pass off their worse apps as the official one. Worst of all (but not from a privacy point of view) is that it needs to run in foreground. Why, oh why, did our government not chose the &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-google-announce-new-privacy-features-for-coronavirus-tracking-tech/"&gt;one jointly developed between Apple &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Google&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Update on the Station Pub</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/update-on-the-station-pub.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-09-10T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2018-09-10:/update-on-the-station-pub.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;The Saga&amp;nbsp;Continues&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next meeting of the Planning Control Committee is due to meet on Thursday 20th Sept to review the reasons for refusal of the applicationto redevelop the station pub (ref. 17/01622/1).
The general idea is to simplify the reasons for refusal to avoid the appeal being decided by a public enquiry, a very expensive process for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; and for everyone else.&lt;br&gt;
This is the link to the &lt;a href="https://democracy.north-herts.gov.uk/ieListDocuments.aspx?CId=151&amp;amp;MId=2051&amp;amp;Ver=4#AI2136"&gt;meeting agenda item&lt;/a&gt;.
The key document is &lt;a href="https://democracy.north-herts.gov.uk/documents/s3114/17016221%20-%20The%20Station%20Inn%20Station%20Approach%20Knebworth%20SG3%206AT.pdf"&gt;the officers&amp;#8217;s report&lt;/a&gt;, which recommends that:
* Reason 1 (loss of pub) is retained, but related to the new version of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPPF&lt;/span&gt; that is now in force, but a dependence on policy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETC7&lt;/span&gt; (change of use of shops etc.) is dropped,
* Reason 2 (cramped layout) is retained,
* Reason 3 (inadequate parking) is dropped, on the grounds that Herts Highways had no objection the original application,
* Reason 4 (noise and odour impacts) is dropped on the grounds that this can be mitigated in practice,
* Reason 5 (lack of completed S106 Obligation) is dropped on the grounds that it is likely one will be in place by the time the appeal takes place,
where Reason 1 etc. are the reasons originally given by the Planning Control Committee in its decision on 19th April 2018.

Sorry I haven&amp;#8217;t been posting much. I don&amp;#8217;t go to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; meetings any longer - yay! - and it&amp;#8217;s been the holiday season.
The Parish Council continues, and we are in danger of going up to full strength, which is no mean feat.
Graveley is struggling to  be quorate, which has required &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; to step in.
Members of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt; regularly discover they have better things to do with their time, so if you fancy serving the community in this capacity, it&amp;#8217;s always worth dropping a note to the Clerk to say that your&amp;#8217;e&amp;nbsp;interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Station Pub is a big issue. The appeal has been submitted and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOS&lt;/span&gt; Pub group are busily raising money and instructing experts to back up &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; in its decision to reject the original application. Their Facebook Group has the latest twists in that saga which, unfortunately, might run and run.
The two &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; members for Knebworth seem both very active on social media, particularly in the area of reporting of missed bins. It has to be said that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; did not exactly cover itself in glory over letting this new contract, especially as East Herts, which has the same contractor and a very similar service with the exception that it has universal brown bin collection, is experienced no difficulties, as far as I am aware.

The Lytton Arms was once again open for&amp;nbsp;business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pub has been upgraded in many ways, some visible, some less so:
- the kitchen has been totally refurbished and is now state of the art,
- the cellar has been re-fitted and can accommodate nine cask ales and a cask cider,
- the old conservatory with the fly-catching nets has gone, and in its place is a modern, warm replacement,
- the outside area (where the beer festival casks were set up) is now opened out right through to the boundary with the fields. This is a huge improvement on the old garden, and is perfect for this time of year,
- every square centimetre of paintwork has been renewed, and the colour scheme modernised,
- the roof and structural features of the building have all been&amp;nbsp;fixed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are probably more improvements, but the main thing for me is that the pub now has plenty of beer, quick food service, a 50% discount on food until the end of the month (search for the code, but you&amp;#8217;ll probably get it anyway if you ask), and a marvellous buzz of local residents enjoying a quiet drink in comfortable&amp;nbsp;surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason has now taken over the running of the pub, with a very able team, which includes Stef, who will be familiar to all the regulars from the late James Price&amp;#8217;s time running The Lytton. The pub is now part of &lt;a href="http://www.acinns.co.uk/"&gt;Anglian Country Inns&lt;/a&gt;, a highly professional operation run by Cliff Nye, brother of Steve Nye, former landlord at the&amp;nbsp;pub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current beers include Fat Sprat by Adnams,  Koha by Mad Squirrel, Happy People by Shiny People, Nelson&amp;#8217;s Revenge by Woodfords, Hawse Buckler by Oakham, Bring Me Sunshine by Tring, Lucky Lobster by Brancaster (part of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AC&lt;/span&gt; Inns), Tiki Blonde by Mad Squirrel, Squid Ink by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XT&lt;/span&gt;, Take 5 by Harpoon and Affligem by De Smelt as well as Rapple, a Raspberry cider by Apple Cottage. However, even as I type this some of these brews will have been replace. It&amp;#8217;s very unlikely you&amp;#8217;ll visit and not find anything interesting to&amp;nbsp;drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lytton now has its own social media presence: on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/TheLyttonArms/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/lyttonarms/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheLyttonArms"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Council Meeting of 11th April 2017 I voted to save  public consultation responses from the shredder. My political opponents are painting this as if I voted to build on fields all around Knebworth. As I have repeatedly said in the past, I am opposed to all Green Belt development around the&amp;nbsp;village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The actual resolutions I voted&amp;nbsp;for:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had a number of local residents contacting me stating that I voted for development to take place on sites around Knebworth. This is simply untrue.  In the meeting of the full Council on 11th April 2017, I voted for the following&amp;nbsp;motion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) That the results of the Proposed Submission consultation, as set out in the Regulation 22 Consultation Statement attached as Appendix 1 to the report, be noted and&amp;nbsp;recorded;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) That the new Local Plan for North Hertfordshire, attached as Appendix 2 to the report, together with the Schedule of Proposed Additional Modifications attached as Appendix 3, and other associated documentation, be approved and submitted for examination by the Secretary of&amp;nbsp;State;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(3) That the revised Local Development Scheme for North Hertfordshire, attached as Appendix 4 to the report, be approved with effect from 12 April&amp;nbsp;2017;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(4) That delegated powers be granted to the Head of Development and Building Control, in consultation with the Executive Member for Planning and Enterprise, to produce such additional documentation as is required (including documentation requested by the appointed Inspector and the proposing of main modifications) before and during the examination of the Local Plan;&amp;nbsp;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(5) That Officers continue to regularly update Members on the progress of the Examination through the Strategic Planning Matters reports which are submitted to&amp;nbsp;Cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;REASON&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DECISION&lt;/span&gt;: To ensure that North Hertfordshire continues to progress a new Local Plan for the management of development in the District.
Further details of the meeting, including Appendix 1 mentioned in the resolution may be read on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website &lt;a href="https://democracy.north-herts.gov.uk/CeListDocuments.aspx?CommitteeId=136&amp;amp;MeetingId=519&amp;amp;DF=11%2f04%2f2017&amp;amp;Ver=2"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
This motion is purely about allowing the public consultation that took place in late 2016 to be examined. This is not about the Council ignoring this consultation: under the very rigidly defined process for producing a Local Plan, &lt;strong&gt;responses to the consultation on the Draft Plan are examined by a Planning Inspector on behalf of the Secretary of State&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
There is no possibility of me voting to approve the Local Plan. Members of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; do not have the power to do this. This power is vested in the Secretary of State for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DCLG&lt;/span&gt;.  The Examination in Public finished last month, and the Inspector will use this as the basis on which to write his Report, which will be submitted to the Secretary of State for adoption. This may happen in 2019, at the earliest.
As I have written before, the Local Plan does not give permission for the development of any sites around Knebworth. Before any sites on the periphery of the village are developed they will have to obtain full planning permission which will include the normal consultation process that is required before planning permission is granted. This will be withheld unless applicants can demonstrate that access and supporting infrastructure are&amp;nbsp;adequate.&lt;/p&gt;

Knebworth Scout and Guide Group was awarded &amp;pound;32,000 for essential maintenance to its circa 1950’s headquarters. The funding will be put towards roofing, paving and drainage repairs. It is hoped that further funding will be available from the Knebworth Village Trust, which provides capital grants to organisations which are wholly or mainly for the use of residents of the parish of Knebworth.
The Community Facilities Capital Grant funds will extend the lifespan of the buildings and will continue to help these facilities remain at the heart of the communities they serve.
The grant funding follows a commitment made by the Council in 2016 to make &amp;pound;1.2 million available over a four year period to help enhance and sustain community facilities across the District.
Other awards went to North Herts Minority Ethnic Forum, which was awarded &amp;pound;50,000 to help build an extension which will be used as a meeting room at their headquarters in Whinbush Road, Hitchin.
Baldock Arts and Heritage Centre was awarded &amp;pound;50,000 towards the conversion of the Old Fire Station, which is part of their building, into a new heritage area.
Hitchin Educational Foundation was awarded &amp;pound;50,000 towards the renovation of a derelict Scout hall on land between Bancroft and Grammar School Walk.
Pirton Village Hall was awarded &amp;pound;45,000 to build a multi-purpose room for community groups to use.
Barkway Village Hall was awarded &amp;pound;15,000 to create a new emergency exit and renovate their kitchen area.

available, can all be viewed on the website through the following link: &lt;a href="https://www.north-herts.gov.uk/planning/planning-policy/localplan/local-plan-examination/examination-actions"&gt;www.north-herts.gov.uk/planning/planning-policy/localplan/local-plan-examination/examination-actions&lt;/a&gt;.
When the Inspector has all the documents arising out of the actions he will take
a view on whether he requires any further information on any of the
matters examined during the hearing&amp;nbsp;sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where representors have not yet had the opportunity to provide
written comments on documents provided by the Council, he will be
inviting them to do so in May. As with hearing statements,
representors will only be able to comment on documents that are
relevant to the issues raised in their regulation 19 responses. The
Programme Officer will contact all regulation 19 respondents in May
to notify them of the details and deadline for the provision of&amp;nbsp;comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Inspector will then invite the Council to respond to these.
The timetable for the proposed main modifications cannot be
defined at this stage, but they will be subject to the normal six
week consultation period. Following this my report will be sent to
the Council to allow it to check the main modifications for factual&amp;nbsp;accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>New Southern Rural grant funding available for 2018/19</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/new-southern-rural-grant-funding-available-for-201819.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-04-15T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2018-04-15:/new-southern-rural-grant-funding-available-for-201819.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;New Southern Rural grant funding available for&amp;nbsp;2018/19&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a result of the decision not to cease Area Committee Grants in the February Council Meeting when the Revenue Budget was agreed, residents of North Herts once again have the opportunity to apply for grants from Area Committees.
If you are a local charity, voluntary group or not for profit organisation you are eligible for a share of its almost &amp;pound;90,000 grant funding pot in 2018-19.
The Council provides grants to voluntary groups and not-for-profits through its five Area Committees. These can be used to launch a new project or advance an existing project to a new stage, as long as there is a positive benefit to the community.
Each Committee, which meet four times a year in June, September, December and March, is allocated an amount of grant funding to give to appropriate projects, depending on the population they serve.
To make an application:
* Make sure you apply well in advance of when you will need the funding as the process can take a few months, taking into account the Committee meeting schedule.
* Complete an application form and submit it along with your group’s latest accounts and Constitution.
* You will then be invited to come along to a meeting to give a brief presentation to the Committee. Following which the Councillors on the Committee vote and you will find out if your application has been successful.
The process is simple and straight forward, but if you need any assistance our Communities team are on hand to provide help and advice throughout the process.
The next deadline to apply for funding is 5pm on Friday 4 May.
If you apply for this funding round and are successful, you would receive the funding around the end of June.
Many community groups in Knebworth have benefited in the past, including the Bowls Club, the Football Club, Knebworth Day Care the Twinning Association. New rules mean that Knebworth Parish Council, which has applied for, and been granted, funds in the past are now barred, because of a tightening up of eligibility criteria to exclude precepting bodies (the Parish Council can raise funds via Council Tax directly). This means that there has been a shortage of qualifying applicants in the past year: an opportunity for your group to apply this year.
To find out if your group might be eligible for grant funding, visit the Grants page on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website: www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/community/grants/area-committee-grants

This is the anti-social habit of drivers parking with one (or more) pairs of wheels on the grass verge, turning it into a muddy wreck.
The solution is to contact:
1.  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HCC&lt;/span&gt; – Herts Highways are responsible for putting bollards on grass verges as these areas are part of the highway.  This is something you could approach Cllr Thake about as he could consider using his Herts locality budget to install some bollards in this location.
2.  The second option is to check if there are any road markings on the street that go past the premises, as technically such restrictions continue to the back of the pavement. If there are road markings in this location then I you could approach Jon Charter, Parking Service Manager to investigate the issue from a parking enforcement point of view. Jon’s contact details are as follows: Email. Jon.charter@north-herts.gov.uk, Tel. 01462 474358.
I know this is not a total solution, but it does give a few&amp;nbsp;options.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Knebworth JMI Environmental Area</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/knebworth-jmi-environmental-area.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-31T17:42:37+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2018-03-31:/knebworth-jmi-environmental-area.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;The Environmental Area, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AKA&lt;/span&gt; the Wildlife&amp;nbsp;Haven&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was fascinating to see the Knebworth Primary School Environmental Area when I visited the school on Friday, 31st March for the official opening, with Stephen McPartland &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MP&lt;/span&gt;. I have never really ventured very far beyond the dining room in the school (where Knebworth Village Trust meetings are&amp;nbsp;held).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, thanks to many weeks of hard work put in by Alena Evans of &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/EvansonEarthgardens/"&gt;Evans on Earth&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EA&lt;/span&gt; is finished. It will need a lot of ongoing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TLC&lt;/span&gt;, but there is an amazing range of things to do in a reasonably compact area. I hope that staff members in the school will exploit this valuable new resource to the&amp;nbsp;full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alena provided me with the following notes on the project, which I thought would be interesting to share with&amp;nbsp;you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;History of the&amp;nbsp;project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole process startwd in the autumn of 2017. Alena Evans and Mrs Bishop (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TA&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KS1&lt;/span&gt; and she used to run our gardening club) created a plan  to restore the environmental area. It has been refurbished in 2013 but had suffered from neglect shortly afterwards. The pond was restored and lots of other work was carried out but unfortunately without any ongoing maintenance the area got overgrown. &lt;br&gt;
The plan was created but no budget was available. Children wrote letters to companies asking for donation towards the redevelopment.  They were very lucky and the donation started to come in from a range of local businesses and&amp;nbsp;individuals.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clearance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first action was to create more seating areas, storage and places of interest.   Alena and the team installed a used shed. It was destined for skip but with a new roof and floor, it&amp;#8217;s now great. It provides storage for  gardening&amp;nbsp;tools.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vegetables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vegetable bed was too big. With only half an hour a week of gardening club it wasn&amp;#8217;t manageable. ( We have no gardening club at this moment). So the bed was filled with shingle, slugs don&amp;#8217;t like crawling across.&lt;br&gt;
New raised planters were sourced. These are big enough for growing veggies and herbs and hopefully easy to manage. Three of the planters were made from different leftovers of wood and two were a donation. Planters have quotes written on. As it gives the teachers opportunity to use them not just for growing but for English as&amp;nbsp;well.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Greenhouse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already had the greenhouse but unfortunately it was outside of the area, in the school grounds. That made it difficult for teachers to use. So it was taken apart and put back together in more suitable&amp;nbsp;place.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outdoor&amp;nbsp;Classroom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existing classroom had a new white board fitted up. You can also see several book/author quotes in the classroom.  The older children get the more quotes they should recognise. Quotes are from books they read at school. Quotes have no attribution on purpose.  And there still is lots of space to add more. &lt;br&gt;
Next to the classroom is another storage cupboard. This one is for teaching supplies only. It contains stationary, very old scales, Viking and Egyptian hieroglyphs, number and letter stones, story stones for each year group, etc. There is also a list of activities related to different parts of&amp;nbsp;curriculum.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fairy&amp;nbsp;Garden&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team has created a fairy garden. Especially for younger years. It should help with imagination and story telling. Children can also create their own fairy gardens.  They have boxes with &amp;#8220;loose parts&amp;#8221; in the greenhouse.  They can use sticks, pinecones, bark,&amp;nbsp;seashell.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bug&amp;nbsp;Hotel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bug house was rebuild from untidy mess into a 5*hotel.  A &amp;#8220;Checkers&amp;#8221; seating area with a board for games was built from leftover landscaping materials. 
As you might have noticed there are lots of  ridge tiles through out the garden.  These ridges came from the actual school roof after last year&amp;#8217;s renovation. There for they are over 100 years old and great part of the school&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;history.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Literature in a Garden&amp;nbsp;Setting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the newly added seating areas in &amp;#8220;Narnia corner&amp;#8221;.
The bench was given to us but it was in unusable state. We replaced the slats. It was suppose to be just a bench by the lions in the armrests sparked our imagination.  Quote for Chronicles of Narnia was added. And then the lamp post. Someone had the actual lamp sitting in garage for years. Now we just need a post.  The post came from the old Hamilton site, before it was demolished.  It consists of two pool table legs: a small piece of Knebworth history.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A mouse took a stroll through the deep dark wood.  And if you look carefully, you can just about see it. But be careful the snake, owl and fox are hiding close by.&lt;/em&gt;
Another new seating are is our reading nook. The whole nook was built from leftover landscaping materials that would have just ended up in the skip. Apart from the sail. The sail was one of the few things we bought.  Luckily we have received a financial donation as well. &lt;br&gt;
Things we had to buy were: compost for raised planters, plants,&amp;nbsp;sail.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Pond&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least. Pond seating area. Bench was discovered on clearance job. Once again it only need a bit of paint and new slats.&lt;br&gt;
We installed a box for pond dipping weeds. Box has gaps big enough for any bugs being able to crawl out back to the&amp;nbsp;pond.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wild flowers&amp;nbsp;area.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already had the bench. It has plaque with signatures of people who were involved in the rebuit in 2013.&lt;br&gt;
We have installed the picket fence  for couple of reasons.  It is the only area we don&amp;#8217;t mind nettles, brambles to grow. Nettles are a feeding plant for butterfly caterpillars. We will have some foxgloves growing there as well. And it&amp;#8217;s an area we don&amp;#8217;t want children to pick plants from. Everywhere else they are ok to cut and chop. As long as they follow the simple rule of foraging.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;One for the bees, one for birds, one for bugs, one for butterflies and one for me.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;
It has been decided that the  Environment Area should be given a new name: &lt;strong&gt;The Wildlife haven&lt;/strong&gt;. This is so recent a decision that the sign has not yet been&amp;nbsp;made.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Self-build and Custom Build Register</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/self-build-and-custom-build-register.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-27T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2018-03-27:/self-build-and-custom-build-register.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Self-build and Custom Build&amp;nbsp;Register&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You can use &lt;a href="https://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/planning/planning-policy/self-build-and-custom-build-register"&gt;The North Herts Self Build and Custom Build Register&lt;/a&gt;   to register yourself as wanting a plot in the District for a self-build home.
New rules came into effect on 31 October 2016 which amended the Self-build and Custom Housebuilding Act 2015 and implemented Chapter 2 of the Housing and Planning Act 2016 which sets out provisions to support self-build and custom housebuilding.
This means that the second and final part of the Right to Build, placing a duty on relevant authorities to make land available to meet the demand on their self-build and custom housebuilding registers, has now come into force and the Right to Build is now fully implemented.
The legislation requires ‘relevant authorities’ to keep a register of individuals and associations of individuals who are seeking to acquire serviced plots of land in the authority’s area and to have regard to that register when carrying out their functions. Unless exempt, they also have a legal duty to grant sufficient ‘development permissions’ to meet the demand for self-build and custom housebuilding in their area.
Regulation 2 (Time for compliance with duty to grant planning permission) specifies three years as the period within which the required number of development permissions relating to a ‘base period’ must be granted to satisfy the duty (as set out in the Housing and Planning Act&amp;nbsp;2016).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Aggregates Yard Planning Application</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/aggregates-yard-planning-application.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2018-03-16:/aggregates-yard-planning-application.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I spoke at &lt;a href="http://web.north-herts.gov.uk/aksnherts/users/public/admin/kab14.pl?operation=SUBMIT&amp;amp;meet=135&amp;amp;cmte=PCC&amp;amp;grpid=public&amp;amp;arc=71"&gt;a Planning Control Committee meeting&lt;/a&gt;.

This is the conversion of the old aggregates yard, part of Chas Lowe &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Sons, into two 2-bed flats and two commercial (retail) units. The grounds on which we objected were principally to do with parking.
Although we did our best to convince the committee to refuse permission, only two members agreed with us. The minimum parking standards had not been met, but the committee accepted that the location justified relaxing the standard. The full argument, as well as the text of the Parish Council objection, can be read in &lt;a href="http://web.north-herts.gov.uk/aksnherts/images/att13450.docx"&gt;the report of the Planning officer&lt;/a&gt;.
In a case like this, where the vote goes the &amp;#8216;wrong&amp;#8217; way, my view is that the time has not been wasted as the committee&amp;#8217;s attention is drawn to the desperately bad parking situation in the village, and may be less inclined to grant another similar application, having, perhaps, more appreciation of the severe cumulative impact of so many high-density developments going on in Knebworth.

Questions include:
1.      What evidence is there of unauthorised development and encampments in your community, and what issues does this raise for the local community?
2.      We would like to invite evidence of unauthorised encampments which have occurred in the last 2 years, as follows:
    * the number of instances where trespassers have occupied land without authorisation, including the location and scale of the encampment.
    * whether the land in a) required cleaning or repair once the encampment had left, and if so, what was the cost?
    * how was each unauthorised encampment encouraged to leave, how long did it take, and was the local authority able to move them on; or did the police became involved?
3.      Do you think that the existing powers made available to local authorities to remove unauthorised campers from land are effective?
4.      Do you think local authorities could improve their use of existing powers?
5.      What other powers may help local authorities deal with unauthorised encampments?
6.      Do you consider that the current powers for police to direct trespassers to leave land are effective?
7.      Would any new or revised powers that enable police to direct trespassers to leave land make it easier to deal with unauthorised encampments?
8.      Do you consider that the Government should consider criminalising unauthorised encampments, in addition to the offence of aggravated trespass? If so, how should a new offence differ, and what actions and circumstances should it apply to?
9.      What barriers are there to the greater use of injunctions by local authorities, where appropriate, and how might they be overcome?
10.  Do you have any suggestions or examples of how local authorities, the police, the courts and communities can work together more successfully to improve community relations and address issues raised by unauthorised encampments?
11.  Are there ways in which court processes might be modified in a proportionate way to ensure unauthorised encampments can be addressed more quickly?
12.  In your view, what would the advantages and disadvantages be of extending the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IPO&lt;/span&gt; process to open land? Are you aware of any specific barriers which prevent the effective use of current planning enforcement powers?
13.  If you are aware of any specific barriers to effective enforcement, are there any resourcing or administrative arrangements that can help overcome them?
14.  Are you aware of any specific barriers which prevent the effective use of temporary stop notices? If so, do you have a view on how these barriers can be overcome?
15.  How do you think the existing enforcement notice appeals process can be improved or streamlined?
16.  How can Government make existing guidance more effective in informing and changing behaviour?
17.  If future guidance was issued as statutory guidance, would this help in taking action against unauthorised development and encampments?
18.  Are there any specific barriers to the provision of more authorised permanent and transit sites? If so, is there any action that the Government could take to help overcome those barriers?
19.  What impact would extending local authority, police or land owner powers have on children and families and other groups with protected characteristics that public authorities must, in the exercise of its functions, have due regard to under their Public Sector Equality Duty?
20.  Do you expect that extending the powers referred to above would have a positive or negative impact on the health or educational outcomes of Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities? If so, do you have any evidence to support this view, and/or suggestions for what could be done to mitigate or prevent any negative impacts?

&lt;p&gt;To keep costs to a minimum &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; is asking everyone who can to use the online option, but &lt;em&gt;you can pay by phone&lt;/em&gt; via the general number, 01462 474000, and selecting waste services. The cost is &amp;pound;40 a year for one bin, with an early bird discount of &amp;pound;35 available if you sign up by the end of March. Payment can be by debit or credit&amp;nbsp;card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Budget&amp;nbsp;2018-19&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The budget for 2018-19 was agreed at the full council meeting held in February. Total net budgeted expenditure will be &amp;pound;14.6m. To give some context, in 2010, total net spend for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; was running at &amp;pound;18m. Throughout the long march to reduce costs, the focus for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; has been to protect front-line services: those which directly affect residents of North Herts.
Of the &amp;pound;14.6m net expenditure, Council Tax will pay for the lion&amp;#8217;s share, &amp;pound;11m, and the rest comes from Business Rates and New Homes Bonus. There are considerable increased costs flowing through as a result of various inflationary and contractual&amp;nbsp;increases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offsetting these increases are savings, primarily from the new Waste Collection and Street Cleaning contract which covers all the services the council must provide as a statutory obligation. This is around &amp;pound;2m per annum cheaper than the current one with Veolia, which has been running for 14 years, and some additional savings are expected in&amp;nbsp;2019-20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result of all this effort is that the increase in Council Tax for next year will be &amp;pound;6.49 for a Band D property for the year, to &amp;pound;223.45. Your total Council Tax bill is much higher than this as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; collects the tax on behalf of Herts County Council, the Herts Police, and Knebworth Parish&amp;nbsp;Council.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Who Do I Call When I Want to Call The Council?</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/who-do-i-call-when-i-want-to-call-the-council.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-02-15T17:03:12+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2018-02-15:/who-do-i-call-when-i-want-to-call-the-council.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Who Do I Call When I Want to Call The&amp;nbsp;Council?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;North Herts District&amp;nbsp;Council&lt;/h2&gt;

The potential joint venture between the …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Councillors to consider potential scheme to regenerate Hitchin’s Churchgate&amp;nbsp;Centre&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new potential joint venture opportunity for the regeneration of the Churchgate Centre in Hitchin will be discussed at a meeting of North Hertfordshire District Council’s (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;) Full Council on 8 February.
The potential joint venture between the Council and Shearer Property Group would see a ‘face-lift’ of the existing shopping centre, improving the quality of the units available and in turn making them more attractive to retailers. The scheme would also see improved public open space and investment in Hitchin’s historic market.
At the meeting Councillors will be asked to consider supporting the principle of a joint venture regeneration of the Churchgate Centre, with the Council as funder of the regeneration. In return the Council would receive the lion’s share of the ongoing revenue generated. The Shearer Property Group would provide their specialist expertise and knowledge, essential to making a scheme such as this a success. If the principle is supported further detailed work would then be undertaken to ensure the proposals were deliverable, before a final decision is made.
The Council has been seeking to regenerate this area of Hitchin for many years, however previous potential schemes have come up against a number of challenges, including the size of the scheme, the cost of buying, knocking down and rebuilding the shopping centre and finding a suitable location for the market. It is hoped that the proposal for a smaller regeneration, which does not propose knocking down the Churchgate centre will address many of the previous concerns.
Cllr Lynda Needham, Leader of the Council&amp;nbsp;said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are pleased that the regeneration of Churchgate is back on the agenda. The proposals would improve the retail offer in Hitchin, bring much needed investment to Hitchin Market and make the surrounding area more attractive, as well as provide an investment opportunity for the Council.
We know that the people of Hitchin are keen to see a suitable proposal come forward for the area and we look forward to debating this potential joint venture opportunity on 8&amp;nbsp;February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long-awaited application for redevelopment of the Station Pub site (Planning Reference 17/01622/1) is likely to come before the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Planning Control Committee this month, on the 15th February, probably in the Spirella Building in Letchworth. If you plan to attend, please check on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC …&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Station&amp;nbsp;Pub&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long-awaited application for redevelopment of the Station Pub site (Planning Reference 17/01622/1) is likely to come before the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Planning Control Committee this month, on the 15th February, probably in the Spirella Building in Letchworth. If you plan to attend, please check on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website for confirmation that the application is on the agenda. The start time of the meeting will be 7:30pm, but this application will be one of potentially many all of which will be decided at this&amp;nbsp;meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has taken a long time for the application to come before the Committee. I do not know why this is, but a frequent reason is because the negotiations between the developer and the officers for Section 106 Contributions have been drawn&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an application comes before the Committee the members will have visited the site and read all the associated paperwork, including the objections and plans. Particular attention will be given to the responses from the statutory consultees, especially Herts Highways and Knebworth Parish Council. Committee members will rely on the report of the planning officer for guidance on which policies are relevant and to what extent the application complies with them. This is the job of the committee, to decide whether or not the officer has, in his professional capacity, missed any valid planning ground (i.e. breach of policy) on which the application might be&amp;nbsp;refused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meeting, the planning officer involved will introduce his report and summarize the main findings, including his recommendation. If this is to refuse the application, it is very unlikely the Committee will go against his recommendation. However, if the recommendation is to grant, it will need to have some fairly compelling reasons why. The objectors will have to provide these compelling reasons, all in a speech lasting no longer than five&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the local ward member I, or my fellow councillor, may speak in support of the objector for a further five minutes. The applicant is also allowed to speak for this amount of time, to rebut any of the arguments put forward by the objectors. After the speeches, the committee may ask  of the speakers about their&amp;nbsp;comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee will then debate the application until one of them proposes a motion to refuse the application or to grant it, possibly with additional conditions to those recommended in the report. If the motion is to grant, and the vote is passed, the applicant is free to proceed with construction. No appeal is possible in this&amp;nbsp;event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the motion is to refuse, and it is passed, the applicant has up to six months to appeal to the Planning Inspector. Or he has the option to submit a new application, presumably somewhat amended to take account of the reason for&amp;nbsp;refusal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the Planning Control Committee are not professional planners. They are elected District Council members. They are heavily dependent on guidance from planning professionals to make their decisions. Planning law is complex, and even the council&amp;#8217;s own planning officers sometimes need to call in specialist advice. However, they are attuned to local need and I am sure they will arrive at the right decision as long as they are in possession of all the arguments for and against the&amp;nbsp;application. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>January Parish News Article</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/january-parish-news-article.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-12-30T16:40:07+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2017-12-30:/january-parish-news-article.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Garden Waste&amp;nbsp;Bins&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of you will be aware of the new charging regime for garden waste bins being introduced this year. Removal of household waste remains a statutory obligation for the Council, and not one that it may charge for. This includes food waste which will be collected weekly from food caddies to be provided. While this will mean an additional container, the alternative would be to allow food waste to be put in the ‘residual waste’ (i.e. purple) bins. Although this would have saved money, it was considered a worse option from an environmental point of view and was rejected. The new caddies will be 23l in capacity, enough for a week, so considerably bigger than the old ones, which are at most&amp;nbsp;4l.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Householders who pay for garden waste bins will be able to continue to use them for food waste, but with a fortnightly collection, and leave their new caddy unused. Bonfires are allowed, provided they do not create a nuisance, which can reduce garden waste; householders may have more than one brown bin (at &amp;pound;40 pa each) or can&amp;nbsp;share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Forthcoming &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;meetings&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Cabinet on 21st January is expected to review the revenue budget and capital spending programme for the next civic year; these items will be referred to full Council on 8 February&amp;nbsp;2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both these meetings are open to members of the public. Please check the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website for details of the location for each meeting as the District Council offices in Gernon Road are currently out of action. The office refurbishment is expected to be finished by the end of the first&amp;nbsp;quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Enhanced provision for the&amp;nbsp;homeless&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; remains responsible for homelessness, even though it no longer owns any housing stock having transferred its former stock to North Herts Homes in&amp;nbsp;2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although homelessness in North Herts is very low (at the last count under five families), for those affected it can be devastating, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; has a number of housing officers who help avoid homelessness and provide assistance to those affected. Currently, in some cases, families can end up being housed in temporary accommodation in adjacent areas. The Homelessness Reduction Act 2017, which comes into force in April 2018, is likely to increase the load on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; who are actively considering establishing a Housing Company that will own residential accommodation to be used for temporary&amp;nbsp;accommodation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; is progressing with the new contract for the household waste
collection service, jointly with East Herts. The winning bidder was a
company called Urbaser who, while new to North Herts are the third
largest environmental services provider across Europe. The contract for
basic waste collection has been agreed with a more minor part of the
contract to be signed. The contract represents a significant saving for
Council Tax payers. It is expected that most operatives will transfer
their employment from&amp;nbsp;Veolia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of discussion about the decision of the Council to
charge &amp;pound;40 per bin per year for garden waste collection from the 2018
civic year. Residents will be able to share a bin (and its cost) with a
neighbour when the volume of garden waste produced does not warrant
paying for a whole bin, and can also have more than one bin. The charge
for brown bin collection is not expected to fully offset the cost of
collection, but will help to reduce the serious revenue deficit &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;
has, with savings of &amp;pound;4.2m per year targeted by&amp;nbsp;2021/22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food waste will be collected from new, larger, caddies weekly: an
improvement in the level of service compared to today. Home composting
is a very green alternative to paying for brown bin collection. The
Hertfordshire WasteAware Partnership provides home compost bins to
Hertfordshire residents at subsidized prices. To order a compost bin
call 0844 571 4444 or visit

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Local Plan -&amp;nbsp;Examination&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Examination in
Public of the Local Plan started on the 13th November, the Inspector is
Simon Berkeley. The first couple of weeks focus on strategic matters,
such as the duty of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; to cooperate with adjoining authorities to take
housing that they themselves cannot deliver (this especially applies to
Luton), and then on the Countryside and Green Belt, the housing mix and
the spatial distribution of new housing. Evidence is on the
deliverability of the plan and the &amp;#39;high level&amp;#39; issues: i.e. without
any reference to individual sites or the allocations to&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The allocations to individual sites will be examined in Week 6 of the enquiry, the sites around Knebworth specifically being examined on the morning of Monday 26th February. These sessions are all open to the public and are held in the Icknield Centre, Icknield Way in Letchworth. Full details are on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s website.

&lt;p&gt;2018 will be the Year of Physical Activity in Hertfordshire &amp;#8212; an
initiative being led by Hertfordshire&amp;#8217;s 10 District and Borough
Councils, Public Health Hertfordshire and the Herts Sports and Physical
Activity Partnership. The year will be kicking off on January&amp;nbsp;1st.**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of the project is to make Hertfordshire, England&amp;#8217;s most active
county and in doing so, help to shift some of the stubborn inactivity
levels to be found across the county. Hertfordshire Year of Physical
Activity 2018 - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HYOPA18&lt;/span&gt; - will also enable us to shine a light on
existing programmes and opportunities for our residents to get involved
in physical activity and&amp;nbsp;sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project also offers an opportunity for existing organisations to
develop new projects and programmes, which can be used to encourage more
people in the county to be more active, more&amp;nbsp;often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst there is no dedicated central funding pot to support such
programmes, there are a number of potential funding streams which can be
accessed to support those initiatives linked to the Hertfordshire Year
of Physical Activity&amp;nbsp;2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the fund administrators has been notified about what we are
trying to achieve and each has indicated that they will be receptive to
appropriate, well-written bids which contribute to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HYOPA&lt;/span&gt; 18&amp;nbsp;outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, our funding partner, Richard Sutcliffe of Funding4Sport is
available to offer advice on any such bids, and, where required, to
formulate those bids on your behalf &amp;#8212; subject to a small charge.
Details of the support available from Funding4Sport can be found at
&lt;a href="http://www.sportinherts.org.uk/page/funding/funding-support-for-clubs/hsp-funding-offer-6523/"&gt;http://www.sportinherts.org.uk/page/funding/funding-support-for-clubs/hsp-funding-offer-6523/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 1 in 3 of our residents not meeting the Chief Medical Officer&amp;#8217;s
recommended levels of physical activity and around 1 in 5 (18.4%) doing
less than 30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise each week, we are
facing a major challenge if we are to ensure that those residents can
live long lives in good health, free from disability for as long as
possible. We are calling on all organisations to be part of this

&lt;h3&gt;Herts County Council Locality&amp;nbsp;Budgets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The County Council through its commitment to localism is seeking to
increase the opportunities for local councillors and communities to
decide how money is spent in their community. Each elected member of the
County Council has &amp;pound;10,000 to spend on worthwhile projects in their
community that promote social, economic or environmental wellbeing.
Physical activity projects have been supported in the past and proposals
that can achieve local benefits may be well&amp;nbsp;received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An undecided planning application for a Gypsy and Traveller site at
Pottersheath illustrates some of the complexity around the
interpretation of national planning policy, as well as the diverse roles
of the Local Planning Authority (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;), the local Ward councillors, the
Planning Control Committee, as supported by the planning officers and
the Planning Inspectorate. The law provides for some local autonomy in
deciding planning applications, but this often falls short of what those
who are most affected would&amp;nbsp;want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pottersheath site is in Knebworth Ward for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; and Codicote Parish.
It is in the Green Belt and applications to develop it had repeatedly
been refused by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;, the Local Planning Authority. Last year it was
occupied by travellers, and a retrospective application was made to use
it as a site for gypsies and travellers, reviewed by the Planning
Control Committee of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; in&amp;nbsp;January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a considerable number of objectors, and in my capacity of
“member advocate” I objected to the application, as did Cllr Jane Gray,
the councillor for Codicote. The Committee refused the application,
which went against the recommendation of the officers. This itself is a
relatively unusual circumstance: the members of the committee naturally
look to the planning officers, who are all professionally qualified, for
an interpretation of the complex and extensive canon of planning law.
When an application comes before the committee, the officers prepare a
report for the committee; in this case the recommendation was to grant
the application, albeit for a temporary&amp;nbsp;period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An appeal was lodged against the decision. As the application included
policy aspects, the planning inspectorate decided on a Public Enquiry,
rather than the more usual public hearing. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; commissioned further
work to defend the Committee’s decision, engaged the services of an
expert witness to interpret over 1,000 pages of new evidence submitted
by the applicant, as well as counsel to present the evidence. Based on
this, advice given to the Committee was that the decision made in
January could no longer be&amp;nbsp;defended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the expert witness employed by objectors reached a contrary
conclusion. At the Committee’s October meeting I, together with Cllr
Gray, again supported the objectors, seeking for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; to continue to
defend its decision at the Public Enquiry. Disappointingly, the
Committee decided that it would not make a defence. The objectors were,
of course, disappointed by this decision: had this application not been
made retrospectively, the personal circumstances of the applicants would
not have been taken into account, and, therefore, would not have been
able to form the &amp;#8216;very special circumstances&amp;#8217; required to block
inappropriate development in the Green Belt; their expert witness
outlines evidence in defence of the&amp;nbsp;decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This experience allows us to draw several lessons, which may be borne in
mind as other applications affecting Knebworth, such as for The Station
Pub, progress through the legal planning&amp;nbsp;procedure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the &amp;#8216;very special circumstances&amp;#8217; which are needed to justify
    development in the Green Belt are extremely wide ranging, and
    certainly include a lack of supply in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; area and may include
    the personal circumstances of the&amp;nbsp;applicant;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a refusal by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; is in general not the final step in the
    determination of a planning application. A well-funded applicant can
    choose to appeal and have the decision made by a Planning Inspector,
    who will decide the application on the basis of&amp;nbsp;evidence;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the ability to withstand applications for inappropriate development
    in the Green Belt depends critically on an adequate supply of
    appropriate sites in the Local&amp;nbsp;Plan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when the balance of supply and demand of sites changes in the
    District, applications which were refused in the past may have to
    be&amp;nbsp;granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Corporate Plan was approved at the Council Meeting this month.
It has, in addition to specifying how the Council plans to deliver its
objectives, a useful set of statistics about the District. In common
with most of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, the population of the District is getting older,
but by a huge relative amount in the case of some age groups. The number
of residents who are 90 years or older is expected to increase by around
two and a half times by 2037, for example. Inevitably, this will lead to
an even greater increase in number of unpaid carers, some of whom are
themselves elderly. Around 2,500 residents (out of a total of 131,000)
say they already provide 50 hours or more of unpaid care per&amp;nbsp;week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Access to Social Housing and Help for&amp;nbsp;Homeless&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; has a duty to help homeless individuals and families find somewhere
to live, even though it handed its housing stock over to North Herts
Homes in 2004. Occasionally resorting to bed and breakfast accommodation
temporarily although it strives to avoid this. The Housing Options Team
are very experienced at helping those who are worried about being made
homeless, and work closely with agencies such as Herts Young Homeless
and the Citizens Advice&amp;nbsp;Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; also administers the Common Housing Allocation Scheme (&amp;#8216;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHAS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;) and
the Common Housing Register jointly with North Herts Homes. This allows
people to apply for social housing via a single register, including the
homes available through the significant number of housing associations
which operate in North Herts in addition to North Herts Homes. To find
out more, search for &amp;#8216;Common Housing Register&amp;#8217; in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website or
call 01438 474000 and ask to speak to the Housing&amp;nbsp;Dept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan in Public&amp;nbsp;Examination&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Examination in Public of the Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan has started:
the first meeting was scheduled for the 21st Sept. North Herts are
somewhat behind its southerly neighbour, but the examination of its plan
is imminent. The Local Development Scheme states that it should be
complete by the end of&amp;nbsp;December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Waste &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Street Cleaning&amp;nbsp;Contract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiations on the new Waste and Street Cleaning Contract are at an
advanced stage. The contract will form the agenda for a joint meeting of
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Cabinet and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EHDC&lt;/span&gt; Executive Committee on Monday 16th October.
For more details see the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website. All Cabinet meetings are open to

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; has reviewed its byelaws, some of which date back to the 19th
Century, and have no relevance today. The recommendation is to revoke
all existing byelaws with the exception of the 2007 Acupuncture,
Tattooing, Semi-Permanent Skin-Colouring, Cosmetic Piercing and
Electrolysis&amp;nbsp;byelaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases the byelaws, many of which related to enforcement of
sanitary practices in commercial premises and to the prohibition of
antisocial behaviour in public places have been superseded by more
modern national statutes. For example, there is a 1874 byelaw that
relates to licencing of &amp;#8216;Omnibuses, Wagonettes &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Stage Carriages and the
Proprietors, Drivers and Conductors&amp;nbsp;thereof&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; are conducting a public consultation on this which ends on 22nd
September. Details can be accessed via the website and copies of the
survey, council report and the byelaws schedule are available at the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; reception desk upon request during normal office&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Upgrade to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;’s Planning Portal&amp;nbsp;Software&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers will be pleased to learn that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; has upgraded its planning
portal software. The system does not look noticeably different, but it
seems to be more responsive, and it certainly has had much better
&amp;#8216;uptime&amp;#8217; than previously. It is a pity that the upgrade coincided with
the consultation on the Station Pub redevelopment (ref. 17/01622/1). In
the end 181 responses were received which, hopefully, will have captured
all the valid planning issues that the application raised. No date has
yet been set for the Committee meeting at which the application will be
decided. Note that it is not possible to appeal against a decision to
grant an application, although it is possible to appeal against a&amp;nbsp;refusal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some local residents have questioned the need for respondents to
planning applications to provide their name and address to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;. I have
queried this and have been assured that, in fact, responses without an
address will still be taken into account. The only requirement is for
respondents to provide some contact details, so the officers can get in
touch if the response is ambiguous, or if an amendment to the
application is received. If you wish to make a representation, you
should be aware that your comments will be made&amp;nbsp;public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another planning application in Knebworth that readers may wish to
consider is the redevelopment of the Chas Lowe site (reference
17/01863/1). The proposal is for the demolition of the existing
buildings and the erection of 48 assisted living extra care (Class C2)
apartments for the frail elderly, including communal facilities and car
parking along with ground floor commercial unit (Use A1, A2, A3, D1 or
D2) fronting London Road. The deadline for responding to this is the 6th&amp;nbsp;September.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>August Newsletter - Knebworth Parish News</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/august-newsletter-knebworth-parish-news.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-07-17T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2017-07-17:/august-newsletter-knebworth-parish-news.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;August Newsletter - Knebworth Parish&amp;nbsp;News&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Station Pub Planning&amp;nbsp;Application&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A planning application, Ref. 17/01622/1, which has been submitted to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; to re-develop the site of the Station Hotel (aka the Station Pub) to provide nine two bed and five one bed dwellings, in addition to the existing bar area. The &amp;#8216;Save Our Station Pub&amp;#8217; campaign team is looking at valid planning grounds on which this application might be challenged. Please see the article elsewhere in this edition for more&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Waste Collection and Street Cleansing&amp;nbsp;Contract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waste collection and street cleansing are a big part of what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; does. More than a third of its overall expenditure goes on this one item. The work is contracted out to Veolia currently, but under current procurement rules the Council must undertake market testing and cannot simply renew the existing&amp;nbsp;contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some while ago it was decided to jointly procure this service with East Herts District Council, in order to realize some economies of scale. With a jointly let contract it will be possible to avoid duplication of contract monitoring and customer support and it should be feasible to introduce much more up to date technology for both these services. It should also be possible to operate a single waste transfer station: the facility at which waste is transferred from District Council collection vehicles to County Council vehicles for&amp;nbsp;disposal/recycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One factor that will impact the new contract is the price of material for recycling. This has collapsed as supply of &amp;#8216;recyclates&amp;#8217; has outpaced the demand for them, and sales of newspapers - an important source of demand for paper - have fallen dramatically in parallel with the rise of the&amp;nbsp;Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a contract of this size there is an obligation to go out to consultation. By the time you read this you should already have been invited to submit your comments. Watch out on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; social media sites for the link to an online survey. The consultation will seek the views of residents on how much they value the non-statutory services, such as collection of textiles, and whether they would value collection of batteries or Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (&amp;#8216;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WEEE&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;). It will seek to obtain a view on whether the current weekly collection from flats is justified, and whether or not a change to the commingling rules are needed (e.g. putting paper waste in the grey bins and getting rid of the blue boxes). There will also be questions on street&amp;nbsp;cleansing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey is due to run from 17th July until the 4th Sept. The evaluation of responses will be done in time for Cabinet to make a decision (jointly with East Herts &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt;) at its September or October meeting. The new contract will run from 9th May 2018, so the whole timetable is really very tight. It is very important to get this contract right as the scope to vary it once it has been signed will be&amp;nbsp;negligible.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>July Newsletter, published first in Knebworth Parish News</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/july-newsletter-published-first-in-knebworth-parish-news.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-07-04T20:49:10+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2017-07-04:/july-newsletter-published-first-in-knebworth-parish-news.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;July&amp;nbsp;Newsletter&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We have had a long period of elections, with the General Election following closely on the heels of the County elections. Stephen McPartland was re-elected as the Member of Parliament for Stevenage, which includes Knebworth, Codicote, Datchworth and Aston. Let us hope that Westminster MPs from all constituencies from across the country focus on the job in hand: which is to make the laws that will shape society in the country for years to come. A finely balanced parliament should help encourage more scrutiny of legislation, not least that which will arise as a result of the Brexit&amp;nbsp;negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the local level, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; carries on with the usual cycle of the Civic Year. As in all organisations, the finance function is at the heart of everything we do. The outturn of the revenue and capital budgets will be examined at the next cabinet meeting, as well as the annual treasury management review. These need to be completed before the budget cycle begins again, with the Corporate Plan and Medium Term Financial Strategy, which are due to be debated by Council on 31st August. The difference between the Council&amp;#8217;s projected income and its projected expenditure needs to be funded somehow. The amount is the &amp;#8216;precept&amp;#8217;, or the total amount of Council Tax collected. Note that the District Council also collects a precept for the county council, the police authority and, where a property is in a parished area, a parish council&amp;nbsp;precept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Community Facilities Capital Projects&amp;nbsp;Fund&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month I attended the first meeting of the panel which oversees the awarding of capital grants to Village and Community Halls in the District. It has been set up to dispense around one million pounds over the course of four years. The minimum award is &amp;pound;10,000 and the maximum &amp;pound;50,000. Projects themselves can be of any size. There were no applications from Knebworth at our first meeting, but one from the John Clements Centre in Codicote. Note that the panel is not decision making, and simply makes comments on the applications for consideration by the Strategic Director of Finance, Policy and Governance in consultation with the Executive Member for Community Engagement and Rural Affairs. To find out how to apply, contact me or search for &amp;#8216;Community Facilities Capital Projects Fund&amp;#8217; on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;website.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Local Plan Submission</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/local-plan-submission.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-06-16T14:34:30+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2017-06-16:/local-plan-submission.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Local Plan&amp;nbsp;Submission&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Following the meeting and resolutions of Full Council on 11 April 2017, the new Local Plan for North Hertfordshire has now been submitted to the Secretary of State for&amp;nbsp;examination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Planning Inspectorate have advised the Council that Inspector Simon Berkeley &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MRTPI&lt;/span&gt; has been appointed to conduct the examination. The precise date for the opening of any formal hearing part of the examination into the Local Plan will be decided by the&amp;nbsp;Inspector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louise St John Howe has been appointed as the Programme Officer for the duration of the examination. The Programme Officer is the independent ‘go between’ who liaises between the Inspector, the Council and the respondents to the plan. The Programme Officer will shortly write to everyone who responded to the last consultation on the Local Plan to advise them of the above and provide further&amp;nbsp;details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any queries regarding the administration of the examination or any correspondence for the attention of the Inspector should be sent via&amp;nbsp;Louise:&lt;/p&gt;

Luton airport is an important 
local employer, as well as a very important public transport hub for us all, but it does create some problems. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAA&lt;/span&gt; are keen to hear your&amp;nbsp;views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Letter from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Cllr&amp;nbsp;Hemingway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Civil Aviation Authority (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAA&lt;/span&gt;) is currently consulting on a new decision making process for all future airspace&amp;nbsp;changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This consultation ends on June&amp;nbsp;30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules, regulations and technology that underpin the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;’s airspace and network of flight paths have remained largely unchanged despite the growing increase in demand for air travel in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, London Luton’s ability to modify and improve flight paths is not only restricted by conflicts with routes from other London airports but also by a slow and inefficient airspace change&amp;nbsp;process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidance the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAA&lt;/span&gt; has drafted defines what will happen in the new process, including each stage a sponsor of an airspace change, such as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLA&lt;/span&gt; must complete; the stakeholders we must engage with at each stage and the expectations of that engagement; and how the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAA&lt;/span&gt; assesses proposed&amp;nbsp;changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London Luton Airport is submitting a formal response to the consultation. However, we believe it is vital that everyone has the opportunity to contribute to the process of airspace&amp;nbsp;modernisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of the consultation and how to respond can be found on the &lt;a href="https://consultations.caa.co.uk/policy-development/draft-airspace-design-guidance/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAA&lt;/span&gt;’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage all interested parties to take part before the deadline.
Whilst we can never eliminate aircraft noise entirely, we always aim to work constructively with local communities and our partners to strike the right balance between minimising the impact of aircraft noise while maximising the positive social and economic benefits of a successful&amp;nbsp;airport. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yours&amp;nbsp;sincerely &lt;/p&gt;

Richard Thake was re-elected to represent Knebworth, as well as Codicote, St Pauls Walden, Kimpton, Wymondley and St&amp;nbsp;Ippolyts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residents are often unclear about the difference between the County and District councils. The County Council runs social care, children&amp;#8217;s services (including schools) and the highways (other than motorways and trunk roads), and for Hertfordshire has a budget of around &amp;pound;1.85 billion, spending &amp;pound;1,625 per head of&amp;nbsp;population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The District Council has a budget of less than one percent of that of the county, around &amp;pound;16.6 million, with spend of &amp;pound;125 per head, so County spends approximately 13x as much per&amp;nbsp;capita.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the primary functions of the District Council is to act as the Planning Authority. This does affect us a lot - the reason I write about it here so often. It is important to understand the distinction between &lt;em&gt;Planning Policy&lt;/em&gt;: the production of the Local Plan; and &lt;em&gt;Planning Control&lt;/em&gt;: the process by which applications are development are checked against the appropriate local, and national, planning&amp;nbsp;policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inevitably, there is scope for developer and objector to disagree on exactly what they are permitted to build according to the policies in place. The District Council employs a team of planning officers, who are professionally qualified to interpret planning law. They determine routine applications under authority delegated from the Planning Control Committee. The bigger, or more contentious applications are examined by members of this committee, all of whom are elected&amp;nbsp;councillors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there seems to be a view that once a Plan is adopted, there is nothing further that residents can do to shape development, this is not the case. Individual applications will still have to be reviewed as part of the Planning Control process, which gives residents a say in what ends up being built. Objectors have been successful in blocking, or causing major modifications of several applications recently. Applications for solar farms on two Green Belt sites were refused or abandoned. Even if an application is granted, it may be possible for residents to make the grant subject to the developer taking prescribed actions. For example, he may be required to fund to local&amp;nbsp;infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March officers at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; finished cataloguing the 5,675 responses to the Local Plan consultation from last year. The role of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; in that consultation was only to collect and organize the responses, and to make sure the correct procedure was followed, as part of the overall, multi-stage process as set out by legislation that must be followed to arrive at a Local&amp;nbsp;Plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is the submission to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, for the plan to be reviewed by the government. In practice, the work is delegated to the Planning Inspectorate, with a named Planning Inspector responsible for undertaking the review. The review includes a Public Inquiry with the opportunity to provide oral evidence to the Planning&amp;nbsp;Inspector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Council decided at a special meeting on 11^th^ April to proceed with the submission. To be clear and help understand what was being asked at that meeting, the proposals within the plan themselves were not discussed nor voted on, solely the decision to submit to the Planning Inspector. I am happy to answer questions to the best that I can as the process is involved and quite complicated, largely determined by a legal&amp;nbsp;framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; will shortly deliver to the Inspector the full plan, plus the evidence base, plus all the responses to the last consultation forms the submission. Once the Inspector has reviewed the plan, the process moves to a Public Inquiry before the Inspector provides his report to the Secretary of State who has the final decision. As timings are confirm I will provide these, and the full timetable, updated from time to time, is available on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website - search for &amp;#8216;Local Development Scheme&amp;#8217;, which is what most of us call a&amp;nbsp;‘timetable’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hertfordshire County Council Elections – 4th&amp;nbsp;May&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voting in County elections takes place this year on Thursday, 4th May so if you are reading this early enough in May and registered to vote please take the opportunity to vote for your county council representative. Knebworth is within the Knebworth &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Codicote county electoral division which, as well as covering Knebworth and Codicote also covers Kimpton, Great and Little Wymondley and&amp;nbsp;Chesfield.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>April Newsletter</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/april-newsletter.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-03-28T12:31:34+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2017-03-28:/april-newsletter.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This article  appeared in the April edition of the Knebworth Parish&amp;nbsp;News.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Chas Lowe&amp;nbsp;Redevelopment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will be aware by now of proposals by McCarthy and Stone to re-develop the former Chas Lowe builders&amp;#8217; merchants site in London Road. I am not aware of any planning application yet, and so it is difficult to comment on proposals. A leaflet, which lacks details, has been delivered to residents.
What is clear is that distortions in the housing market have given rise to a situation where land for accommodation of the elderly has a higher value than almost any other. Knebworth, and North Herts generally has an ageing population. There is a need for this population to be housed. It is arguable that remaining in the larger properties they occupied when their children were young does not make a lot of sense. 
The other factor is that this sort of development can be built to a much higher density than other types, and needs to be provided with fewer parking places. Under the current plan, if the development is in &amp;#8216;Category 2&amp;#8217;, the requirement is for 0.35 places per dwelling. Category 2 accommodation is &lt;em&gt;in grouped flat-lets for the less active elderly people normally with a self contained warden&amp;#8217;s dwelling.&lt;/em&gt; This is much less than for other types of residential dwellings, and maximizes the return on a given size plot.
Knebworth residents have completed a questionnaire for the Neighbourhood Plan. This will reveal what type development village residents of Knebworth prefer. However, it is unlikely to be fully ready before a planning application is received.
The policies of the current Local Plan (Local Plan No. 2 with alterations, 1996) and the emerging Local Plan are similar, as far as development in what one might call town centre locations. Both seek to maintain shopping as the main activity in town centres, with permission for developments being given if retail use is preserved on the ground floor. This is my interpretation of the policies only: anyone interested would be advised to consult the Local Plan policies themselves. These are Policies 42 and 43 in the current Plan, and policy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETC6&lt;/span&gt; in the emerging Plan. The emerging Plan states that larger developments, of more than 500 square metres would not normally be considered&amp;nbsp;suitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;May&amp;nbsp;Elections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voting in County elections takes place this year on 4th May. Please make sure you are registered to vote.  If you need to register, or would like a postal vote, please contact &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; on 01462 474000 and ask for Democratic Services. It is also possible to register to vote on-line, although voting itself still requires the use of a pen (or pencil) and&amp;nbsp;paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Local Plan&amp;nbsp;Update&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officers at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; have been hard at work cataloguing the responses to the Local Plan consultation from last year. This process will be complete by the 23rd March. The Council will decide on submission of the Plan on a special meeting on the 11th April. The submission is to the Secretary of State  for Communities and Local Government, formally. In practice the work is delegated to the Planning Inspectorate. The full plan, plus the evidence base, plus all the responses to the last consultation forms the submission. This will be delivered to the Inspector shortly after the 11th April assuming that the Council decides to proceed with submission.  
Once the Inspector has reviewed the plan, the process moves to an examination in public. I will give further details in due course. The full timetable can be viewed on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website. Search for &amp;#8216;Local Development Scheme&amp;#8217;. This is, obviously, subject to&amp;nbsp;change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Knebworth Community&amp;nbsp;Chorus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to announce that Knebworth Community Chorus have received grants from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; and from the Knebworth Village Trust. This will provide them with staging and a new keyboard. The choir should now be fully equipped for its concert in the Village Hall on [insert date].

I have spent a lot of time in meetings, where people have said a lot of things. In some cases they have said the same things over and over but in many cases they have argued for the Council &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; things. In nearly ever case, the focus has been on the benefits of taking the action. The implicit subtext is that this clearly exceeds the cost.
Most politicians would, if pressed, concede that all actions have a reaction, and, in reality there are very few changes that leave everyone better off. The hope is that the costs are low, and spread widely, and will be offset by one or other of the other actions taken which, cumulatively, leave everyone better off.
This is not unreasonable. we discuss many policies which cost very little in financial terms. A grant of &amp;pound;1,000 will cost the average person in the District less than a penny. It seems obvious that the average person would simply never notice such a cost. The gratitude and clear benefits to the recipient are, however, very clear to the grant committee. The argument hardly needs to be made that the award is worthwhile. 
From an empathetic point of view, this is the right thing to do. But a quiet voice in my head keeps telling me that the resources that those 100,000 pennies represent have been diverted from what the producers of them would have chosen, to a charity that most of them have never heard of. Maybe if they had spent the time understanding the good work done by the organisers of this charity, they would have come to the same conclusion that we did. By examining the application, the constitution of the charity, the record of good work that it has done, we have saved countless hours of due diligence that could never have been justified if they were each considering dropping just a single penny in a collecting tin.
This is the argument made by Ronald Coase. That the practicalities of atomised decision making, are such that it makes eminent sense to delegate to a small group who can then arrange the joint purchase of services that in the absence of all the frictional forces operating in the real economy would have been impractical to agree.
The District Council collects household waste, and arranges for it to be disposed of. Every household may avail itself of this service. The cost is very modest. Private contractors would probably spring up if this service were not offered by the Council, and householders would, in most cases, sign up with one or other of the private contractors. Although I believe that capitalism is an incredibly efficient mechanism for supplying many goods and services, I acknowledge that it is very unlikely that households would save money. 
There are certainly problems with local or central governments providing services. One of the biggest is the difficulty in innovating, especially when consumers no longer have the incentive to adapt their own behaviours to enable more cost effective delivery.

The council faces challenging times ahead as it has to contend with dwindling revenues from the New Homes Bonus and from Business&amp;nbsp;Rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The council&amp;#8217;s focus is on making North Herts, in all its diversity, a better place for and working.  It aims to do this by working with partners to provide &amp;#8216;an attractive and safe environment for our residents&amp;#8217;. Currently, we are working towards a joint waste collection contract with East Herts District Council. Waste collection is not the most glamorous of activities, but it is the biggest item in the expenditure budget, accounting for 45% of the&amp;nbsp;total!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The council has an objective &amp;#8216; To promote sustainable growth within our district to ensure economic and social opportunities exist for our communities&amp;#8230;&amp;#8217;. The main driver of this is the Local Plan. It also includes a &amp;pound;1m Capital Enhancement Fund, for community halls throughout the District, to be delivered over the next four&amp;nbsp;years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third and final objective is to &amp;#8216;deliver cost effective and necessary services to our residents&amp;#8217;.  Where these services are charged for at the point of use, such as for planning applications, the fees are also prescribed centrally. However, the council does operate a very successful Careline service. This award-winning service helps elderly and infirm residents to continue living at home. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; is also about to launch a building regulations inspection service and hopes that this will be a source of&amp;nbsp;income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; does not have a free hand in most of the services it provides. They are so-called &amp;#8216;statutory services&amp;#8217;, prescribed by the national government. In most cases these are free, for example waste collection. Where charges can be made (e.g. planning applications), the rates are set&amp;nbsp;nationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more controversial policies recently has been the one which applies to community halls owned by the council. The policy has been to lease these to local groups on a &amp;#8216;repairing and insuring lease&amp;#8217;. This has put some pressure on some local groups who find that it is difficult to adapt to paying for the costs of maintaining their premises. It does, however, put them on an equal footing with groups in parished areas, like Knebworth. Parishes, such as ours, have always had to bear these costs, especially now capital grants for village halls have largely dried&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, by now you&amp;#8217;re probably wondering how much your council tax is going to go up in April. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; precept for a Band D property will be &amp;pound;216.96 next year, an increase of &amp;pound;5, an increase of 2.4% in cash terms, close to zero in real terms. Not great, but as low as was reasonably achieveable in the circumstances.  (The rest of your Council Tax is made up of contributions to the County Council, the Police and the Parish Council.) For other Council Tax Bands, see the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website, or just wait for your bill to be delivered.&lt;span id="header-c48" class="anchor"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Station Pub</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/station-pub.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-13T14:12:17+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2017-02-13:/station-pub.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The Station Pub, Knebworth,&amp;nbsp;Campaign&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;comments = true
tags: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;,&amp;nbsp;politics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience of the Station Pub in Knebworth is not one that makes me want to go back. The pub is cold, noisy and rarely populated by anyone I know. This is a pity, as it&amp;#8217;s a very short distance from where I live. A few months ago, word went out that it had been advertised for sale. There were a few discussions about it in the Parish Council, where we decided that we&amp;#8217;d better apply for it to be listed as an asset of community value. Planning applications to develop a very high density development of flats have been received for the site across the road, which have so far been refused, but eventually will result in some residential development happening. In spite of the fact that this is not something that anyone who lives in the village want to see built.
On Thursday, heard that the pub had closed its doors, and the staff had been redeployed in other Greene King pubs nearby. A flurry of activity happened, which resulted in:
* a new Twitter account was set up to tweet the latest news about the pub,
* a new Facebook being set up that rapidly went from zero to around 600 members by the end of the weekend,
* a new website being created, which has received hundreds of hits,
* a mailing list being set up to collect pledges and offers to help with a campaign.
You can see the website &lt;a href="https://www.stationpub.org.uk"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, where you&amp;#8217;ll find links to all the aspects of the campaign&amp;#8217;s web presence.
What is quite astonishing is how rapidly the residents of Knebworth could be alerted to the closing of the pub and the existence of a campaign to save it. I have always been an advocate of local politicians using social media, usually in the face of extreme skepticism from the assembled company. Although I&amp;#8217;d like to think that this example would persuade them of the effectiveness of the web, my experience is that people can be very obdurate in their&amp;nbsp;views.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth"></category></entry><entry><title>Community engagement using Facebook</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/community-engagement-using-facebook.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-10T15:28:49+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-17T10:26:39+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2017-02-10:/community-engagement-using-facebook.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Facebook and Saving&amp;nbsp;Pubs&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;The Station Pub,&amp;nbsp;Knebworth&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was contacted yesterday, in my capacity as ward councillor, about the closure of the Station Pub.
This is the only pub in the village, and, since it is right in the centre, was very visible.
I recommended creating a Facebook Group. I had a meeting, and someone else set up the group.
Today I found that hundreds had already joined, and a further three hundred were queing up to join today.
The rate of joining this group was astonishing. I am now convinced that mailing lists are comprehensively obsoleted by Facebook.
Some people do not use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FB&lt;/span&gt;, but the ease of adding someone to a group is so great that there is no other medium that can work so quickly. The problem is that this only works when the campaign is something that people are seriously affected by, or at least interested in. A cause that nobody cares about much will go&amp;nbsp;nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Is Twitter the key Social Media Platform?</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/is-twitter-the-key-social-media-platform.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-05T10:13:50+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-16T17:19:27+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2017-02-05:/is-twitter-the-key-social-media-platform.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Summary: Is using Twitter worth&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been on Twitter for a long time. Since 2007. From a time before Stephen Fry discovered the medium, and many years before Donald Trump did so. I&amp;#8217;ve mainly used it passively. I kept my account private, and followed only those authors whose work interested me. A lot of libertarian comment and analysis, some humour, especially the dark side. I have a number of followers, but get virtually no engagement with them. They are either people I follow, and feel that it is only good manners to follow back, or people who somehow have the email address linked to the account in the address book they have handed over to Twitter&amp;nbsp;Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I have never tweeted anything very incendiary, and do not follow anyone I wouldn&amp;#8217;t want my mother to know I was following, I decided that when I was elected I&amp;#8217;d better start a new account for the political me. This happened in 2014, and I&amp;#8217;ve been quietly tweeting since, without much&amp;nbsp;traction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, for reasons quite beyond me, my follower numbers seem to be accelerating. The threat to close the Station Pub seems a catalyst. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s just that my odd retweet is enough to create a sustaining wave. I confess to paying a magnificent &amp;pound;10 to promote one tweet, but I don&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;ll be doing that again in a hurry, as there seems to be no way to localize the audience, in contrast to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FB&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My twitter handle is&amp;nbsp;@steveknebworth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Update, 7&amp;nbsp;Dec.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;#8217;m still on Twitter, although I hate it as much as&amp;nbsp;ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t understand why $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TWTR&lt;/span&gt; is not more valuable: a product that is as difficult to stop buying as this should be worth bazillions.
Of course, I&amp;#8217;m not buying it: I&amp;#8217;m just (supposedly) helping a machine learning algorithm work out what is valuable to advertisers and what is&amp;nbsp;not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am probably too old to be of any interest to&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>More About the Station Pub</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/more-about-the-station-pub.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-01T11:43:51+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2017-02-01:/more-about-the-station-pub.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;February&amp;nbsp;Newsletter&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Station Pub is up for sale. The Parish Council is trying to raise funds to buy it for the community. See their article in this edition for more details. By the time you read this I hope that the pub will have been registered as an asset of community value at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;, which will give bidders time to raise funds. Technology has now multiplied the ways in which a large group of individuals can come together to finance a new venture. It will be difficult to raise the necessary funds, and to manage the business but as the only pub within walking distance of most of the residents of Knebworth I believe it is worth saving. North Herts District is home to the very first community owned pub in the country: the Red Lion at Preston, which continues to thrive thirty six years after being purchased by the&amp;nbsp;community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second of March is the date of the last meeting of the Southern Rural Committee for this Civic Year. This is the meeting where we are inclined to be most generous, as we like to spend our whole budget by the end of the year. To find out more, contact me, or Stuart Izzard, the Community Support Officer at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; for more details. Stuart can not only explain how best to go about applying for a grant from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;, but also advise on which other grant awarding bodies might be prepared to contribute. This applies to local community groups, sports clubs, choirs, charities etc. Groups which are specific to Knebworth may also apply to the Knebworth Village&amp;nbsp;Trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; have   vacancies in the Committee and Member Services, and the Housing and Homelessness teams. These are announced on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Twitter stream, so if you are looking for a job this is the place to look. They are also looking for an apprentice in Human Resources. All positions are in Letchworth. There are a number of personnel changes happening at the Council because of the programme of voluntary redundancies it has in&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Green Space Strategy has just been published. It is proposed to convert a number of play areas in the District back to green spaces because of the costs of maintaining and performing safety checks on the equipment. This does not affect Knebworth as all play equipment is paid for and maintained by the Parish Council using they money raised as a separate precept. Urban areas of the District are not &amp;#8216;parished&amp;#8217; and all funds for upkeep of recreation grounds and play equipment comes out of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; element of Council Tax, which is levied equally throughout the&amp;nbsp;District.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planning application for development of the Hamilton Billiards site was refused at the December meeting of the Planning Control Committee. The Chairman of the Parish Council, Roger Willcocks, and I spoke against the application. There were various grounds on which it was refused, with the fact that it is  out of character with the surrounding buildings and  having too little parking being two of the most important ones. A revised application is likely to be submitted, or, possibly, the applicant will appeal against the&amp;nbsp;decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A submission has been made as part of the Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan submission arguing that the  the site to the south of Gun Meadow Avenue and the north of Monread Lodge should not have been excluded from the plan. If the Planning Inspector accepts the submission and proposes an amendment to this plan to include this site, there will be an impact on Knebworth. The submission can be downloaded from the Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan Consultation&amp;nbsp;website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt; surgery moving to St Martin&amp;#8217;s Road the defibrillator on the wall of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt; surgery will be moving too. Fortunately, Knebworth Park Football Club have been provided with funds for a defibrillator, and associated costs. I will support it being fixed to the pavillion in the main recreation ground. These devices do save lives in a practical and direct&amp;nbsp;way.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>DECEMBER UPDATE</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/december-update.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-17T10:26:39+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2016-12-01:/december-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Rail Services from Knebworth - Timetable&amp;nbsp;Consultation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consultation has&amp;nbsp;finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consultation for the timetable for Govia Thameslink Railways is
on-going but will close at 17:00 on 8th December. The proposals
represent a significant change to the current service for Knebworth as
the stopping trains will now all come from Cambridge (rather than
alternately Cambridge and Peterborough), and become Thameslink services
going into St Pancras. Most significantly, this would mean Knebworth
would not benefit from the fast services as present, although there are
some suggestions that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTR&lt;/span&gt; have already had second thoughts about this.
Evenings and Saturday services may be significantly reduced and
proposals also suggest that Knebworth goes back to having only one train
per hour throughout the day on&amp;nbsp;Sundays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MP&lt;/span&gt;, Stephen McPartland, has made a formal response, available on his
website, and the Parish Council is actively preparing one, which should
be available on their website also. Full details on the proposals and
how to respond are on the Great Northern Thameslink website:
&lt;a href="http://www.thameslinkrailway.com/your-journey/timetable-consultation"&gt;http://www.thameslinkrailway.com/your-journey/timetable-consultation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;North Herts Leisure Centre and Council Offices&amp;nbsp;Refurbishment&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work is progressing on refurbishing the North Herts Leisure Centre in
Letchworth. Much of this work was essential to keep the facility
functioning safely, but a new pool and cafe are included in the works.
This centre, which is operated by Stevenage Leisure Ltd on behalf of the
council, produces revenue for the Council, which will go up under the
agreed contractual arrangements once the work is&amp;nbsp;complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project to refurbish the Council Offices will soon be underway. It
is expected that the work will start in the next month or so, and that
staff will be relocated to other offices around the area. The work is
being project managed by local firm, Wilmott Dixon. All staff will be
&amp;#8216;decanted&amp;#8217; from the existing District Council Offices to Town Lodge over
the course of this month. Town Lodge is also in Gernon Road, but
opposite the Broadway&amp;nbsp;Cinema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Planning&amp;nbsp;Portal&lt;/h1&gt;

system. This will continue to be supplied by Idox &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLC&lt;/span&gt;., the current

&lt;p&gt;to end&amp;nbsp;November &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The local public meeting ahead of the Parish Council meeting went ahead
as planned on Wednesday 12th October. The hall was full, with many of
those attending having to stand. The only occasion I can recall coming
close to this level of attendance was the meeting to discuss the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;
Preferred Options, in the fourth quarter of&amp;nbsp;2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Ward delivered an excellent summary of the Local Plan process. This
set the context and enabled members of the public to understand better
how they could participate effectively in the Local Plan consultation
process. Both of your District Councillors were present, and did their
best to answer the questions addressed to&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Parish Council, in its regular meeting after the public meeting,
decided to allocate a budget to cover the cost of a planning consultant
to help it produce its response to the Local Plan consultation which
started on the 19th October and will run until the end of November. All
residents are encouraged to read the Plan, which will be available in
the Library, and online, and to submit their representations. A new
improved online system for recording representations will be accessible
via the District Council&amp;#8217;s website, or an email to
localplan@north-herts.gov.uk, or a letter to Planning Policy, Local Plan
Consultation, North Hertfordshire District Council, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PO&lt;/span&gt; Box 480, M33 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;0DE&lt;/span&gt;.
Please ensure that you make it very clear which section of the Plan your
representation relates to. As I have explained previously, these
representations will be collated by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; and submitted to the Planning
Inspector ahead of the Public Enquiry, which is currently expected to
take place in the second quarter of&amp;nbsp;2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Revised Grants&amp;nbsp;Policy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revised Grants Policy, now adopted, has reduced the total amount of
money available for grants from the Council, and restricted the groups
which are eligible. One of the big changes is that &amp;#8216;precepting bodies&amp;#8217;,
such as Parish Councils are not allowed to ask &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; for grants. The
basis for this is that they already have the power to raise money from
local residents via Council Tax. Historically, parish councils have been
a big recipient of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Grants, so even with a reduced budget there is
an opportunity for local community groups to obtain funding. The
grant-awarding committee which covers Knebworth, Codicote and other
southern parishes is Southern Rural. It still has a budget of around
&amp;pound;18,000 to spend by the end of the Civic Year, so now is the time to
write your applications ready for the next committee meeting, which is
on 1st&amp;nbsp;December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that there is a separate committee which overseas capital grants
for village halls, community halls and the like. This is the Community
Facilities Capital Projects Fund. The current four-year programme has
one million pounds to disburse for capital projects. Parish councils are
permitted to apply for capital funding from this&amp;nbsp;fund.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>OCTOBER UPDATE</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/october-update.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-10-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-17T10:26:39+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2016-10-01:/october-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Draft Local&amp;nbsp;Plan&lt;/h1&gt;

Local Plan is approved the pattern of development in North Herts will be
set for a&amp;nbsp;generation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the draft plan is available on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website, but minor
changes are still being made, so it is not possible to give any links
here. Please check the website itself, and social media for the latest&amp;nbsp;updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications of Local Plan for Knebworth:&lt;/strong&gt; There are several sites
proposed for Knebworth, see map, one in the centre of the village and
the rest for removal from the Green Belt, with dwelling estimates (area
based rule of thumb, not developer proposal) totalling 791, as&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why is this consultation&amp;nbsp;different:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you are probably suffering from &amp;#8216;consultation fatigue&amp;#8217;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; have consulted repeatedly on aspects of the local plan, which is not surprising since it was supposed to be ready by 2011. The most recent consultation, on the so-called &lt;em&gt;Preferred Options&lt;/em&gt; was in December 2014 and generated about eight and a half thousand responses from around the District, including a several hundred from&amp;nbsp;Knebworth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This consultation is different because the responses will be examined by
the Planning Inspector and will feed into the public enquiry where the
Local Plan will finally be adopted (or not). &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; will simply collate
the responses and pass them to the Inspector. Responses may be
electronic or on paper, but not by telephone or in&amp;nbsp;person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that, if you submitted comments in response to previous
consultations on the plan and believe that the updated plan does not
fully address your concerns, you should submit your comments so that
they will be received by the Planning&amp;nbsp;Inspector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Soundness of Local&amp;nbsp;Plan:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Planning Inspector will examine the Draft Local Plan to determine whether it is ‘sound’. A plan is sound if it is ‘&lt;em&gt;Positively prepared&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Justified&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Effective&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Consistent with national policy&lt;/em&gt;.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Positive&amp;nbsp;Preparation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This requires that the plan provides for enough
houses, business premises, infrastructure and community facilities. It
also requires that the plan is &lt;em&gt;sustainable&lt;/em&gt;, in the sense that it does
not cause irreversible damage to the environment or the well-being of
future generations. Although developers are expected, in principle, to
pay for infrastructure, there is a requirement that the plan defines
what infrastructure is needed. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; take the view that no account may be
taken of &amp;#8216;Brexit&amp;#8217; because it is too early to estimate its effects on
housing&amp;nbsp;numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Justified&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is &lt;strong&gt;justified&lt;/strong&gt; only if it is based on compelling evidence and
that evidence is presented alongside the plan itself. The submitted
draft must be the best of all possible choices. Other choices for the
plan, such as the suggestion that has been made for a &amp;#8216;New Garden City&amp;#8217;,
must be demonstrated to be inferior to the choices in the&amp;nbsp;plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Effective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is &lt;strong&gt;effective&lt;/strong&gt; if it can be implemented within the available
timescale (before 2031). If the plan does not mesh with those of
neighbouring authorities, or the infrastructure required to support it
cannot be built, the plan will fail the effectiveness test. The draft
submission plan calls for around 1,100 house completions a year to be
delivered for the latter of the plan period. This is considerably more
than North Herts has previously&amp;nbsp;achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Consistent with national&amp;nbsp;policy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan must be &lt;strong&gt;consistent with national policy&lt;/strong&gt;. A policy that many
local residents have commented on is the need to avoid changing Green
Belt boundaries, except under exceptional circumstances. Available
sustainable brownfield sites in the District are limited and the vast
bulk of land allocated for proposed housing is on sites which are
currently in the Green Belt. There are many polices in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPPF&lt;/span&gt; (and the
associated Planning Practice Guidance website): I suggest that residents
consider whether or not the Plan is consistent with the whole of the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPPF&lt;/span&gt;, and not just the paragraph relating to the Green&amp;nbsp;Belt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Timings:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Cabinet is scheduled to meet on 26th September to approve the current version of the plan to go forward to consultation. It will then become the &amp;#8216;draft submission plan&amp;#8217;. If it is approved, the officers will prepare the material for consultation, and set up the consultation software on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website. Readers will be pleased to hear that new, improved software is being used this time, so the frustrations which the experienced trying to make representations on the Preferred Options draft &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be a thing of the&amp;nbsp;past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all goes according to plan the &lt;strong&gt;consultation period will run from the 19th October to the 30th November&lt;/strong&gt;. Again, this period will run over the Christmas holidays, and potentially means that some residents will have a very short window in which to read the documents and make their&amp;nbsp;submissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the end of the consultation period, the submissions will be categorised by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; and submitted together with the Draft Plan and all other supporting material to the Planning Inspector in the first part of&amp;nbsp;2017.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>SEPTEMBER UPDATE</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/september-update.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-09-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-17T10:26:39+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2016-09-01:/september-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Draft Local&amp;nbsp;Plan&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update on Process:&lt;/strong&gt; Last month I highlighted the extraordinary
meeting of the Council to endorse the proposed emerging (or draft) Local

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update on Process:&lt;/strong&gt; Last month I highlighted the extraordinary
meeting of the Council to endorse the proposed emerging (or draft) Local
Plan. It was the only topic on the agenda and the meeting heard public
participation from a number of groups, almost exclusively speaking
against the proposals. The council heard a presentation from the
Executive Member for Planning, and then a prolonged debate involving
most of the council. The resolution to endorse the draft plan was
supported by 32 votes, with 12 voting against or abstaining (which
included&amp;nbsp;me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications of Local Plan for Knebworth:&lt;/strong&gt; There are several sites
proposed for Knebworth, one in the centre of the village and the rest
for removal from the Green Belt, with dwelling estimates (area based

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A map of the sites is available, and you can find out more by searching
for “draft emerging allocations Knebworth”, with information on the
Parish Council and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; websites. The full detail of the Emerging Local
Plan may be obtained from:&amp;nbsp;www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/planning/planning-policy/emerging-local-plan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Steps and Timings:&lt;/strong&gt; The next step is for a final decision by the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Cabinet to submit the plan for public consultation which, in this
context, is collecting responses for review by the Planning Inspector,
on behalf of the Secretary of&amp;nbsp;State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision by Cabinet will be taken at a meeting in September, so that
the statutory period of 6 weeks for the consultation will begin sometime
around mid October, so there is time to examine the proposals so that
you are ready to submit any comments once the consultation&amp;nbsp;begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that, if you submitted comments in response to previous
consultations on the plan, such as the Preferred Options consultation in
December 2014, and believe that the updated plan does not fully address
your concerns, you should submit your comments again in October. This
time the comments will be examined by the Planning Inspector, on behalf
of the Secretary of State, and not by the planning officers in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;, as
part of his review of the whole plan. It is expected that formal
submission to the Planning Inspector will happen in the first part of
2017 and approval of the plan will be some time after that, possibly not
until&amp;nbsp;2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Joint Waste Collection and Street Cleaning&amp;nbsp;Contract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A contract for waste collection and street cleansing in the District is
not the most exciting topic imaginable. However, it does account for
around 45% of all North Herts District expenditure, so getting it wrong
could have catastrophic consequences for the Council budget. It has been
decided to go out to tender jointly with East Herts as by doing this
there will be an elimination of duplication in management of the
contract and should result in a reduction in unit costs. Before we can
do this the contract specifications for North and East Herts have to be
brought into line: not least the termination date of our current
contracts, but also in some detailed aspects of waste and recycling. To
let the contract will therefore take quite some time, but the decision
has now been made to move forward with the tender&amp;nbsp;process.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>AUGUST UPDATE</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/august-update.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-08-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-17T10:26:39+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2016-08-01:/august-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parking in Knebworth:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Councillor Julian Cunningham, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; executive member with responsibility for parking policy, attended the Parish Council meeting in July.

Cllr Cunningham ran through the Council’s current parking policy and confirmed that the underlying principles were unlikely to change in the new policy which is about to be&amp;nbsp;developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residents at the meeting raised a number of issues, including hazardous parking on the east of London Road, south of Knebworth School, around the Gun Road/Gun Lane junction and along Hornbeam Spring, to mention just three of a considerable number of places of concern around the&amp;nbsp;village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gun Lane had been previously identified as likely to benefit from extending some of the existing double yellow lines. Our county councillor, Richard Thake was also present, which was useful as Herts &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt; and the Herts Constabulary are consultees in matters of road&amp;nbsp;safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Draft Local Plan:&lt;/strong&gt; As I write there is a week to go before an extraordinary meeting of the Council to consider a draft Local Plan. If that Council meeting endorses the plan, it will be taken forward the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Cabinet meeting in September as, under the council’s constitution, Cabinet has the ultimate responsibility for approving the final draft for submission for examination by the government appointed Planning&amp;nbsp;Inspectorate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that Cabinet approve the plan, public consultation will commence shortly thereafter, with a statutory six-week period. At this stage of the process the Council collates responses and submits them for examination by the Inspector, together with all associated supporting information relating to the draft&amp;nbsp;plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find detailed information on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website at this address:&amp;nbsp;www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/planning/planning-policy/emerging-local-plan/proposed-submission-local-plan-2011-2031&lt;/p&gt;

Herts &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CC&lt;/span&gt;, who are the responsible body for flood plans, explained that it was important that any changes did not increase the possibility of flooding further into the village, and thereby put properties at risk, and undertook to provide a summary of the&amp;nbsp;issues. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>JULY UPDATE</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/july-update.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-07-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-17T10:26:39+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2016-07-01:/july-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Grants Policy:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; awards grants every year of around half a

a revised grants policy was approved by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Cabinet on
14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; June. The revised policy puts some more stringent
requirements on bodies applying for grants, with recommendations that:
‘precepting bodies&amp;#8217; (i.e. parish councils) be no longer eligible to
apply for grants, no more than grant will be awarded to a body in any
one year, and no grant will be given where a body has been awarded a
grant in two consecutive years. Southern Rural, along with the other
area committees, will suffer an approximately 50% drop in the funds
available for&amp;nbsp;grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is recognized that parishes such as Knebworth may have difficulty
raising funds for capital projects so a new capital funding scheme has
been proposed which is designed to help both rural and urban capital
projects. The idea is that village and community halls can be helped out
when they have larger capital spending needs. The proposal is to make
available a quarter of a million pounds&amp;nbsp;annually.&lt;/p&gt;

Councillor Julian Cunningham will be attending the Parish Council
meeting on 13 July at 8pm. He is the Executive Member (i.e. member of
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Cabinet) with responsibility for parking policy. An hour at the
beginning of the meeting has been set aside to discuss parking problems
in the&amp;nbsp;village.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Draft Local Plan – meeting on 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; July:&lt;/strong&gt; On 20th
July there will be an extraordinary meeting of the Council to approve a
draft Local Plan; as with other Council meetings this meeting is open to
the public. The plan will be scrutinized by a planning inspector at a
public enquiry, probably in&amp;nbsp;2017.&lt;/p&gt;

June the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Cabinet approved the Neighbourhood Plan Area for Knebworth

&lt;p&gt;Following the local election for one of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; seats for Knebworth
ward in May, Steve Deakin-Davies was elected as a councillor. Steve
enjoys living in Knebworth together with his partner and children, and
has lived here for over 14 years having lived nearby previously for a
similar length of time. Steve had previously been a Parish Councillor,
and has been involved in a wide range of community activities, most
recently with the Knebworth Festival when he ran a video and live
performance night showcasing local talent. Steve is interested in
helping young people get a start in life as entrepreneurs, and works as
a lecturer and mentor at the University of Hertfordshire, helping set up
and develop a range of businesses. Steve also has an interest in health
matters, and previously work as a nurse at the Lister&amp;nbsp;Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; New Civic&amp;nbsp;Year&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The civic year for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; runs from May, following the local elections in
Knebworth ward and a number of other &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; seats. The new council will
therefore have a different composition to the year just&amp;nbsp;ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Annual Meeting of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Council on 19th May is the first meeting
of the new year, and includes appointment onto the various committees
that make up the District Council, and the chairs and vice-chairs of the
committee. Both Steve Deakin-Davies and I will be on the Southern Rural
Committee, as this is the one that deals with matters relating to the
villages in the south of the district, and will advise on which other(s)
we will individually be on next month once the annual meeting has been&amp;nbsp;held.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June will be a month with many activities, including the Knebworth
Festival, and I am looking forward to going along to some of the events
and will no doubt see some of you&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>MAY UPDATE</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/may-update.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-05-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-17T10:26:39+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2016-05-01:/may-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Emerging Local&amp;nbsp;Plan&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of producing the new Local Plan for the North Herts District
is progressing. The record number of over 8,000 responses to the
Preferred Options consultation last year has meant that, despite long
hours of work from the Planning Policy Officers, the consideration of
the comments will take until the summer and Consultation on the Proposed
Submission to the Secretary of State will follow thereafter. The formal
submission is expected to be made in March 2017 according to the current
timetable (Local Development&amp;nbsp;Scheme).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been some suggestions that there will be a substantial
increase in the housing allocation numbers in the Emerging Local Plan.
It is the case that recent revised &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ONS&lt;/span&gt; figures suggest an increase, and
it is also the case that the National Planning Policy Framework suggests
that sites are identified in excess of the actual need to allow for some
flexibility. It is expected that there will be more clarity on this in
the next&amp;nbsp;weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the Consultation, a number of new sites have been put forward
for review by the officers. They are in the process of being evaluated
against exactly the same criteria that were used to select the sites
that were included in the Preferred Options consultation. In Knebworth
itself, three additional sites have been put forward for consideration
for inclusion in the Local Plan – see
http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/planning/planning-policy/local-plan-emerging-policy/draft-local-plan-2011-2031/local-plan-preferred
(click on the text which reads &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/sites/northherts-cms/files/Composite%20document%202.pdf"&gt;New sites 2015 (additional sites
submitted
since 2013)&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;).
All are currently in the Green Belt, so this is, essentially, a
suggestion that they be taken out of the Green Belt. On the document
titled &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Local Plan - New Sites 2015&amp;#8221; these sites are numbered 334,
335 and 336. They are Cnebba&amp;#8217;s Field, Old Knebworth, the land to the
rear of Redwoods in Deards End Lane, and land east of Old Knebworth
lane. The three sites would comprise 79 potential dwellings in all, but
&lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; if the sites are found to have met the criteria for inclusion. No
decision on this have yet been&amp;nbsp;made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Knebworth &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Surgery&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am regularly asked about the status of the new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt; surgery. As I
understand it, a planning application is due to be made this month,
assuming that the new arrangements for the Library are confirmed by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HCC&lt;/span&gt;
in a cabinet meeting scheduled for 28&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; April. I understand
the impatience that people feel about this, but emphasise that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; is
not responsible for the&amp;nbsp;delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Thank you to retiring Councillor Alan&amp;nbsp;Bardett&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After serving as a District Councillor for over 14 years, Alan Bardett
has decided to retire and therefore not seek re-election in this year’s
elections. I would like to offer my great thanks to Alan for showing me
the ropes and giving me advice when I was a new councillor only two
years ago, as well as for all his efforts on behalf of our village over
the many years of&amp;nbsp;service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Annual Parish Meeting – Wednesday, 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; May&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the full North Herts District Council meeting on 11 Feb the Executive
Member for Finance, Terry Hone, presented his budget for next year (Apr
2016 – Mar 2017) for the District, later than usual as central
government took a long while to decide on the financial settlement for
local councils. The settlement for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; is &amp;pound;871,000 of Revenue Support
Grant for next year and after that zero, i.e. from April 2017 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;’s
expenditure (net of income received) has to be provided 100% by local
Council Tax Payers. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; is one of only 15 local authorities in England
to be facing a zero revenue support grant, which reflects the relative
prosperity of the residents of North Herts. However, as a result of the
response to the consultation on the financial settlement to local
authorities’ additional central government funding has been provided. A
so-called Transition Grant has been awarded to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; to ease the move to
zero &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSG&lt;/span&gt;. This amounts to &amp;pound;285,000 in total and will be received over
the next two civic&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The budget for 2016/17 results in the District component of Council Tax
being set at the equivalent of &amp;pound;211.96 for a Band D property, an
increase of 1.9% over the current year. For a Band D property, the
charge for the cost of services provided by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; is therefore 58p per
day, or just over &amp;pound;4 per week; the increase is only 1.1p per day. The
recommendation to adopt the budget received all party support at the
council&amp;nbsp;meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, your Council Tax bill includes elements to fund services
provided by the County Council, the Police and the Parish Council, so
your total Council Tax bill will be considerably&amp;nbsp;greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;District-Wide&amp;nbsp;Survey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; seeks to understand people’s satisfaction with the Council and its
services. A North Herts District Wide Survey is a consultation exercise
that takes place every two years. The survey consists of approximately
1,000 residents from across North Hertfordshire who are consulted via
telephone interviews. These interviews are carried out by independent&amp;nbsp;consultants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent survey was carried out in October and November last
year. The report from this survey is expected to be presented to Cabinet
next month, and will be available on the website from about&amp;nbsp;mid-March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the District-Wide Survey new members of the Citizen’s Panel
are selected. This is a group of residents who are regularly contacted
about their views on Council performance, so that trends in satisfaction
levels can be tracked on a more frequent basis than every two&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>FEBRUARY UPDATE</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/february-update.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-02-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-17T10:26:39+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2016-02-01:/february-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Flooding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;December and January have seen extremely heavy rain falling, seemingly
without respite. The consequences are that the gullies around the
village have struggled to take the flow, and we have come perilously
close to the flooding that was experienced in Orchard Way/Broom Grove a
couple of years ago. Unfortunately a number of the graves in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;
Cemetery in Wadnall Way have been temporarily submerged. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; is aware
of the problem and have taken steps to inspect the site with, as yet, no
solution&amp;nbsp;proposed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Council&amp;nbsp;Tax&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; financial team are busy preparing a final budget for 2016-17.
There are a number of uncertainties around the amount of money available
from central taxation: the so called ‘Revenue Support Grant’. A number
of decisions around this are scheduled to be made at Cabinet this month.
It is likely that more efficiency savings will be&amp;nbsp;made.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Syrian&amp;nbsp;Refugees&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Cabinet decided in December that Syrian refugees Hertfordshire
will be welcomed under the terms of a resettlement scheme recommended by
the Home Office if they decide to come to North Herts. Full council
voted, in November, to indicate to the Home Office that the District
would be interested in helping fifty refugees to resettle here, in
family groups, over the next five years, a total of ten individuals per
year, possibly three or four families. The national scheme includes
financial assistance to local authorities prepared to welcome refugees,
who will be transported to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; directly from camps in Syria or
immediately neighbouring&amp;nbsp;countries.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>January 2016</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/january-2016.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-01-01T15:26:52+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2016-01-01:/january-2016.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;January Newsletter&amp;nbsp;2016&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Application to redevelop the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt; Surgery at 1 Stevenage&amp;nbsp;Road&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiations are continuing to find a better building for the Knebworth and Marymead Medical Practice. I have had meetings with Stephen McPartland and Richard Thake to establish how to move forward on this problem. The owner of the existing surgery had submitted a planning application to redevelop the site, although this has now been withdrawn. The site currently occupied by Knebworth Library in St Martins Road is currently the preferred location. Plans have been produced to redevelop this site to become a building which can house both the library and the&amp;nbsp;surgery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Pondcroft Road, Milestone Road, Gun Lane Draft Traffic Regulation&amp;nbsp;Order&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended a meeting with Transport Officers at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; on 17th November. Both Cllr. Richard Thake and Cllr. Julian Cunningham, portfolio holder for Transport were present. We discussed preliminary proposals to further restrict parking on Watton Road and also a Traffic Regulation Order to create a Controlled Parking Zone (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPZ&lt;/span&gt;) covering Milestone Road and Pondcroft Road, which currently suffer from parking by commuters and both visitors and employees using the shops and offices in London Road.
Our decision was to leave the parking arrangements in Watton Road unchanged, as there was too little support for the proposed changes, and to introduce the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPZ&lt;/span&gt;. A number of recommendations on relatively minor amendments to double yellow line positions in Station Road and Deanscroft were also&amp;nbsp;accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Norton Green&amp;nbsp;Common&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to report that Knebworth Parish Council has entered into a Stewardship Agreement with Natural England for the management of Norton Green Common. This agreement comes with over seven hundred pounds of grants from Natural England to restore the Common to a good condition. However the work needs to be done and the subcommittee are looking for volunteers to do it! It is planned to hold a stall at the Christmas Fete to attract interest. It is hoped that two days of will be organised in the New Year when volunteers will be invited to work on clearance of the Common. For more information please contact the Clerk of the Parish Council. In addition to the grant from Natural England, now the Common is registered it is eligible for payments from the Rural Payments Agency. This would not have been possible without a lot of hard work on the part of Rosemary Pateman, Karen Robinson and the&amp;nbsp;Clerk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Local&amp;nbsp;Plan&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a fairly tempestuous &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; council meeting in the sports hall at the North Herts Leisure Centre in Letchworth, where over three hundred members of the public turned up, the council decided to agree to go to consultation on the current draft of the Local Plan. This plan is intended to shape development in the district up until 2031 (and in reality at least five years beyond this date). It is the biggest change to planning in the district since 1996. The plan includes forty two documents specifying policies on all aspects of development, and represents a huge effort on the part of the planning policy officers and the portfolio holder, David Levett. It includes a &amp;#8216;Preferred Options&amp;#8217; document which list the sites which are most suitable for development, and therefore, in many cases, are proposed to be removed from the Green Belt. These sites include two which are in Knebworth, providing space for 411 homes and a new primary&amp;nbsp;school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is available online on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website, and at Knebworth Library. The consultation period will have already started by the time you read this, and will continue until the first week of February. The Parish Council is a statutory consultee in this process, and will welcome your views. You may also send them direct to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Planning Policy: just go to the &amp;#8216;Current Policy and Projects Consultations&amp;#8217; page.
The consultation process is a part of local democracy, and this is an important opportunity for you to have your say. I strongly encourage you to take part. I will ensure that any emails or letters I receive will be fed into the consultation&amp;nbsp;process. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>November</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/november.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-11-01T15:26:52+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2015-11-01:/november.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;November Newsletter&amp;nbsp;2015&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOVEMBER&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPDATE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Noise&amp;nbsp;Application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; has introduced a Noise App to help deal with noise&amp;nbsp;nuisance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North Hertfordshire District Council is using new technology to help deal with noise nuisance and has introduced a new Noise App. The app created by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RH&lt;/span&gt; Environmental, allows residents with mobile devices to record incidents of nuisance noise and submit them to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; via the app. As unwanted noise is captured when it is actually happening, this makes it easier for residents to report problems and will allow the Council to more effectively investigate noise nuisance cases. Recorded audio files, which are sent securely, can also be shared with the Police and other agencies when tackling cases of anti-social&amp;nbsp;behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app can be downloaded free from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website: &lt;a href="http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/environmental-health/pollution/noise-app"&gt;http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/environmental-health/pollution/noise-app&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Schedule of&amp;nbsp;Meetings&lt;/h2&gt;

The meetings are held at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;’s offices in Gernon Road, Letchworth, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SG6&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;3JF&lt;/span&gt; and are open for members of the public to observe; this includes the meetings of the Council’s&amp;nbsp;Cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; – In the Summer &lt;strong&gt;time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; full council meetings are not scheduled during school holidays to make it easier for those with school age children to stand as councillors. There are some exceptions, with the Standards Committee meeting in August (see below), and planning applications continue to be considered because of strict deadlines on the time allowed for the council to process these. Generally, the routine work of the council via the officers and staff continues ensuring that services are not interrupted, while a range of extra activities, particularly aimed at children, are run at the leisure centres and other venues through the district.
&lt;span id="post-office-opening" class="anchor"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Planning Code of Conduct&lt;/strong&gt;
A draft of an updated Code of Conduct for Councillors was reviewed on 12&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; August by the Standards Committee of which I am a member. The code makes it clear that it is essential for all members to avoid any suggestion of bias in respect of local planning applications. Many decisions are taken by the Planning Control Committee, while in some circumstances the case may be decided by a full Council Meeting, or on rare occasions be referred to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. This will not affect my ability, as District Councillor for Knebworth ward, to speak as member advocate for matters that affect&amp;nbsp;Knebworth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Three Houses Lane Solar Farm “Called&amp;nbsp;In”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Secretary of State for the Department for Communities and Local Government has “called in” the application for a solar farm in Three Houses Lane and confirmed that an inquiry will be held under Section 77 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. The situation is analogous to that of the application at Swangleys Lane and it is to be expected that the decision on the latter will be very significant for the Three Houses Lane application.

&lt;h2&gt;Neighbourhood Plan Working Party – Any more&amp;nbsp;volunteers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have one additional offer of help towards producing a Neighbourhood Plan for all (or part of) Knebworth Parish so we are still on track to convene an inaugural meeting in the Autumn.

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; – Council Business&amp;nbsp;Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Council Meeting on 21 July covered a range of important issues, many of which will have an effect on North Hertfordshire residents long after the current Civic Year:
-   The Council is preparing to respond to recent legislation to take into account Social Value in its tendering processes. This should make it easier for local businesses to sell goods and services to the Council
-   A report was accepted on the refurbishment of the North Herts Leisure Centre at Letchworth, costing in excess of &amp;pound;3 million, which should result in significantly improved facilities there
-   The &amp;#8216;Corporate Objectives&amp;#8217; which sets goals and priorities for the district until 2021, centred around &lt;em&gt;Promoting Sustainable Growth&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Working with Communities&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Living Within Our Means&lt;/em&gt;
-   Reports on projects such as Churchgate, Hitchin, and the North Herts Museum and Community Facility at Hitchin Town Hall, and from the Finance Officers
Knebworth Post Office – New Look and Longer Opening Hours
=========================================================
I was honoured to open officially the new-look Post Office in St Martin&amp;#8217;s Road, Knebworth. The branch has undergone a major refurbishment and upgrade of the old post office, which has remained largely unchanged from a time before I moved to Knebworth in 1985. It will now open for longer hours, until 6pm on weekday evenings and until 5.30pm on Saturdays, so giving more time for residents to pick up un-delivered parcels and generally use the services without the need to go further afield.
Knebworth Post Office also now has a new Postmaster, with Mohammad Miah recently taking over from Nicola Low, who had held the position for the last thirty&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Neighbourhood Plan Working Party – Interested in being&amp;nbsp;Involved?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a small number of volunteers offering to get involved in examining the feasibility of developing a Neighbourhood Plan for all (or part of) Knebworth Parish. If you would like to get involved, especially if you have any professional expertise or involvement with Planning legislation, then please get in touch with me using the contact details below.
If there is sufficient support I hope to convene an inaugural meeting in the Autumn and would expect to work extremely closely with the Parish Council on development of any Neighbourhood&amp;nbsp;Plan.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>July</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/july.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-07-01T15:26:52+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-17T10:26:39+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2015-07-01:/july.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;July Newsletter 2015&amp;#8221;modified:&amp;nbsp;2020-05-09&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; - New Council&amp;nbsp;Appointment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first meeting has been held and the appointments of Chairs, Vice-Chairs and members of the various committees made. As well as being a member of the Southern Rural Committee, I have been appointed as the Vice-Chairman of the Overview and Scrutiny Committee. The function of this committee is to &amp;#8216;hold the executive to account&amp;#8217;. To this end we examine many performance statistics and call each portfolio holders to present a report to us once per year. We occasionally have meetings devoted to specific, usually large, projects that we consider require close scrutiny: e.g. last year a meeting was devoted to examining the redevelopment of Hitchin Town&amp;nbsp;Hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Grants available through the Southern Rural&amp;nbsp;Committee&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; has limited funds, but does make grants to local organisations, as long as they are independent, not-for-profit and work for the benefit of the local community. Currently there is a Community Building Refurbishment Fund which has &amp;pound;15,000 available, and a Playground Fund and an Environmental Improvement Fund each with &amp;pound;10,000 available. With the exception of the Environmental Improvement Fund, community groups will be expected to raise at least 50% themselves. For further details see http://www.north-herts.gov.uk/home/community/grants or call 01462 474000 and ask for the Community Services Team.
Grant applications for Knebworth groups will be reviewed by the Southern Rural Committee, which meets four times a year. In our meeting on 11 June the committee approved &amp;pound;250 towards the cost of installing new pedestrian handrails on the steps to the footpath from New Close to Stevenage Road, and &amp;pound;200 towards the cost of developing the new Parish Council Website. Grant applications must be completed in good time before we meet, and may be submitted on paper or filled in online. The deadline for submissions for the next meeting in September is early&amp;nbsp;August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stevenage Borough Council – Consultation on Local Plan&amp;nbsp;2011-2031&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the development of the Stevenage Borough Local Plan 2011-2031, Stevenage Borough Council is undertaking a public consultation on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SBC&lt;/span&gt;’s preferred housing target for the Borough which is increased to 7,600 homes. Their preferred approach would roll-back the Green Belt within &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SBC&lt;/span&gt; and for needs beyond 2031 would wish to work with neighbouring councils to review the Green Boundary. The consultation on this aspect of the Emerging Local Plan runs from 22&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; June to 27 July 2015 and further information and how to submit a response can be found on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SBC&lt;/span&gt;’s website under Planning Policy:&amp;nbsp;http://www.stevenage.gov.uk/planning/planning-policy/&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>June 2015</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/june-2015.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-06-01T15:26:52+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-17T10:26:39+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2015-06-01:/june-2015.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;June Newsletter 2015&amp;#8221;modified:&amp;nbsp;2020-05-09&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;June 2015&amp;nbsp;Newsletter&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Annual Meeting of the Parish on Wednesday the 6th of May, where
parking in Knebworth was one of the more burning issues under
discussion. Opinion in the village is sharply divided between those who
welcome the increased space available for shoppers, and those who worry
about availability of parking spaces for those who work in the village,
and those whose vehicles need to be near their place of work. I am in
discussion with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; to see if the balance between the needs of
residents and local businesses can be improved.
Parking as a wider issue in the village has not disappeared from the
agenda. I am trying to revive &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KPIG&lt;/span&gt;, the Knebworth Parking Initiative
Group, but I will have to wait until the portfolio holder for transport
is announced before I can make much more progress with this. Fairly
extensive changes have been made to parking in the village, and the
District is reluctant to deploy resources to change things even more,
unless there is compelling evidence that this will improve matters.
Clearly, the best outcome would be a new, large, free carpark near the
centre of the village, but reviving &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KPIG&lt;/span&gt; will not deliver this.
There were no District or County elections this year for Knebworth.
However, there were a number of seats contested elsewhere in the
District, and your new Council will have a significantly different
composition to that of the civic year just ended. Responses to the
consultation on the emerging Local Plan will continue to be processed by
hard-pressed officers until August or September, but when the report is
ready I am sure that the Local Plan will once again hit the headlines.
The Annual Meeting of the (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;) Council is scheduled take place on the
21st May. After this I will know which committees I am on, and who the
chairmen and vice-chairmen are of the various committees the make up the
District Council. I will be on the Southern Rural Committee, as this is
the one that deals with matters relating to the villages in the south of
the district, but I do not know yet which other committees (if any) I
shall be on.
June will be a month of fêtes and festivals. Do not forget to put the
details of the Knebworth Festival in your diaries. Full details can be
found elsewhere in this issue. I will be attending most of the events
and look forward to seeing you at&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>May</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/may.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-01T15:26:52+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-17T10:26:39+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2015-05-01:/may.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;May Newsletter 2015&amp;#8221;modified:&amp;nbsp;2020-05-09&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Review of my first year at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time you read this column I will have served as a member of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;
in the Knebworth Ward for (nearly) a whole year. It has been an eventful
one for matters that concern the District Council: a number of planning
applications for major brownfield developments, two solar farm
applications, the introduction of Knebworth&amp;#8217;s first Controlled Parking
Zone and the planned move of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt; Surgery.
Of course the biggest issue of all is the ongoing, and &amp;#8216;emerging&amp;#8217; Local
Plan, which will continue emerging for a considerable time before it is
adopted. The current timetable envisages that this will happen in April
2017, two years&amp;#8217; from now, but the probability that this timetable will
slip must be significant, in the light of the rate of progress so far.
I have done my best to represent the interests of all the residents of
the ward so far, and will continue to do so over the course of the next
civic year. I hope that my considerably increased experience of being a
District councillor will enable me to be no less effective than over the
previous twelve months, and hopefully a little bit more effective.
A large number of you have taken the opportunity to contact me, via
telephone, email and letter and I can assure you that I read every
communication personally, even if occasionally I may not have time to
send an individual response. There are, inevitably, many problems that
are not amenable to any easy solutions. A considerable part of my
postbag is connected to issues around road safety and parking. To this
end I am working towards re-starting the Knebworth Parking Initiative
Group in the coming year, a forum in which representatives from
Knebworwth village can have a dialogue with representatives of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;.
As many residents of Knebworth pointed out during the consultation on
the Local Plan, it is important that jobs are created locally if we are
to avoid having a community in which there is a good balance of local
employment and London commuters. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; is aware of the importance of
local economic activity and is looking for feedback on its Draft
Economic Development Strategy – ‘Productive North Herts’. This policy
aims to address issues related to growing new and existing businesses
across the District. The feedback from the consultation will form a
final strategy and action plan to help the economy grow and generate
employment opportunities locally. A draft Economic Development Strategy
has been published and feedback is encouraged via the Consultations area
of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website, or by post to Economic Development, North
Hertfordshire District Council, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PO&lt;/span&gt; Box 480, Sale, M33 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;0DE&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>April</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/april.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-04-01T15:26:52+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-17T10:26:39+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2015-04-01:/april.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;April Newsletter 2015&amp;#8221;modified:&amp;nbsp;2020-05-09&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;April 2015&amp;nbsp;Newsletter&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended a meeting on 11 March with representatives of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; and
Stevenage Borough Council about the transfer of ownership and management
of Norton Green Common to Knebworth Parish Council. The discussion was
very constructive, and all parties confirmed that they could envisage no
major obstacles to the transfers taking place. The legal process will
take some time, and the Parish Council have yet to ratify that they wish
to take on this expanded role, but I believe that this meeting was a
milestone towards the goal of improving the Common as an important piece
of amenity land within the Parish.
The Secretary of State for the Department for Communities and Local
Government has confirmed that an inquiry will be held under Section 77
of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 into the application for
planning permission for the Swangleys Lane Solar Farm. Datchworth Parish
Council plan to submit evidence and make a representation to the
inquiry. They are looking for financial support from other Parish
Councils and other interested parties. The inquiry will examine the
appropriateness of developing this installation on this site in the
Green Belt.
On a separate, but related matter, the planning application for the
solar generation facility at Three Houses Lane (ref. 14/02360/1) has
been amended and is being reviewed by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;. The scale of the
installation has been reduced, to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;5MW&lt;/span&gt;, but it remains in the Green Belt.
Nicholas Pellett is leading the objectors to this application. Knebworth
Parish Council are opposed to the application.
Steve Deakin Davies is looking for singers to appear in a video for the
Knebworth Festival, on 26 June. Lots of events and activities are
planned for the day, including a video featuring Knebworth singers, each
singing a line of &amp;#8216;Perfect Day&amp;#8217;, along the lines of the famous &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt;
video. Contact Steve on 07508832581 for more&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Swangley&amp;#8217;s Farm Solar &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed solar farm at Swangley&amp;#8217;s Farm has been &amp;#8216;called in&amp;#8217;. It will
be referred to the Secretary of State for the Dept. for Communities and
Local Government under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, Section
70. This was the recommendation of the planning officer of the District
Council. Documents relating to the application will now have to be
examined by the Planning Inspectorate. As of the time of writing, it is
not clear how long this process will&amp;nbsp;take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Council&amp;nbsp;Tax&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the District Council of the 12th February it was decided to increase
its proportion of Council tax by 1.9%, or &amp;pound;3.88 for a Band D property in
Knebworth. For such a property the contribution to the District Council
becomes &amp;pound;208.01. The balance of what you pay on your Council Tax is made
up of contributions to the Parish, the Police and the County, in order
of increasing cost, for the important services they provide to us&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Welwyn Hatfield Local Plan&amp;nbsp;Consultation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welwyn Hatfield has started consulting on its Local Plan. Responses must
be submitted by the 20th March, so there is still time for you to
comment. For residents of Knebworth the proposal that is likely to be of
most interest is the potential development of the field between Gun
Meadow Avenue and Monread Lodge, although there are a number of
proposals along the B197 which will have an impact on Knebworth.
There is a Local Plan drop-in Consultation Event for the Welhat Plan on
7th March at Hatfield Hub, 56, Town Centre, Hatfield, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AL10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;0JJ&lt;/span&gt;. For

&lt;p&gt;Herts County Council have now confirmed their intention of Herts County
Council that its intention is to enter into an agreement with General
Practice Investments, a developer, to re-develop the current library
site into a new Library, a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt; surgery and an associated pharmacy. This
is subject to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HCC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPI&lt;/span&gt; finding acceptable terms for the agreement.
Stephen McPartland, Richard Thake and I, together with Graham
Fothergill, representing both the Patient Participation Group, and the
Parish Council, had a meeting last year, with the practice manager where
we learned of this general intention. It is only this month (Jan) that
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HCC&lt;/span&gt; have confirmed their general intention.
I am sure that residents of the village will all welcome this
development, which should ensure that Knebworth has a modern,
fit-for-purpose, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt; surgery for many years to come. As many of you will
know, the library site has been the one that has been preferred by
Knebworth and Marymead General Practice for some years. I am very glad
that the process has moved on a stage so that we can look forward to a
new surgery opening, if everything goes well, in the next few&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Norton Green&amp;nbsp;Common&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to report that Knebworth Parish Council has entered into a
Stewardship Agreement with Natural England for the management of Norton
Green Common. This agreement comes with over seven hundred pounds of
grants from Natural England to restore the Common to a good condition.
However the work needs to be done and the subcommittee are looking for
volunteers to do it! It is hoped that two days of will be organised in
the New Year when volunteers will be invited to work on clearance of the
Common. In addition to the grant from Natural England, now the Common is
registered it is eligible for payments from the Rural Payments Agency.
To find out more please contact the Clerk to the Parish Council.
I should mention that the Stewardship Agreement represents major
progress in the log hard slog that is the restoration of Norton Green
Common. It would not have been possible without tireless effort on the
part of Rosemary Pateman, Karen Robinson and the Parish&amp;nbsp;Clerk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Local&amp;nbsp;Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time you read this the Extraordinary Parish Meeting scheduled for
the 20th January will have been held. There is time to send your
response to the consultation to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;. Just email your comments to

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Local Plan - Preferred Options&amp;nbsp;Consultation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The submissions made by members of the public to the Preferred Options Consultation, undertaken as part of the development of a new Local Plan, are now available on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;’s website. Every written response is available to read online - go to the page you get to by searching for &amp;#8216;&amp;#8220;Planning Policy Online Consultations&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;north-herts&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;’s Grants&amp;nbsp;Policy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A report on Grants Policy is due to be discussed at the meeting of Cabinet on the 15th December. This will be reviewed by the Overview and Scrutiny Committee by the end of February 2016.
Grants represent a modest, but important part of North Herts District Council’s cost base, and have to be reviewed just as we review all our spending commitments. Knebworth has to pay for the upkeep of its village hall, pavilion and recreation grounds through the precept levied by Knebworth Parish Council. Voters in the towns in the District have the equivalent expenditure paid for directly by the District Council, ie through the Council Tax paid by all householders in the District. Rural grants, to a degree, compensate villages for this anomaly. For this reason, the review of grants policy is very important to us, and I will continue to argue for a fair deal for the &amp;#8216;parished&amp;#8217; areas.
I would like to take a moment to reflect on the passing year. 2015 was a notable year with a number of major proposals put forward, most now decided, but others, most notably the development of the draft Local Plan, that will continue into 2016. Some of these could have significant impact on the village, and I hope you will continue to make your views known, and I will continue to try to reflect these in discussions with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; as your elected councillor.
There will be changes to your representation on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; as my fellow councillor, Alan Bardett, will be retiring at the end of his term in May 2016 when local elections will be held for some of the wards within &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; including, this time, Knebworth.
I look forward to the year ahead and wish you all a Happy New&amp;nbsp;Year.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>December Article</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/december-article.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-12-01T15:36:40+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-17T10:26:39+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2014-12-01:/december-article.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Waste Collection, Local&amp;nbsp;Plan&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Waste&amp;nbsp;Collection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Percival in last month&amp;#8217;s Parish News commented: &amp;#8220;contracted refuse collectors routinely dump emptied wheelie bins at random on pavements all around our village&amp;#8221;. I contacted the officer at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; responsible for the waste and recycling contract with Veolia and this is what she wrote about the&amp;nbsp;contract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The operatives should be placing any bins or boxes back where they
came from. They, in particular, should not be leaving them obstructing
driveways or footpaths unnecessarily. Windy days can be a problem
generally however if they are returned to the boundary of a property
they are often next to a wall or hedge which helps prevent this&amp;nbsp;problem.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do have Waste Services Officers out monitoring the contract, so I
have copied [the relevant officer] in who will be about to check some
of the streets in Knebworth over the next few&amp;nbsp;collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is clear that the Veolia operatives are not perfect, but hopefully
this reminder will provoke an improvement in the service. If residents
notice any problems they can contact the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; helpdesk on 0800 328 6023
who will monitor the level of complaints from Knebworth. Alternatively
feel free to contact me about this&amp;nbsp;directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;North Hertfordshire Local&amp;nbsp;Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; is due to vote on moving to the next stage in the production of the
Local Plan at its meeting on 27th November. This will approve the Local
Development Scheme which sets out the timetable for consultation, but
will include the publication of the &amp;#8220;Preferred Options&amp;#8221;, i.e. sites
which the council have put forward as suitable for development.
Consultation on this document, as well as on the numerous planning
policies that together with the sites form the Plan, will take place
from early December through to the first week of February (these are
provisional dates and are still to be confirmed). Full information about
the proposals will be available in the Library and on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Planning Matters -&amp;nbsp;Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solar Farm &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PV&lt;/span&gt; Applications&lt;/em&gt;: The Swangley’s Lane application was due to
be discussed by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Planning Control at its committee meeting on
13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; November but the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; officer wrote to advise me that it
had been withdrawn from the agenda as the applicant had written to the
planning officers &amp;#8220;setting out additional proposals to mitigate the
impact of the scheme on the surrounding landscape and to address the
concerns regarding the impact of the development on the Green Belt.&amp;#8221;.
There will now be further public consultation and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; expect it to be
discussed at the planning meeting on 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; December.
Consideration of the Three Houses Lane solar farm has been delayed
because of errors in the application and no date is yet scheduled for it
to come before the planning&amp;nbsp;committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knebworth Park Cricket Club&lt;/em&gt;: Consideration of this application was
deferred by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; planning because of late submission of a revised design
of the pavilion and of a Flood Risk Assessment and drainage plans. It is
expected that the application will be reconsidered at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Planning
Control committee meeting on 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;111 London Road&lt;/em&gt;: Following our objections, the developer provided a
revised application with extra parking spaces and a contribution to
affordable housing in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; area and the committee has now accepted&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>November Article</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/november-article.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-11-01T15:36:40+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-17T10:26:39+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2014-11-01:/november-article.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Surgery, Solar Farm, Cricket Club, Bulwer&amp;nbsp;Lytton&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Application to redevelop the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt; Surgery at 1 Stevenage&amp;nbsp;Road&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future of Knebworth and Marymead &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt; Practice at 1 London Road has
been uncertain for a considerable time. Various proposals for it moving
have been discussed without any coming close to fruition. A number of
residents were surprised to read about an application to redevelop the
surgery into eight one-bedroom flats, submitted by the owner of the
site.
As I understand it, this application was submitted to protect the
position of the owner in the event the surgery gives notice to quit. The
practice may do so at short notice under the current tenure, which, so
it is understandable that the landlord should enact some contingency
plans. The current surgery is outdated and unsatisfactory in a number of
ways: it would clearly be better if more modern premises were available,
whether on the current site, or another one. To find out more about the
options available I will be meeting with the surgery and a number of
interested parties in the second half of&amp;nbsp;October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Knebworth Park Cricket&amp;nbsp;Club&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the order of sixty people turned up to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt; Planning Control
Committee on Monday 13th October to hear it consider the application for
a new clubhouse and two pitches on Jubilee Fields, to the east of Park
Lane opposite the Alms Houses and Mulberry Cottages in Old Knebworth.
Feelings ran high, with strong arguments on both sides. The committee
decided to oppose the application. A date for it to be considered by
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; has not yet been set. I am sure that when a date has been set there
will be a big turnout at the Council Chamber in Letchworth. You can be
sure that I&amp;#8217;ll be present and will be writing about the&amp;nbsp;decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Bulwer Lytton&amp;nbsp;application&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developer has submitted an application to develop thirteen detached
houses on the site of the former care home, Bulwer Lytton House. Some of
these houses are close to neighbouring properties, they occupy a large
part of the plan of the site, and the plan allows for the retention of
fewer trees than the previous application, for outline planning
permission, submitted on behalf of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HCC&lt;/span&gt; which owned the site. I will be
trying to persuade the Planning Control Committee at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; to reject this
application at its meeting on the 16th&amp;nbsp;October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;111 London Road&amp;nbsp;Application&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long awaited amended application for twenty-six one-bedroom flats on
the site of the former boy&amp;#8217;s home at 111 London Road was submitted and
reviewed by the Parish Council last month. The Planning Committee were
not persuaded that the changes addressed any of the grounds on which
they objected to the application the last time it was&amp;nbsp;considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Pondcroft Road, Milestone Road, Gun Lane Draft Traffic Regulation&amp;nbsp;Order&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consultation about introducing a Controlled Parking Zone in some
roads near Knebworth railway station finished in early October.
Unfortunately too early for me to draw attention to it in the previous
edition of this newsletter. I have not received any indication of the
results of this consultation from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;, as of today, but to the extent
that I received any feedback the balance of opinion was opposed to the
proposals, albeit with a number of residents being enthusiastic.
At the same time, although not part of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TRO&lt;/span&gt;, a preliminary
consultation to reduce the amount of parking in Watton Road took place.
I received one or two calls, but not enough to be confident of gauging
the general mood of residents in the road, which does suffer a great
deal as a &amp;#8216;rat run&amp;#8217; to parts of Stevenage, as well as being the main
route to the A602&amp;nbsp;south.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Solar&amp;nbsp;Farms&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planning application for the proposed Solar Farm at Swangley’s Farm
has not yet been scheduled to come before a Planning Control Committee,
but the protestors continue to challenge the application. As I
understand it, an attempt is being made to challenge the decision to
dispense with an Environmental Impact Assessment as part of the
application. I expect that the application will go before &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; this
month.
There is a second application to build a solar farm, this time on land
south of Three Houses Lane, north of Codicote. There was a lively
discussion about this application at the Parish Council Planning
Committee which was held on Monday 13th October. Although this is a
sparsely populated part of Knebworth Parish, a number of residents took
part in the Public Participation. The Parish Council decided to object
to the application on the grounds that it felt it was inappropriate for
the Green&amp;nbsp;Belt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Fly&amp;nbsp;Tipping&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had a number of reports of fly tipping around Knebworth, made
directly to me. North Hertfordshire District Council treats fly-tipping
very seriously and will prosecute anyone caught fly-tipping waste. Fly
tipping is irresponsible, dangerous and expensive to clear up. There is
a form on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website (just search for ‘fly tipping’) or feel free
to contact me.
Fly tipping on private land is not the responsibility of the local
authority, but on the public highway it is. For larger scale fly tipping
the Environment Agency has a statutory duty to investigate fly tipping
when the waste may pose a serious threat to the&amp;nbsp;environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;North Hertfordshire Local&amp;nbsp;Plan&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Local Development Scheme has now been published. It can be viewed on
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; website (under Planning, Planning Policy and Projects). This
sets out a timetable for the development of the Local Plan. This process
includes several rounds of consultation, including one on the ‘Preferred
Options’ and on the submission itself, before it is formally submitted
to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government in April
2016.
As far as anyone can tell, writing in mid-October, we are still on
course for submission of the preferred options paper, including the
potential housing sites, to Full Council on 27th November 2014.
Consultation on this paper is scheduled for the fifth of December to the
end of January 2015. Formal submission of the final version likely to
take place in Summer 2015.
If you are interested in finding out which parts of the District are
likely to see residential growth in the ‘plan period’ to 2031 please
check the Council’s website for the Full Council agenda which should be
available online from around mid-November.
There have been reports recently of extra clarification from the current
Secretary of State which appears to give priority to preservation of the
Green Belt over the directive to meet objectively assessed housing
needs, both ours and those of adjacent authorities. These conflicting
messages from Central Government need in my view to be resolved very
rapidly. I am joining with a number of my fellow district councillors in
urging the planning officers and members at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; to press for such&amp;nbsp;resolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>October Article</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/october-article.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-10-01T15:36:40+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-17T10:26:39+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2014-10-01:/october-article.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Surgery, Solar Farm, Cricket Club, Grants, Norton&amp;nbsp;Green&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Planning&amp;nbsp;Matters&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several significant applications are due to be considered by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KPC&lt;/span&gt;
Planning Committee on 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; October. Please submit your
comments to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; before the deadline if you have views, and/or raise
them with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KPC&lt;/span&gt; Planning Committee. As in all Parish and District
Council meetings, members of the public are welcome to attend committee&amp;nbsp;meetings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knebworth &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt; Surgery&lt;/strong&gt;: An application has been made for 1 Stevenage
Road a proposal for eight one-bedroom flats on the site of the Knebworth
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt; Surgery – the deadline for comments to be made to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; is
9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; October, and as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HCC&lt;/span&gt; is responsible for the provision of
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GP&lt;/span&gt; surgeries, Knebworth’s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HCC&lt;/span&gt; representative, Cllr Richard Thake, is
fully&amp;nbsp;involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solar Farms&lt;/strong&gt;: At its last planning meeting &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KPC&lt;/span&gt; objected to the
proposed Swangley’s Lane Solar Farm, having had extensive discussion and
views expressed by residents, other members of the public and the
developer, and will be considering a second solar farm at Crouch Green,
on Three Houses Lane (deadline 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; October).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knebworth Park Cricket Club&lt;/strong&gt;: An amended application is due to be
considered (deadline 30&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; October).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other residential&lt;/strong&gt;: A new application for the Bulwer Lytton House
site in Lytton Fields (deadline 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; October) and an
application for proposed development at 111 London Road will also be&amp;nbsp;considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; – Capital and Grant Funding&amp;nbsp;Awards&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two awards of additional funding have been made by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;committees:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A grant of &amp;pound;7,000 has been awarded to Knebworth Parish Council by
    the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Rural Community Halls Capital Fund. This will allow a major
    upgrade to the heating system in the Village Hall, just in time for
    the cold winter&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Knebworth Day Centre for the vulnerable and elderly received a
    boost when it received a grant of &amp;pound;1,000 from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;’s Southern Rural
    Area Committee to help with operational costs. Knebworth Day Centre,
    a not-for-profit organisation staffed by ten volunteers, has
    provided social activities for elderly and frail people for 25
    years, and currently around 15 members meet every Monday from 10am
    to&amp;nbsp;3pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Parking – Proposals for Further&amp;nbsp;Restrictions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that some of you were able to attend the meeting in the Village
Hall on 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; September when proposals to introduce further
parking restrictions in Pondcroft Road, Milestone Road, Deanscroft, Gun
Lane, Gun Road and (to a minor extent) Station Road. There is also a
proposal, although at an earlier stage, to introduce parking
restrictions in Watton Road. Full details are available in the Library
or on the Parish Council and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; websites. Please be quick as the
deadline for comments is 3rd October – you can email comments to
&lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#97;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#58;&amp;#116;&amp;#114;&amp;#97;&amp;#110;&amp;#115;&amp;#112;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#64;&amp;#110;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#104;&amp;#45;&amp;#104;&amp;#101;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#115;&amp;#46;&amp;#103;&amp;#111;&amp;#118;&amp;#46;&amp;#117;&amp;#107;"&gt;&amp;#116;&amp;#114;&amp;#97;&amp;#110;&amp;#115;&amp;#112;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#64;&amp;#110;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#104;&amp;#45;&amp;#104;&amp;#101;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#115;&amp;#46;&amp;#103;&amp;#111;&amp;#118;&amp;#46;&amp;#117;&amp;#107;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fly Tipping and illegal access to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSSI&lt;/span&gt; on the Common continues to be
a problem. Representatives of Natural England and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HCC&lt;/span&gt; have just been out
to look at the tipping and have proposed a solution to restrict access
on the Common by introducing bollards right along up to the beginning of
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSSI&lt;/span&gt;. Knebworth Estates have agreed pay for the bollards as they
will also stop access to their woodland, which has suffered from fly
tipping in the&amp;nbsp;past.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Knebworth Parish News, Sept 2014</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/knebworth-parish-news-sept-2014.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-09-01T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2014-09-01:/knebworth-parish-news-sept-2014.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Proposal to build a solar&amp;nbsp;farm&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Swangley&amp;#8217;s Farm Solar &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may already be aware, there is a proposal to build a &amp;#8216;solar farm&amp;#8217;
on one of the fields comprising Swangley&amp;#8217;s Farm. This will involve
covering much of the field with solar panels, fixed on metal frames,
installing a container-sized inverter building, and connecting the
latter to the grid. The field is at the junction of Swangley&amp;#8217;s Lane and
Baines Lane, at the eastern boundary of the parish, where it borders
Datchworth Parish. The field is approximately fifty acres. Full details
are available on the website of Solstice Renewables, the developer, as
well as on the Parish Council&amp;nbsp;website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another proposal has been made for a similar-sized solar farm at Three
Houses Farm, between Three Houses Lane and Node Wood. This is in the
western &amp;#8216;finger&amp;#8217; of the Parish, which encompasses Rusling End and Three
Houses Lane. No planning application has been made for this development
as yet, so it is too early to say any more about it. It is notable that
a number of these developments have been proposed in nearby parishes,
including in Graveley and Langley. This may be linked to the current
subsidy levels, which are due to change in April&amp;nbsp;2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is expected that the fully validated applications for these two solar
farms will have been accepted by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; by September. In the case of the
Swangley&amp;#8217;s Farm site, a &amp;#8216;screening opinion&amp;#8217; has already been received
and approved. This is a preliminary enquiry to determine what documents
must be accompany in the application itself. The approval of this
screening opinion application does not have any bearing on whether the
development application itself will be&amp;nbsp;approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process for deciding on these applications is as follows. Once the
application has been validated, it will be uploaded to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; planning
portal. The application will be examined by the Parish Council (or which
I am a member) at a meeting of the Planning Committee, typically the
first meeting after the application has been validated. Members of the
public are welcome to attend this meeting. A period, typically fifteen
minutes before the meeting formally starts, is allocated for members of
the public to give their views. The discussion about the application is
held in public, and, usually, the committee decides whether it has any
objection to the application, and, if it has, on what ground(s) it
objects. It may also decide to support an application in some cases, or
merely to not object to&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to the process is deciding on which ground or grounds the
committee objects to the application. Planning applications must be
decided in relation to the relevant planning legislation. If an
application is not consistent with the Local Plan, or is outside the
guidelines defined in the national and local guidelines, then the Parish
Council may object, but the specific guideline that has been breached
must be identified. The decision of the Parish Council is not final: it
is merely a consultee, alongside possibly many others, depending on the
type of the application. Neighbours are another class of consultee: all
have the right to submit their comments to the Planning Authority, which
is in this case is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key decision to be made is whether or not the renewable energy
generated by these farms constitutes circumstances which are
sufficiently special to override the general principle that development
in the Green Belt is inappropriate. The relevant legislation is the
National Planning Policy Framework, supplemented by the government&amp;#8217;s
Planning Practice Guidance. Any decision about these applications, as in
the case of any other planning applications, will be decided in the
light of this planning legislation, not on the weight of local opinion
or on the value of renewable energy&amp;nbsp;generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work of the council does not stop over the summer, although it does
slow down a bit. I have now attended sessions of each of the committees
on which I sit: Southern Rural, Overview and Scrutiny, as well the first
meeting of the full council in this, its fortieth year civic year. I
have also undertaken various sessions of training and induction, and am
now inducted into the mysteries of everything from governance, to
planning to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt;. The planning training was of great interest, as it is
very relevant for understanding the implications of the long-awaited
Local Plan. Although I am not a member of any of the committees at the
District Council concerned with planning, I take a close interest in all
applications which may affect Knebworth and continue to be a member of
the Planning Committee on the Parish&amp;nbsp;Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Knebworth Fun&amp;nbsp;Day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knebworth residents, being British, were not deterred by the wet weather
over the final weekend of the Knebworth Festival. The Fancy Dress
Competition took place with only slightly reduced (and slightly damp)
numbers. Rosemary Conybeare and I were called to judge the entries.
Years 2, 3 and 4, which had succeeded in forming the biggest group by
the tactic of combining their members into a single entry, were clear
winners from a strong field which had, inevitably, a World Cup inspired&amp;nbsp;theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solar Farm&amp;nbsp;Application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An application is currently being considered to build a solar farm on
Swangley&amp;#8217;s Farm, to the East of Knebworth. This will cover fifty acres
and have a peak generating capacity of around 10 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MW&lt;/span&gt;. There will,
undoubtedly be a great deal of discussion about this in the village
between now and October of November when a decision will have to be made
by the planning authority on whether to approve the application. Full
details of the application are available on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHDC&lt;/span&gt; Planning&amp;nbsp;Portal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KPIG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hoped that the Knebworth Parking Initiative Group (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KPIG&lt;/span&gt;) will
spring back into life in the next month or so. The first issue that we
will tackle is the lack of parking in Pondcroft Road and Milestone Road,
which have been particularly affected by commuter and other parking
displaced from Park Lane, Lytton Fields, Deanscroft and other areas to
the west of the railway line, as well as from the St Martins Road car
park. I have received a number of communications about various traffic
issues in the village, including Gun Lane, Station Approach, Park Lane
to the west of the A1(M), as well as Pondcroft Road/Milestone&amp;nbsp;Road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="quo"&gt;&amp;#8216;&lt;/span&gt;Knebworth High St.&amp;#8217; - i.e. the shopping area at the northern end of
London Road is a particular source of concern, both because traffic can
be dangerously fast, and because congestion is so bad that ambulances
and other emergency vehicles may be held up&amp;nbsp;unacceptably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an unused lot in Gun Road Gardens which may be suitable as a
place where some extra parking spaces can be found. This has been
suggested by some members of the Knebworth Community Group on Facebook.
If you are a Facebook user, I urge you to join the group, as it provides
a valuable forum to discuss issues affecting the&amp;nbsp;village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Knebworth Village&amp;nbsp;Trust&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a District Councillor in Knebworth I am, &lt;em&gt;ex-officio&lt;/em&gt;, a trustee of
Knebworth Village Trust . This charity supports community groups based
within the parish of Knebworth. In our meeting on the 10th July we
decided to support a youth group run by the Trinity Church and the
(newly amalgamated) Knebworth Football Club. To find out whether your
community group could benefit from a grant from the Trust, please
contact the Hon. Secretary at info@knebworthtrust.com. The application
form for grants is available on their website:&amp;nbsp;www.knebworthtrust.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Norton Green&amp;nbsp;Subcommittee&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Norton Green Sub-Committee of the Planning and Environment Committee
of the Parish Council had its inaugural meeting on Independence Day, 4th
July. We had a detailed discussion about the legal ownership and status
of the common, which is a key&amp;nbsp;issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a very useful forum in which the interlocking issues affecting
the Common were identified. Members of the committee are: Rosemary
Conybeare, Rosemary Pateman, Karen Robinson, James Orme-Kirby and
myself, with the Clerk of the Parish Council, Claire Graham providing
much-needed&amp;nbsp;support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Parish Council would like to acquire title to the Common, which is
currently held by Stevenage Borough Council. Once this is achieved, it
is hoped that the management of this valuable resource, which includes a
Site of Special Scientific Interest, will be&amp;nbsp;improved.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Knebworth"></category><category term="NHDC"></category><category term="politics"></category></entry><entry><title>Explanatory Rules</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/explanatory-rules.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>1940-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-02-17T15:51:32+00:00</updated><author><name>me</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,1940-01-01:/explanatory-rules.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EXPLANATORY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RULES&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record prices in Downward Trend column in red&amp;nbsp;ink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record prices in the other four columns in&amp;nbsp;pencil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record prices in Upward Trend Column in black&amp;nbsp;ink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record prices in Downward Trend column in red&amp;nbsp;ink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record prices in the other four columns in&amp;nbsp;pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draw lines as&amp;nbsp;follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draw red lines under your last recorded price in the Upward Trend column the first day you start to record figures in the Natural Reaction column. You begin to do this on the first reaction of approximately six points from the last price recorded in the Upward Trend&amp;nbsp;column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draw red lines under your last recorded price in the Natural Reaction column the first day you start to record figures in the Natural Rally column or in the Upward Trend column. You begin to do this on the first rally of approximately six points from the last price recorded in the Natural Reaction&amp;nbsp;column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You now have two Pivotal Points to watch, and depending on how prices are recorded.       When the market returns to around one of those points, you will then be able to form an opinion as to whether the positive trend is going to be resumed in earnest—or whether the movement has&amp;nbsp;ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draw black lines under your last recorded price in the Downward Trend column the first day you start to record figures in the Natural Rally column. You begin to do this on the first rally of approximately six points from the last price recorded in the Downward Trend&amp;nbsp;column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draw black lines under your last recorded price in the Natural Rally column the first day you start to record figures in the Natural Reaction column or in the Downward Trend column. You begin to do this on the first reaction of approximately six points from the last price recorded in the Natural Rally&amp;nbsp;column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When recording in the Natural Rally column and a price is reached that is three or more points above the last price recorded in the Natural Rally column (with black lines underneath), then that price should be entered in black ink in the Upward Trend&amp;nbsp;column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When recording in the Natural Reaction column and a price is reached that is three or more points below the last price recorded in the Natural Reaction column (with red lines underneath), then that price should be entered in red ink in the Downward Trend&amp;nbsp;column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a reaction occurs to an extent of approximately six points, after you have been recording prices in the Upward Trend column, you then start to record those prices in the Natural Reaction column, and continue to do so every day thereafter that the stock sells at a price which is lower than the last recorded price in the Natural Reaction&amp;nbsp;column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a reaction occurs to an extent of approximately six points, after you have been recording prices in the Natural Rally column, you then start to record those Prices in the Natural Reaction column, and continue to do so every day thereafter that the stock sells at a price which is lower than the last recorded Price in the Natural Reaction column. In case a price is made which is lower than the last recorded price in the Downward Trend column, you would then record that price in the Downward Trend&amp;nbsp;column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a rally occurs to an extent of approximately six points, after you have been recording prices in the Downward Trend column, you then start to record those prices in the Natural Rally column, and continue to do so every day thereafter that the stock sells at a price which is higher than the last recorded price in the Natural Rally&amp;nbsp;column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a rally occurs to an extent of approximately six points, after you have been recording prices in the Natural Reaction column, you then start to record those prices in the Natural Rally column, and continue to do so every day thereafter that (i.e. stock sells at a price which is higher than the last recorded price in the Natural Rally column. In case a price is made which is higher than the last recorded price in the Upward Trend column, you would then record that price in the Upward Trend&amp;nbsp;column).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you start to record figures in the Natural Reaction column and a price is reached that is lower than the last recorded figure in the Downward Trend column—then that price should be entered in red ink in the Downward Trend&amp;nbsp;column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same rule applies when you are recording figures in the Natural Rally column and a price is reached that is higher than the last price recorded in the Upward Trend column—then you would cease recording in the Natural Rally column and record that price in black ink in the Upward Trend&amp;nbsp;column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you had been recording in the Natural Reaction column and a rally should occur of approximately six points from the last recorded figure in the Natural Reaction column — but that price did not exceed the last price recorded in the Natural Rally column—that price should be recorded in the Secondary Rally column and should continue to be so recorded until a price had been made which exceeded the last figure recorded in the Natural Rally column. When that occurs, you should commence to record prices in the Natural Rally column once&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you have been recording in the Natural Rally column and a reaction should occur of approximately six points, but the price reached on that reaction was not lower than the last recorded figure in your Natural Reaction column—that price should be entered in your Secondary Reaction column, and you should continue to record prices in that column until a price was made that was lower than the last price recorded in the Natural Reaction column. When that occurs, you should commence to record prices in the Natural Reaction column once&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same rules apply when recording the Key Price—except that you use twelve points as a basis instead of six points used in individual&amp;nbsp;stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last price recorded in the Downward or Upward Trend columns becomes a Pivotal Point as soon as you begin to record prices in the Natural Rally or Natural Reaction columns. After a rally or reaction has ended you start to record again in the reverse column, and the extreme price made in the previous column then becomes another Pivotal&amp;nbsp;Point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is after two Pivotal Point have been reached that these records become of great value to you in helping you anticipate correctly the next movement of importance. These Pivotal Points are drawn to your attention by having a double line drawn underneath them in either red ink or black ink. Those tines are drawn for the express purpose of keeping those points before you and should be watched very carefully whenever prices are made and recorded near or at one of those points. Your decision to act will then depend on how prices are recorded from then&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you see black lines drawn below the last recorded red-ink figure in the Downward Trend column—you may be given a signal to buy near that&amp;nbsp;point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When black lines are drawn below a Price recorded in the Natural Rally column, and if the stock on its next rally reaches a point near that Pivotal Point price, that is the time you are going to find out whether the market is strong enough definitely to change its course into the Upward Trend&amp;nbsp;column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reverse holds true when you see red lines drawn under the last price recorded in the Upward Trend column, and when red lines are drawn below the last price recorded in the Natural Reaction&amp;nbsp;column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole method is designed to enable one to see clearly whether a stock is acting the way it ought to, after its first Natural Rally or Reaction has occurred. If the movement is going to be resumed in a positive manner—either up or down —it will carry through its previous Pivotal Point—in individual stocks by three points, or, in the Key Price by six&amp;nbsp;points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the stock fails to do this—and in a reaction sells three points or more below the last Pivotal Point (recorded in the Upward Trend column with red lines drawn underneath), it would indicate that the Upward Trend in the stock is&amp;nbsp;over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying the rule to the Downward Trend: Whenever, after a Natural Rally has ended, new prices are being recorded in the Downward Trend column, these new prices must extend three or more points below the last Pivotal Point (with black lines underneath), if the Downward Trend is to be positively&amp;nbsp;resumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the stock fails to do this, and on a rally sells three or more points above the last Pivotal Point (recorded in the Downward Trend column with black lines drawn underneath), it would indicate that the Downward Trend in the stock is&amp;nbsp;over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When recording in the Natural Rally column, if the rally ends a short distance below the last Pivotal Point in the Upward Trend column (with red lines underneath), and the stock reacts three or more points from that price, it is a danger signal, which would indicate the Upward Trend in that stock is&amp;nbsp;over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When recording in the Natural Reaction column, if the reaction ends a short distance above the last Pivotal Point in the Downward Trend column (with black lines underneath), and the stock rallies three or more points from that price, it is a danger signal, which would indicate the Downward Trend in that stock is&amp;nbsp;over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chart&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 2nd, prices began to be recorded in Naturall Rally column, Refer to Rule 6-b. Draw black line under last price in Downward Trend column. Refer to Rule&amp;nbsp;4-c.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chart&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these prices recorded are brought forth from the prceding page in order to keep the Pivotal Points always before&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the period from May 5th to May 21st inclusive, no prices were  recorded because no prices were made lower than the last price recorded in the Natural Reaction column. Nor was there sufficient rally to be&amp;nbsp;recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 27th, the price of Bethlehem Steel was recorded in red because it was a lower price than the previous price recorded in the Downward Trend column. Refer to Rule&amp;nbsp;6-C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 2nd, Bethlehem Steel became a buy at 43. Refer to Rule 10-C and D. On the same day, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Steel became a buy at 42J4. Refer to Rule&amp;nbsp;10-F.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One June 10th, a price was recorded on the Secondary Rally column of Bethlehem Steel. Refer to Rule&amp;nbsp;6-E.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chart&amp;nbsp;3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 20th, the price of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Steel was reorded in the Secondary Rally column. Refer to Rule&amp;nbsp;6-G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 24th, prices of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Steel and Bethlehem Steel were recorded in black ink in the Upward Trend column. Refer to Rule&amp;nbsp;5-A. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 11th, prices of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Steel were recorded in the Natural Reaction column. Refer to Rule 6-A and&amp;nbsp;4-A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 19th, prices of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Steel and Bethlehem Steel were recorded in the Upward Trend column in black ink because those prices were higher than those columns. Refer to&amp;nbsp;4-B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Chart&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 12th, the price of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Steel was recorded in the Secondary Reaction column, because the price was not lower than the last price previously recorded in the Natural Reaction column. On the same day, the price of Bethlehem Steel was recorded in the Natural Reaction column because that price was lower than the last price previously recorded in the Natural Reaction&amp;nbsp;Column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 24th, prices of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Steel and Bethlehem Steel were recorded in the Natural Rally column. Refer to Explanatory Rule&amp;nbsp;6-D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 29th, prices of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Steel and Bethlehem Steel were recorded in the Secondary Reaction column. Refer to Rule&amp;nbsp;6-H.&lt;/p&gt;

But it is not necessary to lose your money, once you have acquired …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOLLOW&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LEADERS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is always the temptation in the stock market, after a period of success, to become careless or excessively ambitious. Then it requires sound common sense and clear thinking to keep what you have. But it is not necessary to lose your money, once you have acquired it, if you will hold fast to sound&amp;nbsp;principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that prices move up and down. They always have and they always will. My theory is that behind these major movements is an irresistible force. That is all one needs to know. It is not well to be too curious about all the reasons behind price movements. You risk the danger of clouding your mind with non-essentials. Just recognize that the movement is there and take advantage of it by steering your speculative ship along with the tide. Do not argue with the condition, and most of all, do not try to combat&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember too that it is dangerous to start spreading out all over the market. By this I mean, do not have an interest in too many stocks at one time. It is much easier to watch a few than many. I made that mistake years ago and it cost me&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another mistake I made was to permit myself to turn completely bearish or bullish on the whole market, because one stock in some particular group had plainly reversed its course from the general market trend. Before making a new commitment I should have been patient and waited the time. When some stock in another group had indicated to me that its decline or advance had ended. In time, other stocks would dearly give the same indication. Those are the cues I should have waited&amp;nbsp;for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put instead of doing so. I felt the costly urge of getting busy in the whole market. Thus I permitted the hankering for activity to replace common sense and judgment. Of course I made money on the trades in the first and second groups. But I chipped away a substantial part of it by entering other groups before the zero hour had&amp;nbsp;arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the wild bull markets of the late twenties, I saw clearly that the advance in the copper stocks had come to an end. A short time later the advance in the motor group had reached its zenith. Because the bull market in those two groups had terminated, I soon arrived at the faulty conclusion that I could safely sell everything. I should hate to tell you the amount of money I lost by acting upon that&amp;nbsp;premise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was piling up huge paper profits on my copper and motor deals, I lost even more in the next six months trying to find the top of the utility group. Eventually this and other groups reached their peaks. By that time Anaconda was selling 50 points below its previous high and the motor stocks in about the same&amp;nbsp;ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I wish to impress upon you is the fact that when you clearly see a move coming in a particular group, act upon it. But do not let yourself act in the same way in some other group, until you plainly see signs that the second group is in a position to follow suit. Have patience and wait. In time you will get the same tip-off in other groups that you received in the first group. Just don&amp;#8217;t spread out over the&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confine your studies of movements to the prominent stocks of the day. If you cannot make money out of the leading active issues, you arc not going to make money out of the stock market as a&amp;nbsp;whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as styles in women&amp;#8217;s gowns and hats and costume jewelry are forever changing with time, the old leaders of the stock market are dropped and new ones rise up to take their places. Years ago the chief leaders were the railroads, American Sugar, and Tobacco. Then came the steels, and American Sugar and Tobacco were nudged into the background. Then came the motors, and so on up to the present time. Today we have only four groups in the position of dominating the market: steels, motors, aircraft stocks, and mail orders. As they go, so goes the whole market. In the course of time new leaders will come to the front; some of the old leaders will be dropped. It will always be that way as long as there is a stock&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely it is not safe to try to keep account of too many stocks at one time. You will become entangled and confused. Try to analyze comparatively few groups. You will find it is much easier to obtain a true picture that way than if you tried to dissect the whole market. If you analyze correctly the course of two stocks in the four prominent groups, you need not worry about what the rest are going to do. It becomes the old story of &amp;#8220;follow the leader.&amp;#8221; Keep mentally flexible. Remember the leaders of today may not be the leaders two years from now. Today, in my records I keep four individual groups. That does not mean I am trading in all of the groups at the same time. But I have a genuine purpose in&amp;nbsp;mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first became interested in the movement of prices long, long ago, I decided to test my ability to anticipate correctly forthcoming movements. I recorded fictitious trades in a little book which was always with me. In the course of time, I made my first actual trade. I never will forget that trade. I had half-interest in a purchase of five shares of Chicago, Burlington &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Quincy Railway Stock, bought with a friend of mine, and my share of the profit amounted to $3.12. From that time on I became a speculator on my&amp;nbsp;own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under conditions as they currently exist, I do not believe that a speculator of the old type who traded in huge volume has much chance of success. When I say a speculator of the old type, I am thinking of the days when markets were very broad and liquid and when a speculator might take a position with 5,000 or 10,000 shares of a stock and move in and out without greatly influencing the&amp;nbsp;price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking his initial position, if the stock acted right, the speculator could safely add to his line from that time forward. In former times, if his judgment proved faulty, he could move out of his position easily without taking too serious a loss. But today, if his first position proved untenable, he would suffer a devastating loss in changing about because of the comparative narrowness of the&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, as I have implied previously, the speculator of today who has the patience and judgment to wait the proper time for acting has, in my opinion, a better chance of cashing in good profits eventually, because the current market does not lend itself to So many artificial movements, movements that far too frequently in the old days jarred all scientific calculations out of&amp;nbsp;kilter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is obvious, therefore, that in light of conditions which exist today, no speculator who is intelligent will permit himself to operate on that scale which was more or less a commonplace some years ago. He will study a limited number of groups and of leaders in those groups. He will learn to look before he leaps. For a new age of markets has been ushered in—an age that offers safer opportunities for the reasonable, studious, competent investor and&amp;nbsp;speculator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This classic book, first published in 1940, sets forth the specific trading techniques and methods used by the legendary Jesse Livermore. It has been out of print for many years and generally unavailable to the trading public. It completes the trilogy of books by and about Livermore (Reminiscences of A Stock Operator; Jesse Livermore: Speculator King; and How To Trade In&amp;nbsp;Stocks). &lt;/p&gt;

Faulty speculation is …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MONEY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HAND&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are handling surplus income do not delegate the task to anyone. whether you are dealing In millions or in thousands the same principal lesson applies. It is your money. It will remain with you just so long as you guard it. Faulty speculation is one of the most certain ways of losing&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blunders by incompetent speculators cover a wide scale. I have warned against averaging losses. That is a most common practice. Great numbers of people will buy a stock, let us say at 50, and two or three days later if they can buy it at 47 they are seized with the urge to average down by buying another hundred, making a price of 48.50 on all. Having bought at 50 and being concerned over a three-point loss on a hundred shares, what rhyme or reason is there in adding another hundred shares and having the double worry when the price hits 44? At that point there would be a $600 loss on the first hundred shares and a $300 loss on the second hundred&amp;nbsp;shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one is to apply such an unsound principle, he should keep on averaging by buying two hundred shares at 44, then four hundred at 41, eight hundred at 38, sixteen hundred at 35. thirty-two hundred at 32, sixty-four hundred at 29 and so on. How many speculators could stand such pressure? Yet if the policy is sound it should not be abandoned. Of course abnormal moves such the one indicated do not happen often. But it is just such abnormal moves against which the speculator must guard to avoid&amp;nbsp;disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, at the risk of repetition and preaching, let me urge you to avoid averaging&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know but one sure tip from a broker. It is your margin call. When it reaches you, close your account. You are on the wrong side of the market. Why send good money after bad? Keep that good money for another day. Risk it on something more attractive than an obviously losing&amp;nbsp;deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A successful businessman extends credit to various customers but would dislike to sell his entire output to one customer. The larger the number of customers the more widely the risk is spread. Just so, a person engaged in the business of speculation should risk only a limited amount of capital on any one venture. Cash to the speculator is as merchandise on the shelves of the&amp;nbsp;merchant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One major mistake of all speculators is the urge to enrich themselves in too short a time. Instead of taking two or three years to make 500% on their capital, they try to do it in two or three months. Now and then they succeed. But do such daring traders keep it? They do not. Why? Because it is unhealthy money, rolling in rapidly, and stopping for but a short visit. The speculator in such instances loses his sense of balance. He says: &amp;#8220;If I can make 500% on my capital in two months, think what I will do in the next two! I will make a&amp;nbsp;fortune.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such speculators are never satisfied. They continue to shoot the works until somewhere a cog slips, something happens—something drastic, unforeseen, and devastating. At length comes that final margin call from the broker, the call that cannot be met, and this type of plunger goes out like a lamp. He may plead with the broker for a little more time, or if he is not too unfortunate, he may have saved a nest-egg permitting a modest new&amp;nbsp;start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Businessmen opening a shop or a store would not expect to make over 25% on their investment the first year. But to people who enter the speculative field 25% is nothing. They are looking for 100%. And their calculations are faulty; they fail to make speculation a business and run it on business&amp;nbsp;principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is another little point that might well be remembered. A speculator should make it a rule each time he closes out a successful deal to take one-half of his profits and lock this sum up in a safe deposit box. The only money that is ever taken out of Wall Street by speculators is the money they draw out of their accounts after closing a successful&amp;nbsp;deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recall one day in Palm Beach. I left New York with a fairly large short position open. A few days after my arrival in Palm Beach the market had a severe break. That was an opportunity to cash ‘paper profits&amp;#8221; into real money—and I&amp;nbsp;did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the market closed I gave a message to the telegraph operator to tell the New York office to send immediately to my bank one million dollars to be deposited to my credit. The telegraph operator almost passed out. After sending the message, he asked if he might keep that slip. I inquired why. He said he had been an operator for twenty years and that was the first message he ever sent asking a broker to deposit in a bank money for the account of a customer. He went&amp;nbsp;on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Thousands and thousands of messages have gone over the wire from brokers demanding margins from customers. But never before one like yours. I want to show it to the&amp;nbsp;boys.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only time the average speculator can draw money from his brokerage account is when he has no position open or when he has an excessive equity. He won&amp;#8217;t draw it out when the markets are going against him because he needs all his capital for margin. He won&amp;#8217;t draw it out after closing a successful deal because he says to himself: &amp;#8220;Next time I&amp;#8217;ll make twice as&amp;nbsp;much.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently most speculators rarely see the money. To them the money is nothing real, nothing tangible. For years, after a successful deal was closed, I made it a habit to draw out cash. I used to draw it out at the rate of $200,000 or $300,000 a clip. It is a good policy. It has a psychological value. Make it a policy to do that. Count the money over. I did. I knew I had something in my hand. I felt it. It was&amp;nbsp;real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money in a brokers account or in a bank account at is not the same as if you feel it in your own fingers once in a while. Then it means something. There is a sense of possession that makes you just a little bit less inclined to take headstrong chances of losing your gains. So have a look at your real money once in a while, particularly between your market&amp;nbsp;deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is too much looseness in these matters on the part of the average&amp;nbsp;speculator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a speculator is fortunate enough to double his original capital he should at once draw out one- half of his profit to be set aside for reserve. This policy has been tremendously helpful to me on many occasions. I only regret that I have not observed it throughout my career. In some places it would have smoothed the&amp;nbsp;path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never have been able to make a dollar outside of Wall Street. But I have lost many millions of dollars, which I had taken from Wall Street, &amp;#8220;investing&amp;#8221; in other ventures. I have in mind real estate in the Florida boom, oil wells, airplane manufacturing, and the perfecting and marketing of products based on new inventions. Always I lost every&amp;nbsp;cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of these outside Ventures which had whipped up my enthusiasm I sought to interest a friend of mine to the extent of $50,000. He listened to my story very attentively. When I had finished he said: ‘Livermore, you will never make a success in any business outside of your own. Now if you want $50,000 with which to speculate it is yours for the asking. But please speculate and stay away from business.&amp;#8221; Next morning, to my surprise, the mail brought a check for that amount which I did not&amp;nbsp;need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson here again is that speculation itself is a business and should be so viewed by all. Do not permit yourself to be influenced by excitement, flattery or temptation. Keep in mind that brokers sometimes innocently become the undoing of many speculators. Brokers are in the business to make commissions. They cannot make commissions unless customers trade. The more trade, the more commissions. The speculator wants to trade and the broker not only is willing but too often encourages over-trading. The uninformed speculator regards the broker as his friend and is soon&amp;nbsp;over-trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if the speculator were smart enough to know at just which time he should over-trade, the practice would be justified. He may know at times when he could or should over-trade. But once acquiring the habit, very few Solicitors are smart enough to stop. They are carried away, and they lose that peculiar sense of balance so essential to success. They never think of the day when they will be wrong. But that day arrives. The easy money takes wing, and another speculator is&amp;nbsp;broke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never make any trade unless you know you can do so with financial&amp;nbsp;safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though more than a quarter-century has gone by since his death-by-suicide in 1940, .Jesse Livermore frequently comes to &amp;#8220;live&amp;#8221; today in conversations occurring in the board-rooms and the back-offices located along that man-made — and fascinating — canyon known as &amp;#8220;Wall&amp;nbsp;Street.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is quite understandable; for of all the colorful figures in stock market history Jesse Lauriston Livermore was the only operator who ever made and lost four stock market fortunes—each running into millions of dollars. What makes his roller- coaster financial past even more of a Wall Street wonder is the startling knowledge that every time Livermore went bankrupt, his &amp;#8220;hard-hearted&amp;#8221; creditors (in the main, conservative—and dispassionate—stockbrokers) promptly let him&amp;nbsp;off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tradition has it that the reason Livermore&amp;#8217;s creditors absolved him from his debts was simply that they couldn&amp;#8217;t afford to lose the commission business generated by his activities. But in any event such was his reputation that brokers and traders alike firmly believed Livermore to be the kind of genius who needed only a small bankroll, a stock ticker and a telephone to recoup his lost&amp;nbsp;millions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesse Livermore had more than just a reputation. He was a gifted man whose rare talents were busily employed for one unyielding purpose: the exciting business of speculation (profits from price&amp;nbsp;changes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand how Livermore came to be obsessed by the all-pervasive urge for wealth from price fluctuations, it is fitting to refer to his youth. Born in South Acton, Massachusetts, in 1877, young Jesse (son of a poor plain-dirt farmer) speedily resented the aches and callouses of bucolic&amp;nbsp;labors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hammered upon the forge of poverty, he began to dream of becoming rich—and famous. But most of all, he hungered to escape from the morass of the commonplace. He wanted to be a&amp;nbsp;somebody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To promote his ambitions, this farm boy at fifteen) ran off to Boston, where he wound up as a board boy in Paine Webber&amp;#8217;s office. There, for a few dollars a week, he diligently chalked the ever changing prices of stocks, bonds, and commodities onto a&amp;nbsp;blackboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, these prices and their changes were quite meaningless to Jesse Livermore. But when he came to realize that every time a price changed somebody made money, he became solidly hooked on the concept of mastering the forecasting of such changes. It was not too long before he put his theories to the test. At lunch hour he began to haunt the local bucket shops (emporiums where bets were made on the price action of stocks and commodities, without of course the actual purchase or sale of the involved items). And soon he found himself scalping small profits, while often being &amp;#8220;wiped out&amp;#8221; with small&amp;nbsp;losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day Jesse&amp;#8217;s supervisor warned him to stay away from those &amp;#8220;dens of iniquity&amp;#8221;; or else. Jesse chose the &amp;#8220;or else&amp;#8221;—and was promptly fired. Thus ended the first—and the last—job he ever had. For the next forty-eight years Livermore operated as a lone wolf, selfishly seeking his own&amp;nbsp;aggrandizement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after he was fired, Jesse did so well in the Boston bucket shows that he was banned from doing business in that city. Thereupon he went out of town, where he hurt the bucketshop operators so badly they dubbed him with the sobriquet, &amp;#8220;Boy&amp;nbsp;Wonder.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years after the turn of the century, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JC&lt;/span&gt; Livermore (then in his twenties) told himself he was ready for the &amp;#8220;big-time.&amp;#8221; Quietly he moved into New York City to prepare for his first big killing. This came along in the spring of 1906, when Livermore, on a tip from Boston Lawson, went short of Union&amp;nbsp;Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tall, slim, blond-haired—and as dignified-looking as a college president—the icy-eyed Mr. Livermore hardly batted an eyelash as the price of Union Pacific inexorably began to rise—and he began to be seriously squeezed. Obviously, the well-intentioned tip he had received seemed to be turning sour, but Livermore, trapped, with remarkable naïveté, stoically held his&amp;nbsp;ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily for Livermore, his first large-scale speculation worked out handsomely only because of a miracle. In April of 1906, the world was shocked by the San Francisco earthquake. The market broke badly. And two days thereafter, Livermore covered his shorts for a profit of more than a&amp;nbsp;quarter-million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The financially happy outcome of what at first appeared to be a tragedy from a tip taught Livermore his first important lesson: &amp;#8220;Never act on tips.&amp;#8221; The experience also taught him to seek a more sensible approach to the business of assuming market risk. He began to experiment along the lines of working out a thinking-man&amp;#8217;s stock market&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the decades that followed, Jesse Livermore sharpened his market tools, concentrating on an accurate method of price-analysis as a basis for price-prediction. Painfully, he learned from his own mistakes—and from the mistakes of other large- scale operators. For many years he stubbornly fought off publishers and tout-sheet operators alike, who pleaded with him to publish the secrets of his stock market methods. Meanwhile, Livermore patiently perfected his &amp;#8220;key&amp;#8221;—with the thought in mind that when it had proved to be successful at least 60% of the time he would then air it to the investment&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What motivated him, in 1939, to finally share his secrets with his fellow men was more than the money he hoped to realize from the sale of his book. For all during the years that Livermore worked on his Key system he yearned desperately to make his life meaningful: not only to himself, but also to his fellow Americans—people Who he knew played the stock market against professionals holding marked cards. And so Jesse Livermore wrote the revealing book that&amp;nbsp;follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man&amp;#8217;s most powerful weapon for self-betterment is the intelligent application of the lessons of personal experience, Jesse Livermore knew this just as he also knew that learning and knowledge are not sold in the same store. For almost fifty continuous years, day-in and day-out, he absorbed lessons from stock market activity. Trenchantly hee processed them inside his mind that any sharp Yankee trader would have been proud to own. And he set down his findings in a readable fashion—so that all could understand what he was trying to&amp;nbsp;say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not risk-takers reading this work will make money by applying the lessons of Jesse Livermore to today&amp;#8217;s markets is of course a debatable question. But every reader of this book will be enriched by its wisdom, its sensible &amp;#8220;rules&amp;#8221;—and the signposts in it pointing up the dangers to risk-capital as represented by changing prices. Chances are this book&amp;#8217;s readers will turn to it time and again, as if to an old friend, for its richly informative pages can often be comforting—and consoling. Assuredly, it will help make anyone&amp;#8217;s stock market approach more&amp;nbsp;pleasurable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MANY&lt;/span&gt; years of my life had been devoted to speculation before it dawned upon me that nothing new was happening in the stock market, that price movements were simply being repeated, that while there was variation in different stocks the general price pattern was the&amp;nbsp;same …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LIVERMORE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MARKET&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MANY&lt;/span&gt; years of my life had been devoted to speculation before it dawned upon me that nothing new was happening in the stock market, that price movements were simply being repeated, that while there was variation in different stocks the general price pattern was the&amp;nbsp;same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The urge fell upon me, as I have said, to keep price records that might be a guide to price movements. This I undertook with some zest. Then I began striving to find a point to start from in helping me to anticipate future movements. That was no easy&amp;nbsp;task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I can look back on those initial efforts and understand why they were not immediately fruitful. Having then a purely speculative mind, I was trying to devise a policy for trading in and out of the market all the time, catching the small intermediate moves. This was wrong, and in time I clearly recognized the&amp;nbsp;fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued keeping my records, confident that they had a genuine value which only awaited my discovery. At length the secret unfolded. The records told me plainly that they would do nothing for me in the way of intermediate movements. But if I would but use my eyes, I would see the formation of patterns that would foretell major&amp;nbsp;movements.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right then I determined to eliminate all the minor&amp;nbsp;movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By continued close study of the many records I had kept the realization struck me that the time element was vital in forming a correct opinion as to the approach of the really important movements. With renewed vigor I concentrated on that feature. What I wanted to discover was a method of recognizing what constituted the minor swings. I realized a market in a definite trend still had numerous intermediate oscillations. They had been confusing. They were no longer to be my&amp;nbsp;concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to find out what constituted the beginning of a Natural Reaction or a Natural Rally. So I began checking the distances of price movements. First I based my calculations on one point. That was no good. Then two points, and so on, until finally I arrived at a point that represented what I thought should constitute the beginning of a Natural Reaction or Natural&amp;nbsp;Rally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To simplify the picture I had printed a special sheet of paper, ruled in distinctive columns, and so arranged as to give me what I term my Map for Anticipating Future Movements. For each stock I use six columns. Prices are recorded in the columns as they occur. Each column has its&amp;nbsp;heading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First column is headed Secondary&amp;nbsp;Rally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second is headed Natural&amp;nbsp;Rally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third is headed Upward&amp;nbsp;Trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth is headed Downward&amp;nbsp;Trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifth is headed Natural&amp;nbsp;Reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixth is headed Secondary&amp;nbsp;Reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When figures are recorded in the Upward Trend column they are entered in black ink. In the next two columns to the left I insert the figures in pencil. When figures are recorded in the Downward Trend column they are entered in red ink, and in the next two columns to the right, the entries are also made in&amp;nbsp;pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus when recording the prices either in the Upward Trend column or in the Downward Trend column I am impressed with the actual trend at the time. Those figures in distinctive ink talk to me. The red ink or the black ink, used persistently, tells a story that is&amp;nbsp;unmistakable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the pencil remains in use I realize I am simply noting the natural oscillations. (In the reproduction of my records later on, bear in mind that the prices entered in light blue ink are those for which I use a pencil on my&amp;nbsp;sheets).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided a stock selling around $30.00 or higher would have to rally or react from an extreme point to the extent of approximately six points before I could recognize that a Natural Rally or Natural Reaction was in the making. This rally or reaction does not indicate that the trend of the market has changed its course. It simply indicates that the market is experiencing a natural movement. The trend is exactly the same as it was before the rally or reaction&amp;nbsp;occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would here explain that I do not take the action of a single stock as an indication that the trend has been positively changed for that group. Instead I take the combined action of two stocks in any group before I recognize the trend has definitely changed, hence the Key Price. By combining the prices and movements in these two stocks I arrive at what I call my Key Price. I find that an individual stock sometimes has a movement big enough to put it in my Upward Trend column or my Downward Trend column. But there is danger of being caught in a false movement by depending upon only one stock. The movement of the two stocks combined gives reasonable assurance. Thus, a positive change of the trend must be confirmed by the action of the Key&amp;nbsp;Price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me illustrate this Key Price method. Strictly adhering to the six-point movement to be used as a basis, you will note in my subsequent records that at times I record a price in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt;Steel if it only has had a move, let us say, of 5 points because you will find a corresponding movement in Bethlehem Steel, say, of 7 points. Taken together the price movements of the two stocks constitute the Key Price. This Key Price, then, totals twelve points or better, the proper distance&amp;nbsp;required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a recording point has been reached—that is, a move of six points average by each of the two stocks—I continue to set down in that same column the extreme price made any day, whenever it is higher than the last price recorded in the Upward Trend column or is lower than the last price recorded in the Downward Trend column. This goes on until a reverse movement starts. This later movement in the other direction will, of course, be based on the same six points average, or twelve points for the Key&amp;nbsp;Price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will notice that from then on I never deviate from those points. I make no exceptions. Nor do I make excuses, if the results are not exactly as I anticipated. Remember, these prices I set forth in my records are not my prices. These points have been determined by actual prices registered in the day&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be presumptuous for me to say I had arrived at the exact point from which my record of prices should start. It would also be misleading and insincere. I can only say that after years of checking and observation I feel I have arrived somewhere near a point that can be used as a basis for keeping records. From these records one can visualize a map useful in determining the approach of important price&amp;nbsp;movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone has said that Success rides upon the hour of&amp;nbsp;decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly success with this plan depends upon courage to act and act promptly when your records tell you to do so. There is no place for vacillation. You must train your mind along those lines. If you are going to wait upon someone else for explanations or reasons or reassurances, the time for action will have&amp;nbsp;escaped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give an illustration: After the rapid advance all stocks had following the declaration of war in Europe, a Natural Reaction occurred in the whole market. Then all the stocks in the four prominent groups recovered their reaction and all sold at new high prices—with the exception of the stocks in the Steel group. Anyone keeping records according to my method would have had their attention drawn very forcefully to the action of the Steel&amp;nbsp;stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there must have been a very good reason why the Steel stocks refused to continue their advance along with the other groups. There was a good reason! But at the time I did not know it, and I doubt very much that anyone could have given a valid explanation for it. However, anyone who had been recording prices would have realized by the action of the Steel stocks that the upward movement in the Steel group had ended. It was not until the middle of January 1910, four months later, that the public was given the facts and the action of the Steel stocks was explained. An announcement was made that during that time the English Government had disposed of over 100,000 shares of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; Steel, and in addition Canada had sold 20,000 shares. When that announcement was made the price of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt;Steel was 26 points lower than its high price attained in September 1939 and Bethlehem Steel was 29 points lower, whereas the prices of the other three prominent groups were off only 2.5 to 12.75 points from the high prices that were made at the same time the Steels made their&amp;nbsp;highs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incident proves the folly of trying to find out &amp;#8220;a good reason&amp;#8221; why you should buy or sell a given stock. If you wait until you have the reason given you, you will have missed the opportunity of having acted at the proper&amp;nbsp;time! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only reason an investor or speculator should ever want to have pointed out to him is the action if the market itself. Whenever the market does not act right or in the way it should — that is reason enough for you to change your opinion and change it immediately. Remember: there is always a reason for a stock acting the way it does. But also remember: the chances are that you will not become acquainted with that reason until some time in the future, when it is too late to act on it&amp;nbsp;profitably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I repeat that the formula does not provide points whereby you can make additional trades, with assurance, on intermediate fluctuations which occur during a major move. The intent is to catch the major moves, to indicate the beginning and the end of movements of importance. And for such purpose you will find the formula of singular value if faithfully pursued. It should, perhaps, also be repeated that this formula is designed for active stocks selling above an approximate price of 30. While the same basic principles are of course operative in anticipating the market action of all stocks, certain adjustments in the formula must be made in considering the very low-priced&amp;nbsp;issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing complicated about it. The various phases will be absorbed quickly and with easy understanding by those who are&amp;nbsp;interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next chapter is given the exact reproduction of my records, with full explanation of the figures which I have&amp;nbsp;entered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is my purpose in these chapters to lay down some general trading principles. Later on there will be specific explanation of my formula for combining time element and&amp;nbsp;price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is my purpose in these chapters to lay down some general trading principles. Later on there will be specific explanation of my formula for combining time element and&amp;nbsp;price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In consideration of these general trading principles it should be said that too many speculators buy or sell impulsively, acquiring their entire line at almost one price. That is wrong and&amp;nbsp;dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us suppose that you want to buy 500 shares of a stock. Start by buying 100 shares. Then if the market advances buy another 100 shares and so on. But each succeeding purchase must be at a higher price than the previous&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That same rule should be applied in selling short. Never make an additional sale unless it is at a lower price than the previous sale. By following this rule you will come nearer being on the right side than by any other method with which I am familiar. The reason for this procedure is that your trades have at all times shown you a profit. The fact that your trades do show you a profit is proof you are&amp;nbsp;right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under my trading practice you first would size up the situation in regard to a particular stock. Next it is important to determine at what price you should allow yourself to enter the market. Study your book of price records, study carefully the movements of the past few weeks. When your chosen stock reaches the point you had previously decided it should reach if the move is going to start in earnest, that is the time to make your first&amp;nbsp;commitment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having made that commitment, decide definitely the amount of money you are willing to risk should your calculations be wrong. You may make one or two commitments on this theory and lose. But by being consistent and never failing to re-enter the market again whenever your Pivotal Point is reached, you cannot help but be in when the real move does occur. You simply cannot be out of&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But careful timing is essential &amp;#8230; impatience&amp;nbsp;costly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you how I once missed a million dollar profit through impatience and careless timing. I almost want to turn my face away in embarrassment when I tell&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many years ago I became strongly bullish on Cotton. I had formed a definite opinion that Cotton was in for a big rise. But as frequently happens the market itself was not ready to start. No sooner had I reached my conclusion, however, than I had to poke my nose into&amp;nbsp;Cotton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My initial play was for 20,000 bales, purchased at the market. This order ran the dull market up fifteen points. Then, after my last 100 bales had been bought, the market proceeded to slip back in twenty-four hours to the price at which it had been selling when I started buying. There it slept for a number of days. Finally, in disgust, I sold out, taking a loss of around $30,000, including commissions. Naturally my last 100 bales were sold at the lowest price of the&amp;nbsp;reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days later the market appealed to me again. I could not dismiss it from my mind, nor could I revise my original belief that it was in for a big move. So I re-bought my 20,000 bales. The same thing happened. Up jumped the market on my buying order and, after that, right back down it came with a thud. Waiting irked me, so once more I sold my holdings, the last lot at the lowest price&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This costly operation I repeated five times in six weeks, losing on each operation between $25,000 to $30,000. I became disgusted with myself. Here I had chipped away almost $200,000 with not even a semblance of satisfaction. So I gave my manager an order to have the Cotton ticker removed before my arrival next morning. I did not want to be tempted to look at the Cotton market any more. It was too depressing, a mood not conducive to the clear thinking which is required at all times in the field of&amp;nbsp;speculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what happened? Two days after I had the ticker removed and had lost all interest in Cotton, the market started up, and it never stopped until it had risen 500 points. In that remarkable rise it had but one reaction as great as 40&amp;nbsp;points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had thus lost one of the most attractive and soundest plays I had ever figured out. There were two basic reasons. First, I lacked the patience to wait until the psychological time had arrived, pricewise, to begin my operation. I had known that if Cotton ever sold up to 12.50 cents a pound it would be on its way to much higher prices. But no, I did not have the will power to wait. I thought I must make a few extra dollars quickly, before Cotton reached the buying point, and I acted before the market was ripe. Not only did I lose around $200,000 in actual money, but a profit of $1,000,000. For my original plan, well fixed in mind, contemplated the accumulation of 100,000 bales after the Pivotal Point had been passed. I could not have missed making a profit of 200 points or more on that&amp;nbsp;move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, to allow myself to become angry and disgusted with the Cotton market just because I had used bad judgment was not consistent with good speculative procedure. My loss was due wholly to lack of patience in awaiting the proper time to back up a preconceived opinion and&amp;nbsp;plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have long since learned, as all should learn, not to make excuses when wrong. Just admit it and try to profit by it. We all know when we ire wrong. The market will tell the speculator when he is wrong, because he is losing money. When he first realizes he is wrong is the time to clear out, take his losses, try to keep smiling, study the record to determine the cause of his error, and await the next big opportunity. It is the net result over a period of time in which he is&amp;nbsp;interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sense of knowing when you are wrong even before the market tells you becomes, in time, rather highly developed. It is a subconscious tip-off. It is a signal from within that is based on knowledge of past market performances. Sometimes it is an advance agent of the trading formula. Let me explain more&amp;nbsp;fully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the big Bull Market in the late twenties, there were times when I owned fairly large amounts of different stocks, which I held for a considerable period of time. During this period I never felt uneasy over my position whenever Natural Reactions occurred from time to&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sooner or later there would be a time when, after the market closed, I would become restive. That night I would find sound sleep difficult. Something would jog me into consciousness and I would awaken and begin thinking about the market. Next morning I would be afraid, almost, to look at the newspapers. Something sinister would seem impending. But perhaps I would find everything rosy and my strange feelings apparently unjustified. The market might open higher. Its action would be perfect. It would be right at the peak of its movement. One could almost laugh at his restless night. But I have learned to suppress such&amp;nbsp;laughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For next day the story would be strikingly different. No disastrous news, but simply one of those sudden market turning points after a prolonged movement in one direction. On that day I would be genuinely disturbed. I would be faced with the rapid liquidation of a large line. The day before, I could have liquidated my entire position within two points of the extreme movement. But today, what a vast&amp;nbsp;difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe many operators have had similar experiences with that curious inner mind which frequently flashes the danger signal when everything marketwise is aglow with hope. It is just one of those peculiar quirks that develops from long study and association with the&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly, I am always suspicious of the inner mind tip-off and usually prefer to apply the cold scientific formula. But the fact remains that on many occasions I have benefited to a high degree by giving attention to a feeling of great uneasiness at a time when I seemed to be sailing smooth&amp;nbsp;seas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This curious sidelight on trading is interesting because the feeling of danger ahead seems to be pronounced only among those sensitive to market action, those whose thoughts have followed a scientific pattern in seeking to determine price movements. To the rank and file of persons who speculate the bullish or bearish feeling is simply based on something overheard or some published&amp;nbsp;comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind that of the millions who speculate in all markets only a few devote their entire time to speculation. With an overwhelming majority it is only a hit-and-miss affair, and a costly one. Even among intelligent business and professional men and retired men it is a sideline to which they give small attention. Most of them would not be trading in stocks if at some time a good tip had not been passed along by a broker or customers&amp;#8217;&amp;nbsp;man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now and then someone begins trading because he has a hot inside tip from a friend in the inner councils of a large corporation. Let me here relate a hypothetical&amp;nbsp;case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You meet your corporation friend at luncheon or at a dinner party. You talk general business for a time. Then you ask about Great Shakes Corporation. Well, business is fine. It is just turning the corner and the future outlook is brilliant. Yes, the stock is attractive at this&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;A very good buy, indeed,&amp;#8221; he will say and perhaps in all sincerity. &amp;#8220;Our earnings are going to be excellent, in fact better than for a number of years past. Of course you recall, Jim, what the stock sold for the last time we had a&amp;nbsp;boom.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are enthused and lose little time in acquiring&amp;nbsp;shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each statement shows better business than during the last quarter. Extra dividends are declared. The stock moves up and up. And you drift into pleasant paper profit dreams. But in the course of time the company&amp;#8217;s business begins slipping dreadfully. You are not apprised of the fact. You only know the price of the stock has tobogganed. You hasten to call your&amp;nbsp;friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Yes&amp;#8221; he will say, &amp;#8220;the stock has had quite a break. But it seems to be only temporary. Volume of business is down somewhat. Having learned that fact the bears are attacking the stock. It&amp;#8217;s mostly short&amp;nbsp;selling.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He may follow along with a lot of other platitudes, concealing the true reason. For he and his associates doubtless own a lot of the stock and have been selling as much and as rapidly as the market would take it since those first definite signs of a serious slump in their business appeared. To tell you the truth would simply invite your competition and perhaps the competition of your mutual friends in his selling campaign. It becomes almost a case of&amp;nbsp;self-preservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is plain to see why your friend, the industrialist on the inside, can easily tell you when to buy. But he cannot and will not tell you when to sell. That would be equivalent almost to treason to his&amp;nbsp;associates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I urge you always to keep a little notebook with you. Jot down interesting market information: thoughts that may be helpful in the future; ideas that may be re-read from time to time; little personal observations you have made on price movements. On the first page of this little book I suggest you write—no, better print—it in ink: &amp;#8220;Beware of inside information - all inside&amp;nbsp;information.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It cannot be said too often that in speculation and investment, success comes only to those who work for it. No one is going to hand you a lot of easy money. It is like the story of the penniless tramp. His hunger gave him the audacity to enter a restaurant and order &amp;#8220;a big, luscious, thick, juicy steak,&amp;#8221; and, he added to the colored waiter, &amp;#8220;tell your boss to make it snappy.&amp;#8221; In a moment the waiter ambled back and whined: &amp;#8220;De boss say if he had dat steak here he&amp;#8217;d eat it&amp;nbsp;hisself.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if there was any easy money lying around, no one would be forcing it into your&amp;nbsp;pocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WHENEVER&lt;/span&gt; I have had the patience to wait for the market to arrive at what I call a &amp;#8220;Pivotal Point&amp;#8221; before I started to trade, I have always made money in my&amp;nbsp;operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I then commenced my play just at the psychological time at the …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PIVOTAL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;POINT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WHENEVER&lt;/span&gt; I have had the patience to wait for the market to arrive at what I call a &amp;#8220;Pivotal Point&amp;#8221; before I started to trade, I have always made money in my&amp;nbsp;operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I then commenced my play just at the psychological time at the beginning of a move. I never had a loss to worry about for the simple reason that I acted promptly and started to accumulate my line right at the time my guide told me to do so. All I had to do thereafter was just sit tight and let the market run its course, knowing if I did so, the action of the market itself would give me in due time the signal to take my profits. And whenever I had the nerve and the patience to wait for the signal, it invariably did just&amp;nbsp;that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has always been my experience that I never benefited much from a move if I did not get in at somewhere near the beginning of that move. And the reason is that I missed the backlog of profit which is very necessary to provide the courage and patience to sit through a move until the end comes—and to stay through any minor reactions or rallies which were bound to occur from time to time before the movement had completed its&amp;nbsp;course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as markets in time will give you a positive tip when to get in—if you have patience to wait— they will just as surely give you a tip-off when to get out. &amp;#8220;Rome was not built in a day,&amp;#8221; and no real movement of importance ends in one day or in one week. It takes time for it to run its logical course. It is significant that a large part of a market movement occurs in the last forty-eight hours of a play, and that is the most important time to be in&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example: Take a stock which has been in a Downward Trend for quite some time and reaches a low point of 40. Then it has a quick rally in a few days to 45, then it backs and fills for a week in a range of a few points, and then it starts to extend its rally until it reaches 49.50. The market becomes dull and inactive for a few days. Then one day it becomes active again and goes down 3 or 4 points, and keeps on going down until it reaches a price near its Pivotal Point of 40. Right here is the time the market should be watched carefully, because if the stock is really going to resume its Downward Trend in earnest it should sell below its Pivotal Point of 40 by three points or more before it has another rally of importance. If it fails to pierce 40 it is an indication to buy as soon as it rallies 3 points from the low price made on that reaction. If the 40 point has been pierced but not by the proper extent of 3 points, then it should be bought as soon as it advances to&amp;nbsp;43.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If either one of these two things happen, you will find, in the majority of cases, that it marks the beginning of a new trend, and if the trend is going to be confirmed in a positive manner, it will continue to advance and reach a price over the Pivotal point of 49.50—by 3 points or&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not use the words &amp;#8220;bullish&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;bearish in defining trends of the market, because I think so many people, when they hear the words &amp;#8220;bullish or &amp;#8220;bearish&amp;#8221; spoken of marketwise immediately think that is the course the market is going to take for a very long&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well-defined trends of that kind do not occur very often—only once in about four or five years— but during that time there are many well-defined trends which last for a comparatively short time. I consequently use the words &amp;#8220;Upward Trend&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Downward Trend,&amp;#8221; because they fully express what is going on at that specific time. Moreover, if you make a purchase because you think the market is going into an Upward Trend, and then a few weeks later come to the conclusion the market is heading into a Downward Trend, you will find it much easier to accept the reversal in trend than if you had a confirmed opinion that the market was definitely in a &amp;#8220;bullish&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;bearish&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Livermore Method of recording prices in conjunction with the time element is the result of over thirty years of study of principles which would serve me in forming a basic guide for the next important&amp;nbsp;movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After making my first record, I found it did not help me to any great extent. Weeks later I had a new thought which aroused me to fresh endeavors, only to find out that, while it was an improvement over the first one, it still did not give me the desired information. Successively new thoughts would come to mind, and I would make a set of new records. Gradually, after making many of these, I began to develop ideas I did not have before, and each succeeding record I made began to shape itself into better form. But from the time I started to merge the time element with price movements, my records began to talk to me! Each record thereafter I put together in a different way, and these eventually enabled me to ascertain Pivotal Points and in turn demonstrate how to use them profitably marketwise. I have changed my calculations since then a number of times, but these records today are set up in such a way that they can talk to you also— if you but let&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a speculator can determine the Pivotal Point of a stock and interpret the action at that point, he may make a commitment with the positive assurance of being right from the start. Many years ago I began profiting from the simplest type of Pivotal Point trades. Frequently I had observed that when a stock sold at 50. 100. 200 and even 300, a fast and straight movement almost invariably occurred after such points were&amp;nbsp;passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first attempt to profit on these Pivotal Points was in the old Anaconda stock. The instant it sold at 100, I placed an order to buy 4,000 shares. The order was not completed until the stock crossed 105 a few minutes later. That day it sold up about ten points more and the next day had another remarkable bulge. With only a few normal reactions of seven or eight points the advance continued to well over 150 in a short period of time. At no time was the Pivotal Point of 100 in&amp;nbsp;danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From then on I rarely missed a big play where there was a Pivotal Point on which to work. When Anaconda sold at 200, I repeated my successful play and did the same thing again when it sold at 300. But on that occasion it did not carry through to the proper extent. It sold only to 302.75. Plainly it was flashing the danger signal. So I sold out my 8,000 shares, being fortunate enough to receive 300 a share for 5,000 shares and 299 for 1,500 shares. The 6,500 shares were sold in less than two minutes. But it took twenty-five minutes more to sell the remaining 1,500 shares in 100 and 200 lots down to 298.75. where the stock closed. I felt confident that if the stock broke below 300, it would have a swift downward movement. Next morning there was excitement. Anaconda was way down in London, opened in New York substantially lower, and within a few days was selling at&amp;nbsp;225.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind when using Pivotal Points in anticipating market movements, that if the stock does not perform as it should, after crossing the Pivotal Point, this is a danger signal which must be heeded. As shown in the above incident, the action of Anaconda, after crossing 100, entirely different than its action above 100 and 200, respectively. On those occasions there was a very fast advance of at least 10 to 15 points right after the Pivotal Point had been crossed. But this time, instead of the stock being hard to buy, the market was being supplied with quantities of it to such an extent, the stock simply could not continue its advance. Therefore the action of the stock right above 300 clearly showed it had become a dangerous stock to own. It clearly showed that what usually happens when a stock crosses its Pivotal Point was not going to be the case this&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another occasion I recall waiting three weeks before starting to buy Bethlehem Steel. On April 7, 1915, it had reached its highest Price on record: 87.75. Having observed that stocks passing a Pivotal Point gained rapidly, and being confident that Bethlehem Steel would go through 100, on April 8 placed my first order to buy and accumulated my line from 99 up to 99.75. The same day the stock sold up to a high of 117. It never halted in its upward flight except for minor reactions until April 13, or five days later, when it sold at a high of 155, a breath-taking rise. This again illustrates the rewards which go to the person who has the patience to wait for and take advantage of the Pivotal&amp;nbsp;Points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I was not through with Bethlehem. I repeated the operation at the 200 point, at the 300 point, and again at the dizzy Peak of 400. Nor had I finished, for I had anticipated what would happen in a bear market, when the stock broke the Pivotal Points on the way down. I learned the main thing was to watch the follow-through. I found it was an easy matter to turn around and get out of a position, when vitality was kicking after a stock crossed the&amp;nbsp;line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, every time I lost patience and failed to await the Pivotal Points and fiddled around for some easy profits in the meantime, I would lose&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since those days there have been various split- ups in shares of high-priced stocks and, accordingly, opportunities such as those I have just reviewed do not occur so often. Nevertheless, there are other ways by which one can determine Pivotal Points. For instance, let us say that a new stock has been listed in the last two or three years and its high was 20, or any other figure, and that such a price was made two or three years ago. If something favorable happens in connection with the company, and the stock starts upward, usually it is a safe play to buy the minute it touches a brand-new&amp;nbsp;high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stock may be brought out at 50, 60 or 70 a share, sell off 20 points or so, and then hold between the high and low for a year or two. Then if it ever sells below the previous low, that stock is likely to be in for a tremendous drop. Why? Because something must have gone wrong with the affairs of the&amp;nbsp;company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By keeping stock price records and taking into consideration the time element, you will be able to find many Pivotal Points on which to make a commitment for a fast movement. But to educate yourself to trade on these points requires patience. You must devote time to the study of records, made and entered in the record-book only by yourself, and in making notes at which prices the Pivotal Points will be&amp;nbsp;reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fascinating almost beyond belief, the study of Pivotal Points is, you will find, a golden field for personal research. You will derive from successful trades based on your own judgment a singular pleasure and satisfaction. You will discover that profits made in this way are immensely more gratifying than any which could possibly come from the tips or guidance of someone else. If you make your own discovery, trade your own way, exercise patience, watch for the danger signals, you will develop a proper trend of thinking. In the last chapters of this book I explain in detail my own method of determining the more complex Pivotal Points in conjunction with the Livermore Market&amp;nbsp;Method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few people ever make money by trading on the occasional tips or recommendations of others. Many beg for information and then don&amp;#8217;t know how to use it. At a dinner party one night a lady kept pestering me beyond endurance for some market advice. In one of those weak moments I told her to buy some Cerro de Pasco which that day had crossed a Pivotal Point. From the next morning&amp;#8217;s opening the stock advanced 15 points during the next week with only trifling reactions. Then the action of the stock gave forth a danger signal. I recalled the lady&amp;#8217;s inquiry and hastened to have Mrs. Livermore telephone her to sell. Fancy my surprise to learn that she had not yet bought the stock as she first wanted to see whether my information was correct. So wags the world of market&amp;nbsp;tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities frequently offer attractive Pivotal Points. Cocoa is traded in on the New York Cocoa Exchange. During most years the movements in this commodity do not offer many speculative inducements. Nevertheless, in making speculation a business, one automatically keeps an eye on all markets for the big&amp;nbsp;opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the year 1931 the high price of the December option in Cocoa was made in February at 6.23, the low was made in October at 1.28. In 1935 the high price was made in February at 5.74, the low in June at 4.54. The low price in 19:36 made in March at 5.13. But in August of that year for some reason the Cocoa market became a very different market. Great activity developed. When Cocoa sold that month at a price of 6.88. it was far beyond the highest price of the previous two years and above its last two Pivotal&amp;nbsp;Points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September it sold at a high of 7.51; in October the high was 8.70; in November it was 10.80; in December 11.10; and in January 1937 it made an extreme high of 12.86, having recorded a rise of 600 points in a period of five months with only a few minor normal&amp;nbsp;reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously there was a very good reason for this rapid rise, as only normal movements occur year in and year out. The reason was a severe shortage in the supply of Cocoa. Those closely watching Pivotal Points found a splendid opportunity in the Cocoa&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is when you set down prices in your record book and observe the patterns that the prices begin to talk to you. All of a sudden you realize that the picture you are making is acquiring a certain form. It is striving to make clear a situation that is building up. It suggests that you go back over your records and see what the last movement of importance was under a similar- set of conditions. It is telling you that by careful analysis and good judgment you will be able to form an opinion. The price pattern reminds you that every movement of importance is but a repetition of similar price movements, that just as soon as you familiarize yourself with the actions of the past, you will be able to anticipate and act correctly and profitably upon forthcoming&amp;nbsp;movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to emphasize the fact that I do not consider these records perfection, except as they serve me. I do know a basis is there for anticipating future movements and if anyone will study these records, keeping them themselves, they cannot fail to profit by it in their&amp;nbsp;operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would not surprise me if the persons who in the future follow my methods of keeping these records get even more out of them than I have. This statement is based on the premise that, whereas I arrived at my conclusions some time ago, as a result of my record analysis, those beginning to apply this method may very readily discover new points of value that I have missed. I would further clarify this by stating that I have not looked for any further points, because, applying it as I have for some time past, it has entirely served my personal purpose. Someone else, however, may develop from this basic method new ideas which, when applied, will enhance the value of my basic method for their&amp;nbsp;purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they are able to do so, you may rest assured that I will not be jealous of their&amp;nbsp;success!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the preceding chapter, I related how by not exercising patience I missed being in on a play that would have netted a handsome profit. Now I shall describe an instance where I bided my time and the result of waiting for the psychological&amp;nbsp;moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 1924, Wheat had reached a price that I term a Pivotal Point, so I stepped in with an initial buy order for five million bushels. At that time the Wheat market was an extremely large one, so that the execution of an order of this size had no appreciable effect on the price. Let me here indicate that a similar order given in a single stock would have been the equivalent of 50,000&amp;nbsp;shares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately after the execution of this order the market became dull for a few days, but it never declined below the Pivotal Point. The market then started up again and went a few cents higher than on the previous move, from which point it had a Natural Reaction and remained dull for a few days after which it resumed its&amp;nbsp;advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as it pierced the next Pivotal Point, I gave an order to buy another five million bushels. This was executed at an average price of 1.5 cents above the Pivotal Point, which clearly indicated&amp;nbsp;to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;me that the market was working itself into a strong position. Why? Because it was much more difficult to accumulate the second five million bushels than the&amp;nbsp;first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ensuing day, instead of the market reacting as it had after the first order, it advanced 3 cents, which is exactly what it should have done if my analysis of the market was correct. From then on there developed what might be termed a real Bull Market. By that I mean an extensive movement had begun which I calculated would extend over a period of several months. I did not, however, fully realize the full possibilities which lay ahead. Then, when I had a 25 cents per bushel profit, I cashed in—and sat back and saw the market advance 20 cents more within a few&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right then I realized I had made a great mistake. Why had I been afraid of losing something I never really had? I was altogether too anxious to convert a paper profit into actual cash, when I should have been patient and had the courage to play the deal out to the end. I knew that in due time, when the upward trend had reached its Pivotal Point, I would be given a danger signal in ample&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I therefore decided to re-enter the market and went back at an average of 25 cents higher than that at which I had sold my first commitment. At first I had only the courage to make one commitment, which represented 50% of what I had originally sold out. However, from there on I stayed with it until the danger signal gave warning. On January 28, 1925. May Wheat sold at the high price of $2.05 7/8 per bushel. On February 11 it had reacted to&amp;nbsp;$1.77. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During all this phenomenal advance in Wheat, there was another commodity, Rye, which had had an even more spectacular advance than Wheat. However, the Rye market is a very small one compared to Wheat, so that the execution of a comparatively small order to buy would create a decidedly rapid&amp;nbsp;advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the above-described operations, I frequently had I large personal commitment in the market, and there were others who had equally as large commitments. One other operator was reputed to have accumulated a line of several million bushels of futures, in addition to many millions of bushels of cash wheat, and in order to help his position in Wheat to have also accumulated large amounts of cash Rye. He was also reputed to have used the Rye market at times when Wheat began to waver by placing orders to buy&amp;nbsp;Rye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated, the Rye market being small and narrow in comparison, the execution of any sizable buying order immediately caused a rapid advance, and its reflection on Wheat prices was necessarily very marked. Whenever this method was used the public would rush in to buy Wheat, with the result that that commodity sold into new high&amp;nbsp;territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This procedure went on successfully until the major movement reached its end. During the time Wheat was having its reaction Rye reacted in a corresponding way, declining from its high price made on January 28, 1925, of $1.82 1/4 cents, to a Price of $154, being a reaction of 281/4 cents against a reaction of 28 3/8 cents in Wheat,. On March 2, May Wheat had recovered to within 3 cents of its previous high, selling at $2.02, but Rye did not recover its decline in the same vigorous way as Wheat had, only being able to make a price of $l.70 1/8 which was 12 1/8 points below its previous high&amp;nbsp;Price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching the market closely, as I was at that time, I was struck forcibly by the fact that something was wrong, since, during all the big Bull Market. Rye had inevitably preceded the advance in Wheat. Now, instead of becoming a leader of the Grain Pit in its advance, it was lagging. Wheat had already recovered most of its entire abnormal reaction, whereas Rye failed to do so by about 12 cents per bushel. This action was something entirely&amp;nbsp;new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I set to work analyzing, with a view to ascertaining the reason why Rye was not participating in the recovery proportionately to Wheat. The reason soon became evident. The public had a great interest in the Wheat market but none in Rye. If that was a one-man market, why, all of a sudden, was he neglecting it? I concluded that he either had no more interest in Rye and was out, or was so heavily involved in both markets that he was no longer in a position to make further&amp;nbsp;commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided then and there that it made no difference whether he was in or out of Rye—that eventually the result would be the same marketwise, so I put my theory to&amp;nbsp;test. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last quotation on Rye was $1.697 bid, and having determined to find out the real position in Rye, I gave an order to sell 200,000 bushels &amp;#8220;at the market.&amp;#8221; When I placed that order Wheat was quoted at $2.02. Before the order was executed Rye had sold off 3 cents per bushel, and two minutes after the order was filled it was back at&amp;nbsp;$1.687.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered by the execution of that order that there were not many orders under the market. However, I was not yet certain what might develop after, so I gave an order to sell another 200,000 bushels, with the same result—down it went 3 cents before the order was executed, but after the execution it only rallied 1 cent against the 2 cents&amp;nbsp;previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still entertained some doubt as to the correctness of my analysis of the position of the market, so I gave a third order to sell 200,000 bushels, with the same result—the market again went down, but this time there was no rally. It kept on going down on its own&amp;nbsp;momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the tip-off for which I was watching and waiting. If someone held a big position in the Wheat market and did not for some reason or other protect the Rye market (and what his reason was did not concern me), I felt confident that he would not or could not support the Wheat market. So I immediately gave an order to sell 5,000,000 bushels of May Wheat &amp;#8220;at the market.&amp;#8221; It was sold from $2.01 to $1.99. That night it closed around $1.97 and Rye at $1.65. I was glad the last part of my order was completed below $2.00 because the $2.00 price was a Pivotal Point, and the market having broken through that Pivotal Point, I felt sure of my position. Naturally I never had any worries about that&amp;nbsp;trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days later I bought my Rye in, which I had sold only as a testing operation to ascertain the position of the Wheat market, and chalked up a profit of $250,000.00 on the&amp;nbsp;transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I kept on selling Wheat until I had accumulated a short line of fifteen million bushels. March 16, May Wheat closed at $1.645 and the next morning Liverpool was 3 cents lower than due, which on a parity basis should cause our market to open around&amp;nbsp;$1.61.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I did something that experience taught me I should not do, namely, give an order at a specified price before the market opened. But temptation submerged my better judgment and I gave an order to buy five million bushels at $1.61, which was 3-4 cents below the previous night&amp;#8217;s close. The opening showed a price range of $1.61 to $1.54. Thereupon I said to myself: &amp;#8220;It serves you right for breaking a rule you know you should not have broken.&amp;#8221; But again it was a case of human instinct overcoming innate judgment. I would have bet anything that my order would be executed at the stipulated Price of $1.61, which was the high of the opening price&amp;nbsp;range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, when I saw the price of $1.54. I gave another order to buy five million bushels. Immediately thereafter I received a report: &amp;#8220;bought five million bushels May Wheat at&amp;nbsp;$1.53.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again I entered my order for another five million bushels. In less than one minute the report came; &amp;#8220;Bought five million bushels at $1.53,&amp;#8221; which I naturally assumed was the price at which my third order had been filled. I then asked for a report on my first order. The following was handed to&amp;nbsp;me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The first five million bushels reported to you filled your first&amp;nbsp;order.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The second five million bushels reported filled your second&amp;nbsp;order.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Here is the report on your third order:
*  3.5 million bushels at 153.00
* 1 million bushels at 153.12
* 500,000 bushels at&amp;nbsp;153.25.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The low price that day as $151 and next day Wheat was back to $1.64. That was the first time in my experience that I ever received an execution of a limited order of that nature. I had given an order to buy five million bushels at $1.61&amp;#8212;the market opened at my bid price of $1.61 to 7 cents lower, $ 1.54, which represented a difference of&amp;nbsp;$350,000.00.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A short time later I had occasion to be in Chicago, and asked the man who was in charge of placing my orders how it happened that I received such excellent execution of my first limited order. He informed me that he happened to know there was an order in the market to sell thirty-five million bushels &amp;#8220;at the market.&amp;#8221; That being the case, he realized that no matter how low the market might open there would be plenty of Wheat for sale at the lower opening price after the opening, so he merely waited until the opening range and then put in my order at the&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stated that had it not been for my orders reaching the Pit as they did, the market would have had a tremendous break from the opening&amp;nbsp;level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final net result of these transactions showed a profit of over&amp;nbsp;$3,000,000.00.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This illustrates the value of having a short interest in speculative markets because the short interests become willing buyers, and those willing buyers act as a much-needed stabilizer in times of&amp;nbsp;panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today operations of this kind are not possible, as the Commodities Exchange Administration limits the size of any one individual&amp;#8217;s position in the grain market to two million bushels, and while there has been no limit placed on the size of anyone&amp;#8217;s commitment in the stock market, it is equally impossible for any one operator to establish a sizable short position under the existing rules in respect to selling&amp;nbsp;short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I therefore believe the day of the old speculator has gone. His place will be taken in the future by the semi-investor, who, while not able to make such large sums in the market quickly, will be able to make more money over a given period and be able to keep it. I hold the firm belief that the future successful semi-investor will only operate at the psychological time and will eventually realize a much larger percentage out of every minor or major movement than the purely speculative-minded operator ever&amp;nbsp;did.&lt;/p&gt;
