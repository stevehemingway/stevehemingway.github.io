into his head. Read more informative articles&amp;nbsp;today!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;How to Improve Your Home Workspace Without Robbing the Piggy&amp;nbsp;Bank&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With so many people working from home nowadays, it has become common
practice to think of ways to upgrade a workspace without spending too
much - assuming you&amp;#8217;re thrifty at heart. Here are some tips on how to
cut down on your expenditure in this regard, presented to you below &lt;a href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/"&gt;by
Wishful Thinking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="finding-the-ideal-space"&gt;Finding the ideal&amp;nbsp;space&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your current home lacks the proper facilities for a workspace, then
you may need to find something more accommodating. Exploring online
listings should indicate what&amp;#39;s available regarding how big of a space
you require to be able to work remotely -&amp;nbsp;comfortably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where to&amp;nbsp;work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If moving out of your current home is not an option, it would be in your
best interest to find an existing area to work in peace and quiet.
HomeServe notes that &lt;a href="https://www.homeserve.com/en-us/blog/how-to/home-office-ideas/"&gt;the bedroom is a popular
choice&lt;/a&gt;
because it is usually quiet and private during the daytime hours, making
it an ideal place to set up a desk and workstation for those who prefer
to work&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wherever you decide to work, you should give some serious
&lt;a href="https://blog.fads.co.uk/inspiration/build-your-home-office-for-less-than-500/"&gt;consideration to the budget you have
available&lt;/a&gt;
and the design you have in mind for your home office. Keep in mind that
such home &lt;a href="https://www.redfin.com/guides/how-to-increase-your-home-appraisal-value-now"&gt;improvements and
updates&lt;/a&gt;
can pay off in time as your property value will certainly get a nice&amp;nbsp;boost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Boost&amp;nbsp;efficiency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a few tweaks, you can be just as productive in a home office as you
would in a traditional office. Fenesta points out that &lt;a href="https://www.fenesta.com/blog/importance-of-having-light-in-your-home-office"&gt;exposure to
natural
light&lt;/a&gt;
can keep you more alert - and you can save on your monthly energy costs.
If you&amp;#39;re looking for a change, consider painting the room or at least
the walls around your workspace a shade of green for a calming effect on
the&amp;nbsp;psyche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get a similar &lt;a href="https://www.ambius.co.uk/benefits-of-indoor-plants/"&gt;effect from having
plants&lt;/a&gt;
around the office, and they&amp;#39;ll even help you breathe better.
Complementary lighting can help to enhance the ambiance of your homework
space should clients come around. Your decor is really up to you at the
end of the day and should be according to your personal&amp;nbsp;taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tbsg.co.uk/blog/benefits-of-ergonomic-office-furniture-p6zd5"&gt;A work
chair&lt;/a&gt;
that is either too soft or too rigid can be a major source of pain and
inefficiency in the workplace. The initial investment in a high-quality
chair may be larger, but it will serve you well for many years by
providing the necessary lumbar support at work. Other types of furniture
that you might find to be useful in your workspace could include a
sturdy desk, a desk lamp, a sofa for when clients come around, elegant
mirrors, additional lampstands, and a coffee&amp;nbsp;table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, expenses like these can tend to add up. &lt;a href="https://safesmartfamily.com/"&gt;Click here for more
information&lt;/a&gt; before
committing to a significant&amp;nbsp;purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, there are many ways to set up a functional workplace
without breaking the bank. Looking at rental options might just spark an
idea to find bigger premises and could be an option if you don&amp;#8217;t want to
waste time upgrading an area that might not end up working to your
advantage&amp;nbsp;anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prospect of starting a handyman business holds a certain allure, not
least because of its vast potential for growth and profitability. A
successful foray into this field hinges on meticulous planning and an
intimate understanding of the trade&amp;#8217;s nuances. To excel, an entrepreneur
must lay a solid foundation from which to build their brand, reputation,
and operational acumen. Here, &lt;a href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Wishful
Thinking&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will dissect the crucial
steps aspiring business owners must take to carve out their niche in the
handyman&amp;nbsp;industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invest in the Tools of the&amp;nbsp;Trade&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cornerstone of any handyman business is the arsenal of tools at
one’s disposal. Professionals know that subpar equipment can derail even
the most basic tasks, compromising work quality and client trust.
Therefore, allocating funds for &lt;a href="https://getjobber.com/academy/handyman/handyman-tools/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;durable, high-performance
tools&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; not
only prepares one for a diverse range of jobs but also stands as an
investment in the business’s reputation for reliability and&amp;nbsp;excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize Legal&amp;nbsp;Compliance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Navigating the legalities of starting a handyman business is
non-negotiable. From &lt;a href="https://www.zenbusiness.com/blog/who-needs-a-general-contractors-license/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;securing the appropriate
licenses&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
to understanding zoning laws, compliance safeguards against unforeseen
legal complications. Prospective business owners must allocate time to
comprehensively understand and adhere to the statutory requirements of
their chosen jurisdiction to maintain the business&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market to Attract&amp;nbsp;Clients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attracting and retaining clients is the lifeblood of any handyman
business. Innovative marketing strategies, from optimizing online
platforms to cultivating community relationships, can significantly
expand a business&amp;#8217;s reach. &lt;a href="https://blog.marketing360.com/local-advertising/handyman-marketing-ideas-tips-and-lead-generation-strategies/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;An effective marketing
approach&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
not only introduces the business to potential clients but also
establishes the brand in the collective consciousness of the&amp;nbsp;community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Leads&amp;nbsp;Effectively&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanding a client base is a dynamic process that requires inventive lead generation techniques. Through methods such as local event sponsorships and strategic online content distribution, handymen can capture the attention of prospective clients. Effective lead generation practices are about &lt;a href="https://contractormarketingnetwork.com/2020/09/19/guide-to-lead-generation-for-handyman/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;positioning the business&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in places where potential clients are most likely to seek handyman&amp;nbsp;services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Launch a User-Friendly&amp;nbsp;Website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the digital age, a user-friendly website serves as a handyman
business&amp;#8217;s virtual storefront. It’s crucial to craft a site that is both
&lt;a href="https://freshysites.com/web-design-development/top-handyman-websites/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;informative and
navigable&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
one that effectively showcases services and simplifies the inquiry and
booking process for potential clients. A well-designed website can be a
deciding factor for clients choosing between competing&amp;nbsp;services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Download Necessary&amp;nbsp;Software&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an age where efficiency equates to success, leveraging technology can
significantly enhance business operations. Handyman businesses can
benefit from a suite of digital tools designed to &lt;a href="https://jungleworks.com/top-10-softwares-for-an-online-handyman-business-in-2023/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;simplify
scheduling, billing, and customer
service&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
thus optimizing time management and productivity. These technological
solutions empower business owners to focus more on service delivery and
less on administrative&amp;nbsp;tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Accounting&amp;nbsp;Help&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficient financial management is a pillar of any thriving business.
Employing accounting software can automate and streamline financial
tasks such as invoicing, payroll, and tax preparations. The right
financial tools not only save time but also &lt;a href="https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/self-employment-taxes/tax-tips-for-handymen-and-odd-jobs/L6Qzg4KPj"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reduce the margin of
error&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
in financial record-keeping, ensuring a clear view of the business&amp;#8217;s
fiscal&amp;nbsp;health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hone Your Communication&amp;nbsp;Skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to communicate effectively with clients is a hallmark of a
thriving handyman business. Honing these skills ensures that customer
expectations are managed, feedback is appropriately acted upon, and a
&lt;a href="https://www.betterup.com/blog/how-to-build-rapport"&gt;&lt;u&gt;strong rapport is
established&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In
the long term, proficient communication fosters client loyalty and
contributes to a sterling reputation within the&amp;nbsp;community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launching a handyman business is a venture ripe with opportunity,
demanding dedication, strategic planning, and a willingness to learn and
adapt. By investing in the right tools, staying legally compliant,
effectively marketing, embracing technology, communicating clearly,
establishing an online presence, managing finances with precision, and
generating leads innovatively, one can build a flourishing enterprise.
Take these insights and transform the vision of a handyman business into
a rewarding&amp;nbsp;reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has never been a bigger disconnect, in my experience, between some of the rosier investment bank views on China and the dim reality on the ground. Perhaps reluctant to back off their calls for a reopening boom this year, sellside economists keep sticking to their forecasts for growth in gross domestic product in 2023, and now expect it to come in well above 5 per cent. That’s even more optimistic than the official target, and wildly out of line with dismal news from Chinese&amp;nbsp;companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopes for a reopening boom were based on the premise that, once released from lockdown, Chinese consumers would go on a spending spree, but company reports show no sign of one. If China’s economy were growing at 5 per cent, then based on historical trends corporate revenues should be growing faster than 8 per cent. Instead, revenues grew at 1.5 per cent in the first&amp;nbsp;quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bisoninterests.substack.com/p/recession-fears-mean-opportunity"&gt;Recession Fears Mean Opportunity in the Oil Market&lt;/a&gt;. Well, up to a&amp;nbsp;point!&lt;/p&gt;

He put his substack behind a paywall a month or two ago, but has now started unlocking the older ones. He is always worth reading, even when he&amp;#8217;s wrong. You will find points of view here which you will never find in the mainstream media. Every post is fuelled by righteous indignation. It&amp;#8217;s energizing just to read&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Does the monarchy&amp;nbsp;matter?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a republican. Anyone can see that simply getting rid of a king is hardly the secret of a successful political order in a country. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; royal family may have cultural influence, a lot of money, and the direct access to heads of government that is denied to the 99.99%. But cutting off their heads would not turn us into France, which anyway is not such a&amp;nbsp;paradise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am uncomfortable about suggestions that the royal family does in fact influence laws in a way that favours it. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jul/28/queen-secretly-lobbied-scottish-ministers-climate-law-exemption" title="Exemption from obligation to facilitate the construction of pipelines for renewable heating."&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is just one example, but I have seen suggestions that there are many. But even this is not the issue I am most concerned about. My concern is that the mere contact between royals an ministers acts to affect what legislation is passed. Mikhail Khodorkovsky was jailed by Putin, and had a lot of his (admittedly enormous) wealth taken away, but he was never the target of an assassination. When asked why this was, he said that it was because he and Putin knew each other personally. I think that when the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt; meets the monarch, on a weekly (?) basis, it&amp;#8217;s hard for him to actively promote any policies which would have an adverse effect on him and his family. This ends up with a bias towards enacting policy that increases inequality. Politicians all talk about boosting productivity, but they know in their hearts that it&amp;#8217;s a lot easier to transfer existing resources than to accelerate the production of new&amp;nbsp;ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone said to me the other week that his strategy for advancing his career was to identify influential people, and make himself as useful to them as he possibly could be. Although I&amp;#8217;d like to imagine that in the real world merit would be its own reward, this idea doesn&amp;#8217;t long survive any contact with reality. At least in a job with clear metrics, such as professional sport, sucking up to the boss is not the secret of success. I always wonder whether the transparency of professional sport results in international competition being dominated by vaguely democratic countries (other than in the rather odd collection of fringe sports that characterise the&amp;nbsp;Olympics).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monarchy, especially the late queen, was viewed very favourably by most of her subjects.
She seemed to be hard working &amp;#8212; at least she turned up to the opening of an awful lot of dull buildings &amp;#8212;
but she hardly had the inclination, or energy, to keep in personal touch with every one of us. She did the next best thing, however, which was to maintain an extensive press office, and feed the media with endless stories and pictures of the royal family, especially the more photogenic and scandal-free ones, such as the Duchess of Cambridge. It&amp;#8217;s a well-worn trope that the Royal Family is a long-running soap opera, but everyone loves the stars of such shows, even if they are pantomime villains.
I guess we&amp;#8217;d have to make an exception for Prince&amp;nbsp;Andrew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I almost persuaded myself to become a republican, but I think I can just about remain a monarchy-agnostic. It&amp;#8217;s much easier to destroy an institution than to come up with a convincingly superior alternative.
The monarchy has adapted itself to coexist with its host, like all successful parasites. If it tries to extract too many goodies, eventually the host will react and its immune system will rid itself of the monarchy.
It may even be that the monarch is like a mitochondrion: something that started as a foreign body, a pathogen, but which has now taken on some role without which the host would die.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, I&amp;#8217;m not too concerned that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; would waste away without the royals, but it would be a different place, and possibly a worse&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Judiciary and How Anti-Monopoly Cases are&amp;nbsp;Decided&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States has a big problem: its politics are dominated by corporate interests, and so too is its law. This is evident in the way that anti-monopoly cases are&amp;nbsp;decided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Judiciary and How Anti-Monopoly Cases are&amp;nbsp;Decided&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States has a big problem: its politics are dominated by corporate interests, and so too is its law. This is evident in the way that anti-monopoly cases are&amp;nbsp;decided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a major corporation is accused of anti-competitive behaviour, the mainstream media will often cover the story. But when the case is about something as mundane as &amp;#8220;door hardware,&amp;#8221; no one cares. This is because the vast majority of people are unaware of the importance of antitrust law, and they don&amp;#8217;t understand how it affects their&amp;nbsp;lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is one person who does understand the importance of antitrust law: Matt Stoller. Stoller is a writer and researcher who has been writing about antitrust for years. In his latest article, Stoller argues that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; judiciary is failing to protect consumers from corporate consolidation. He has written about the Assa Abloy case&amp;nbsp;[here][1].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stoller points to the case of Assa Abloy, a Swedish company that is the world&amp;#8217;s largest producer of door hardware. Assa Abloy has been on a buying spree in recent years, acquiring dozens of smaller companies. In 2021, Assa Abloy announced that it was planning to acquire Spectrum Brands, a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; company that is one of Assa Abloy&amp;#8217;s biggest&amp;nbsp;rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Department of Justice (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOJ&lt;/span&gt;) sued to block the merger, arguing that it would create a monopoly in the door hardware market. But the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOJ&lt;/span&gt; lost its case in court. The judge ruled that the merger would not harm consumers, because Assa Abloy and Spectrum Brands were already competing with each&amp;nbsp;other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stoller argues that the judge&amp;#8217;s decision was wrong. He points out that Assa Abloy and Spectrum Brands are not direct competitors, because they sell their products to different customers. Assa Abloy sells its products to businesses, while Spectrum Brands sells its products to consumers. The point is that businesses end up selling to consumers. That is their &lt;em&gt;raison d&amp;#8217;être&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The merger of Assa Abloy and Spectrum Brands will create a near monopoly in the business-to-business market for door hardware, the dullest of dull categories, but what is life if not an accumulation of dull categories? More seriously,
as production of more and more dull stuff becomes increasingly concentrated, the increased productivity that comes from the need to compete by innovation evaporates. Ultimately, this is visible in poor productivity growth, which is found in almost all developed markets over the last couple of decades. Correlation is not causation, but it is highly&amp;nbsp;suggestive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we genuinely incentivise elected officials and regulators to act in the interests of consumers, and against the interests of corporate power? It genuinely is more difficult than it seems. Winning elections needs money, and money comes from producers and not consumers. All parties are descending into a single party of producer interest, pretending to represent real ideological differences. Somehow, previous generations passed laws that promoted genuine competition. Let&amp;#8217;s hope we can do it&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;

The reality is that the 10Y &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; yield went down 14bp: hardly falling off a cliff!
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; went down 21bp. 
So far, the world has taken this latest bank failure at face value.
There was some evidence that the job market is weakening: quits were down, but still high by historical standards.
The fact is that nobody knows anything, and we are all&amp;nbsp;waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond prices are manipulated, so it&amp;#8217;s always worth looking at equities and commodities too.
Equities were off by around 1%, crude by &amp;gt;5% (although after a recent strong&amp;nbsp;run).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Exorbitant privilege and all&amp;nbsp;that&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed has created a lot of money.
Of course, a lot of it has not translated into private sector spending, and so the impact on inflation
has not been huge, but private sector lending has taken off again since the pandemic and has only started 
levelled off in the last year or&amp;nbsp;so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the world does not want to be tied to the dollar for pricing its exports (and imports).
China is the obvious case, but Russia would much prefer that oil were not priced in dollars.
The global south is increasingly looking to hedge its bets, and borrow from Japan and China, rather than 
western lenders, and in yuan rather than dollars. 
I am not sure it&amp;#8217;s about not liking the dollar, it&amp;#8217;s more about not wishing to be tied into a money transfer system that depends on the goodwill and supervision of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; authorities.
I keep my money in several banks, not because I have a problem with any of them &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt; but because I know that for accidental and possibly intentional reasons sometimes I will find that I cannot make payments from one of them. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, the Eurodollar system is largely offshore,
but every so often a transfer between parties which will have to go through a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; correspondent bank needs to be&amp;nbsp;made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point, surely, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; is going to be hit.
Of course, all other currencies have problems, and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; has the great advantage of having an army which is currently by far the biggest in the&amp;nbsp;world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many commentators are convinced that de-dollarization is coming, but I am not one of them.
I think that world trade will continue to be conducted in dollars. 
However, I do not think this requires the dollar to remain strong forever.
In many ways, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; voter would be a lot better off with a weak dollar,
not least in that the factory jobs that have be exported to China might start to trickle&amp;nbsp;back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent Johnson&amp;#8217;s Milkshake Theory has had a good run, but as the Fed gets ready to reduce rates, it&amp;#8217;s days
must be&amp;nbsp;numbered!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started thinking about de-dollarization when I read [this article][1] from &amp;#8216;The Cradle&amp;#8217; &amp;#8212; a publication focusing on &amp;#8216;West Asia&amp;#8217; (or what I think of as &amp;#8216;The Middle East&amp;#8217;). 
There has been a recent resurgence of Google searches for &amp;#8216;dedollarization&amp;#8217;, but it has never been exactly popular.
Of course, I guess the people who are really interested are based in Russia, Iran, North Korea and China, so wouldn&amp;#8217;t be searching in English, nor using Google, so maybe this does not signify&amp;nbsp;anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know about availability bias, confirmation bias, and probably several more systematic ways in which our intuition leads us astray in assessing the state of the world. There really are an almost uncountable number of cognitive biases, as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases"&gt;this Wikipedia Article&lt;/a&gt; reveals.
This is an article about how people generally underestimate how much better off they are, really, than they&amp;nbsp;were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, as we age, we have less to look forward to, and more cause for regret. 
But, actually, things generally do get better, and especially real assets generally increase in value, if only because our unit of measurement is constantly&amp;nbsp;shrinking. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Energy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am chronically bullish on energy.&lt;br&gt;
Oil used to be boring. 
Right through to the end of the 90&amp;#8217;s, the price of a barrel oscillated around $20.
There was a massive spike before the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GFC&lt;/span&gt;, a crash after it (but only down to $40), 
but since then it has been extremely volatile, but generally making higher highs, 
reaching $110 in the aftermath of the early part of the lockdown, and finally dropping very rapidly
over the first quarter of this&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="a long history of oil prices" src="https://www.stevehemingway.com/cl1_com.svg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most commentators I follow are fairly bullish on oil. 
The thesis is that the pivot to net zero will take longer than expected, 
and that we&amp;#8217;ll need to burn through a lot of conventional energy to
get there.
(Well, and the transition will be inflationary, but that&amp;#8217;s another way of saying
the same&amp;nbsp;thing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the commentators is Josh Young of Bison Interests. His fund, comprising equities issued by small-cap
energy companies, has done very well.
In his latest newsletter (unlinkable, but you can get for free by signing up via &lt;a href="https://bisoninterests.com/mailing-list"&gt;https://bisoninterests.com/mailing-list&lt;/a&gt;),
he argues that it&amp;#8217;s not correct to compare his fund against mega ETFs like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XLE&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XOP&lt;/span&gt;, but that a more specific small cap energy index
is relevant.
Well, you can&amp;#8217;t invest in an index, but you can invest in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSCE&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;a href="https://etfdb.com/etf/PSCE/#etf-ticker-valuation-dividend"&gt;https://etfdb.com/etf/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PSCE&lt;/span&gt;/#etf-ticker-valuation-dividend&lt;/a&gt;).
If you fancy a bet on small cap energy (and Bison Interests suggests that you should), you can invest in an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt;, as well as the
individual stocks mentioned by Josh Young. As is obvious from the chart, the volatility of this sector is likely to be horrendous, 
so avoid anything highly geared, otherwise it&amp;#8217;ll be wiped out in the coming (possible) recession.
An &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; should mitigate the vol. slightly, but if we do get the recession that Jeff Snider has been predicting for a couple of years
(and the collapse of First Republic Bank makes it more likely), the stock correlation will jump to one and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt; won&amp;#8217;t save&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing here is investment advice, but going long anything at the moment seems rash, so maybe the thing is just to monitor the&amp;nbsp;shareprice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Druckenmiller&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stumbled across &lt;a href="https://tidalwave.substack.com/p/transcript-druckenmiller-april-2023"&gt;this transcript&lt;/a&gt; of an interview with Stanley Druckenmiller.
What I love about Stan is that although he is one of the most successful investors of all time, 
he is always quick to admit that he doesn&amp;#8217;t really have a clue about what to invest in.
Well, he has a bit of a clue, and shares some of his ideas with us, but he is quick to say that he might be wrong,
and might change his mind at any moment. He says that he&amp;#8217;s short the dollar, but that we shouldn&amp;#8217;t emulate him, 
because he might be long tomorrow. The nice thing about macro investors is that you know they&amp;#8217;re not talking their book
(or the opposite of his book because they want to close a position that they want to liquidate, which seems to be the norm
when single stocks are&amp;nbsp;involved).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stan thinks we&amp;#8217;re going to have a recession, but he doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to know how to take advantage of that. 
As he says, bonds are already very expensive, so buying them might not work out. 
Although shorting equities would seem logical, some sectors might just keep going up.
As he says, the big problem is knowing what the Fed will do in response to signs that we are going into a recession.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVB&lt;/span&gt; reversed all of the recent &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QT&lt;/span&gt;, and a recession would, almost certainly, see the Fed balance sheet balloon even further.
A few years ago, a Fed balance sheet of around 50% of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; would seem inconceivable, but there is no technical reason why it 
could not go to 100% (as part of some set of &amp;#8216;emergency&amp;#8217; measures). The government, and big business, and individual politicians, 
and (probably) owner occupiers would all desperately want the Fed to act when recession hits. The fact that Rudy Havenstein and 
Peter Schiff would be utterly appalled would hardly count for&amp;nbsp;much!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also talks about how the market has fewer of the systematic price behaviours that he used to be able to exploit in the past,
because humans (or computers) have made markets more efficient. 
He makes a similar point about price reaction to news, which is less predictable today than it was, something
he attributes to hedge funds/algos, rather than passive&amp;nbsp;investing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, Druck is short on actionable ideas, but is fascinating to read.
One odd thing (to me) that he states is that he often invests first, and does his analysis afterwards, 
because &amp;#8212; even with his resources &amp;#8212; if he waits for the analysis to be complete before taking advantage,
the stock will have already moved too far against&amp;nbsp;him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To someone like me, Druck is the counter-example that disproves a theory.
Well, it&amp;#8217;s a hypothesis, the Efficient Market Hypothesis, but a hypothesis so solidly embedded in modern financial theory
that it&amp;#8217;s hard to think of a single example of a theory that is more solidly established.
Of course, it could just be luck, but as Warren Buffett (another &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMH&lt;/span&gt; outlier) has commented, 
statistically, it&amp;#8217;s hard to argue that&amp;nbsp;case.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Regulatory Arbitrage</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/regulatory-arbitrage.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-04-27T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-05-01T10:34:24+01:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2023-04-27:/regulatory-arbitrage.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Thursday 27, April&amp;nbsp;2023&lt;/h1&gt;

insightful articles ever day of the year&amp;nbsp;(nearly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, &amp;#8216;he&amp;#8217; wrote the&amp;nbsp;following: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to be a corporate equity derivatives investment banker, which means that I’d go to companies and try to convince them to buy or sell options on their own stock. If you read a finance textbook, you will get the impression that derivatives are mostly about risk management, about hedging and speculation: People who own stock buy put options to protect themselves agains price declines, or sell call options to transform some of their potential upside into cash now; people who don’t own stock buy calls to take some cheap stock-price risk,&amp;nbsp;etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This describes almost none of what I was selling to these companies. What I was selling, much of the time, was tax deductions: We could build you a derivative that, sure, had the economic properties of some call options, but that took advantage of technical tax rules to get you extra deductions.[2]  Other times I was selling accounting treatment: We could do a thing that had the economic properties of buying back stock, but that took advantage of technical accounting rules to juice your earnings per share a bit more.[3]  Or I might be selling something like securities-law compliance: If you had some legal restriction on your ability to buy or sell stock, you could buy a derivative from us that was economically like buying or selling stock, but that avoided those&amp;nbsp;restrictions.[4]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my line of work, derivatives were essentially about regulatory arbitrage: There were some complicated rules, created by legislators or regulators or accounting standards-setters, and those rules had the effect of rewarding some things and penalizing other things. And our job was to find a way to take something that the rules penalized and turn it into something that the rules rewarded, without changing its economic substance too&amp;nbsp;much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A famous example. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; tax code discourages short-term trading and encourages long-term investing. If you borrow a lot of money to rapidly trade stocks, you will be penalized, paying short-term capital gains rates. If you buy a long-term call option on a variable basket of stocks that you have management rights over, you will be rewarded, paying long-term capital gains rates. If you notice that those two things are the same, you can have a lucrative career as a derivatives structurer. (And get in trouble: This is the Renaissance Technologies tax trade, and it ended up not&amp;nbsp;working.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lesson that I learned from my career as a derivatives structurer is that much of finance is about this sort of regulatory arbitrage. Economic life is socially constructed, society has rules, and you can make use of the rules to make&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the rules change and particular businesses get harder. But there is a sort of conservation law at work; the rules for complex systems have to be somewhat complex, and if you have mastered the current complexities you can probably figure out how to make money off new and different complexities. Tax trades sometimes get shut down by new tax rules, but that doesn’t put tax structurers out of work; they’re the ones who are best positioned to figure out the new tax trades enabled by the new&amp;nbsp;rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes some whole new area of economic life gets brought into the domain of rules, and a new industry springs up to game it. In my lifetime, environmental, social and governance investing went from an academic idea to a huge business with all sorts of competing and economically important regulatory and accounting regimes, and so there are lots of people in the financial industry working on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESG&lt;/span&gt; arbitrage.[5]  “&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESG&lt;/span&gt; Consultant But Evil,” I sometimes call this job, and we talked last week about how companies whose business is cutting down trees can get environmental credit for the trees they don’t cut down. That is the purest form of financial engineering: Some accounting regime exists that rewards you for not cutting down trees, you are in the business of cutting down trees, and you find a way to make cutting down trees look, for the relevant accounting purposes, like not cutting down&amp;nbsp;trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More rarely, some set of rules will go away or be simplified in a way that really does demolish someone’s business niche. For instance, there is, in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, a rule saying that bank accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. up to $250,000. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FDIC&lt;/span&gt; insurance is valuable, but you cannot pay the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FDIC&lt;/span&gt; directly for the amount of insurance that you want: If you have $250,000 in your bank account, it is all insured without you doing anything; if you have $2,500,000, it mostly isn’t, and that’s just that. But of course you can open 10 accounts at 10 banks and put $250,000 in each of them; then they will all be insured. If you have $25,000,000, you can open 100 accounts at 100 banks, but that is pretty annoying. But someone else can open 100 accounts for you at 100 banks, and put $250,000 in each of them, and charge you a fee. That intermediary is selling you &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FDIC&lt;/span&gt; insurance, and charging you a fee for it, because it has found a (fairly straightforward) way to structure around this one &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FDIC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that really exists and is a business (“brokered deposits”). And if the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FDIC&lt;/span&gt; tinkered with its rules in some way — if it changed the rules so that all of a household’s bank accounts at one bank counted together toward the limit, or so that checking and savings accounts at the same bank counted separately, or whatever — then probably the intermediaries who currently sell this product would be best positioned to sell a revised product to comply with the new rules; they are the experts at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FDIC&lt;/span&gt; insurance cap&amp;nbsp;structuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FDIC&lt;/span&gt; did away with the limit entirely they’d be out of business. David Dayen&amp;nbsp;reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legislation has been proposed to uncap deposit insurance. And that has prompted the private equity–owned company that is one of the main beneficiaries of the cap to spring into&amp;nbsp;action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A company called IntraFi offers two products that allow large depositors to spread their money among a network of hundreds of banks, each with accounts that don’t exceed the cap and are therefore effectively covered in full by deposit insurance. The company takes a fee for facilitating these “brokered deposits.” If deposit insurance were uncapped, their business model would be&amp;nbsp;worthless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prospect of uncapping has the extremely well-connected officials at IntraFi scrambling. In the first quarter of 2023, when Silicon Valley Bank was shuttered, IntraFi tripled its lobbying expenses and hired a firm known for its access to senior congressional leadership. The new lobbyists who registered to work for IntraFi have experience with senior members of Congress, as well as the Trump and Obama White Houses. It’s a full-court press to maintain a lucrative status quo.&amp;nbsp;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brokered deposits have been heavily criticized by former &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FDIC&lt;/span&gt; chair Sheila Bair, who described them as “just gaming the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FDIC&lt;/span&gt; rules. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FDIC&lt;/span&gt; takes all the credit risk, and Promontory [IntraFi’s predecessor] gets the&amp;nbsp;profit.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, yes, I don’t disagree, I’d just point out that “[product] is just gaming the [government agency] rules; the government takes all the credit risk and [company] gets the profit” describes a surprisingly large portion of&amp;nbsp;finance!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a wonderful read, but the basic point is that there is a sort of arms race in which one set of smart people create rules to prevent things happening, 
and another set of smart people craft clever (but possibly complicated) ways of doing something which is economically equivalent anyway.
It just seems to me that if enough of this sort of thing is going on, no wonder our productivity growth is so weak.
Finance is a big part of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; economy (according to &lt;a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn06193/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, about 8.3% of the economy, 
and surely responsible for employing more than that proportion of the best brains in the country). 
Given that &amp;#8216;finance&amp;#8217; is just about routing savings (income which is not consumed) into investment (physical or intellectual capital), this is a lot of friction. I suppose that those who argue that finance is doing &amp;#8220;God&amp;#8217;s work&amp;#8221; would say that bankers ensure that savings are put to their best use.
Well, I leave you to decided on&amp;nbsp;that!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Winners and losers and the political economy of inflation</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/winners-and-losers-and-the-political-economy-of-inflation.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-04-25T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-04-25T20:33:12+01:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2023-04-25:/winners-and-losers-and-the-political-economy-of-inflation.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Tuesday 25, April&amp;nbsp;2023&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Who are the winners and losers of&amp;nbsp;inflation?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When inflation spikes, the losers are those who are long bonds. This is because the value of bonds falls when inflation rises. The reason for this is that bonds are essentially loans, and the value of a loan is determined by the interest rate. When inflation rises, the real interest rate (the interest rate minus inflation) falls. This makes bonds less attractive to investors, and the value of bonds&amp;nbsp;falls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winners of inflation are those who have assets that rise in value with inflation. This includes assets such as real estate, commodities, and stocks. The reason for this is that the prices of these assets tend to rise with inflation. This is because they are not directly linked to the value of money, and their prices are determined by supply and&amp;nbsp;demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The bond market is a shadow of its former&amp;nbsp;self&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bond market is a market where bonds are bought and sold. In the past, the bond market was a powerful force that could influence monetary policy. This is because the bond market is a large market, and it is a market where many different types of investors participate. If the bond market is worried about inflation, it can sell bonds, which drives up interest rates. This can force the central bank to raise interest rates, which can help to cool&amp;nbsp;inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the bond market is not as powerful as it used to be. This is because the bond market is now dominated by a few large players, such as central banks and insurance companies. These players are not as sensitive to inflation as they used to be, and they are not as likely to sell bonds when inflation rises. This means that the bond market is less likely to influence monetary policy, and it is less likely to help to cool&amp;nbsp;inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why inflation will be a hard dragon to&amp;nbsp;slay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of reasons why inflation will be a hard dragon to slay. First, the bond market is not as powerful as it used to be. This means that the central bank will have less help from the bond market in fighting inflation. Second, the economy is more globalized than it used to be. This means that inflation can spread more easily from one country to another. Third, the cost of living is rising in many countries. This means that people are more likely to accept higher prices, which can make it more difficult to bring inflation under&amp;nbsp;control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, there are a number of reasons why inflation will be a hard dragon to slay. The bond market is not as powerful as it used to be, the economy is more globalized, and the cost of living is rising. This means that the central bank will have a more difficult time fighting&amp;nbsp;inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A meta analysis of the likelihood of future&amp;nbsp;inflation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the topic of inflation, I always think that in the prediction game it&amp;#8217;s always good to think about who will be the winners and who will be the losers. When inflation spikes, the losers are those who are long bonds.
But bonds are largely held by foreigners, the central bank, insurance companies and pension funds and commercial banks.
Nobody really wants to hold bonds, but thanks to peculiar incentives to hold bonds (e.g. zero risk weighting on banks&amp;#8217; balance sheets), they do &lt;em&gt;faut de mieux&lt;/em&gt;.  So, the mighty bond market that stiffened Carter&amp;#8217;s and then Reagan&amp;#8217;s spines to kill the economy to staunch the bleeding of bondholders are a shadow of their former selves. This applies particularly to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;, but it applies fairly well to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; and&amp;nbsp;Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for both these reasons, I think inflation will prove a harder dragon to slay than central banks&amp;nbsp;believe.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoy Bethany McLean and Luigi Zingales&amp;#8217; podcast, Capitalisn&amp;#8217;t. I&amp;#8217;ve listened to a few episodes and I find them to be very informative and thought-provoking. One I listened to recently was &lt;a href="https://www.capitalisnt.com/episodes/has-thinking-like-an-economist-distorted-our-politics"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; with  Elizabeth Popp Berman, who argues that that measuring every political outcome in monetary units is a bad idea. She would argue that there are many benefits to society that cannot be easily measured in money, such as a clean environment, a strong social safety net, and a sense of&amp;nbsp;community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also agree with Luigi Zingales that the Left has moved away from class-based politics in recent years. This is partly due to the fact that the economy has become more globalized, making it more difficult to identify a clear &amp;#8220;enemy&amp;#8221; for the Left to rally against. Additionally, the Left has been more successful in recent years in winning over voters on issues such as social justice and environmental protection, which are not as closely tied to&amp;nbsp;class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#8217;s important for the Left to find a way to balance its focus on class-based issues with its focus on other issues that are important to voters. If the Left can do this, it will be in a stronger position to win elections and enact positive&amp;nbsp;change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increasing use of economic thinking to frame political questions has resulted in the Left accepting that  a focus on efficiency and productivity will inevitably lead to a loss of other values, such as equity and fairness. The problem is that this move has led to an ever increasing difficulty in mobilizing grass-roots support, which leads to a greater dependence of funding from big business to keep Left parties&amp;nbsp;viable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine  a factory that dyes wool.
The waste chemicals just get discharged into the river that runs by the factory.
Fish get killed, but the factories costs are minimized and consumers benefit from cheaper coloured clothes.
It&amp;#8217;s hard to quantify, but clearly the benefit of those  clothes being available for less is offset to a degree by the harm to the environment. This harm is an &lt;em&gt;externality&lt;/em&gt;, a cost imposed on a party that&amp;#8217;s external to the contracting parties (the factory and the consumer, presumably intermediated through some garment&amp;nbsp;producers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the government decides that this sort of thing is intolerable and imposes an obligation on the factory to clean up its act and dispose of the harmful effluent safely. It does so, but this costs money, which ends up being paid by those who ultimately consume the product. The world is (probably) no worse off, &lt;em&gt;but measured inflation has gone up&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net Zero will work like this. If we all live in passivehausen, and drive around in Teslas using electricity from wind turbines &lt;em&gt;there will be a cost&lt;/em&gt; (and probably a big one). This cost will show up in inflation measures.
We may have saved the planet, but it won&amp;#8217;t be free. It won&amp;#8217;t even be cheap. So, I think we have several decades of elevated inflation to look forward&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After we&amp;#8217;ve transitioned, maybe inflation will crater, but this won&amp;#8217;t be quick and it will push up yields.
Now, the current inflation induced by the pandemic/Ukraine/re-shoring may drop and we normalize, but the Inflation Reduction Act in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, and counter-measures in Europe (and Japan?) will push up prices of consumable like energy, and when energy gets expensive, everything&amp;nbsp;does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adam Smith divided value into wages, profits and &lt;em&gt;rent&lt;/em&gt;.
Rent was the income derived from that factor of production whose supply was
perfectly inelastic, the return to the &lt;em&gt;rentier&lt;/em&gt;, which comprises 
an income derived from the scarcity of land, of which there is a fixed
amount in the&amp;nbsp;world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profits are the income which derives from the use of capital, such as a ship
or a factory. Capital can be produced, but at the cost of (current) consumption.
So, profits are the reward for deferred&amp;nbsp;consumption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wages are the return to labour. 
In some sense, labour is like capital: people even speak of &amp;#8216;human capital&amp;#8217;, but
the supply of it does not respond to the price in the same way that physical capital&amp;nbsp;does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economics is a complex subject, and I am not an economist, but I wanted to state a 
few definitions, rather than just dive in and use jargon words which have meanings
which are different to those used in ordinary&amp;nbsp;English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keynes tended to write about labour as a homogenous resource. He did make some acknowledgement
of some workers being able to command a higher wage than others, but he implicitly (maybe explicitly:
it&amp;#8217;s a long time since I read &amp;#8216;The General Theory&amp;#8217;) hand-waved that away, saying that
as long as the relative wages, and the relative proportions of workers with the various skills, 
remained constant, this did not invalidate his&amp;nbsp;theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that variations in individual wages are just a reflection of the variations in 
individual productivity seems utterly at odds with what I have observed in my working life, 
and with what I see in the world around me. For it to be true, it would need a perfect market 
in which the value of an individual to his employer would be instantly measurable.
In the real world, employees become valuable only after a considerable time with their employers.
There is a lot of job-specific knowledge to absorb.
Job switching has a large cost for employee and employer, something that is (partially) reflected
in the many laws which treat a contract of employment very differently to a contract for the supply 
of&amp;nbsp;potatoes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#8217;s clear that a high cognitive ability is a requirement to do quite a few jobs.
Top lawyers are, I am sure, very smart. 
But surely, their remuneration is more a function of their scarcity value than of some intrinsic 
productivity. 
This all meshes with the signalling value of education. 
The salary boost of having gone to Harvard Law School is surely not a function of 
the actual knowledge obtained there, but of the credential of having been admitted to&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem is how to demonstrate this as the explanation, as opposed to the idea that
the reason investment bankers are paid so much is that there is such a high demand for them, relative to supply.
This seems really very unlikely, but might be true. Some observers have pointed out that the demand for lawyers
is largely a function of how many lawyers are already&amp;nbsp;practicising.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Bandwagons, bubbles and Ponzi schemes</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/bandwagons-bubbles-and-ponzi-schemes.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-04-15T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-04-25T20:29:07+01:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2023-04-15:/bandwagons-bubbles-and-ponzi-schemes.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Saturday 15, April&amp;nbsp;2023&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the post makes clear, it&amp;#8217;s damn tough, because a bubble can keep inflating  long after your shorts have driven you to bankruptcy.  Bubbles eventually pop, but while other markets remain calm they tend to just keep going up, becoming more overvalued, but generating more &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOMO&lt;/span&gt; all the&amp;nbsp;while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post gives an account of how Druckenmiller tried to short the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASDAQ&lt;/span&gt; just before the Dot Com crash, but pivoted at the last minute to make a lot of money, before eventually losing quite a bit of it when he overstayed his&amp;nbsp;welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As bubbles get more extreme, the market depth presumably gets shallower and shallower.
Nobody is selling, because the shorts have long gone and the longs have become convinced that their stocks never go down in value.  That is, until everyone is selling, and nobody is&amp;nbsp;buying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We seem to have been in this state since March 2020. There has been some equity market weakness, but we haven&amp;#8217;t had what might be called a proper crash. By the time we get it, I may be dead, but I&amp;#8217;ll almost certainly have no capital to take advantage of&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t find the exact quote, but Kuppy (@hkuppy on Twitter) used to argue that you should jump on a bubble (or Ponzi scheme etc.) as soon as you spot it. Of course, we all think we can get out in time, but buying some out of the money puts helps one sleep at&amp;nbsp;night.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Old Friends and autoimmune diseases</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/old-friends-and-autoimmune-diseases.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-04-09T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-04-09T17:12:14+01:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2023-04-09:/old-friends-and-autoimmune-diseases.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Sunday  9, April&amp;nbsp;2023&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Old&amp;nbsp;Friends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had a number of close friends and relations suffer from Crohn&amp;#8217;s Disease and similar
autoimmune conditions (including the most common of all, coeliac disease).
My best friend from school had Crohn&amp;#8217;s, as did his brother.
It&amp;#8217;s a pretty terrible thing, and used to be treated by repeatedly removing sections of gut.
Another friend, who I met later, had the disease, and had so much gut removed that he had to be fed&amp;nbsp;intravenously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; has an epidemic of autoimmune diseases. Diabetes Mellitus, 
of which there is an epidemic in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; is one, as is rheumatoid arthritis, virtiligo,
multiple sclerosis, and Hashimoto&amp;#8217;s disease. 
There are many, many others. There are suggestions that depression and some types 
of heart diseases are autoimmune in&amp;nbsp;origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general public is aware that they are common, especially diabetes, and know that there
is an environmental link, although probably some sort of genetic link too. 
My friend with Crohn&amp;#8217;s had a sister with rheumatoid&amp;nbsp;arthritis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to have more medical friends, but I have never heard any of them discussing 
the problem in general terms (rather than discussing the individual diseases in&amp;nbsp;isolation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A popular theory is that our immune systems develop without exposure to a range of microorganisms and parasites (such as helminthic worms) that have co-existed with us
since the dawn of time. 
This is a variation on the &amp;#8216;hygiene hypothesis&amp;#8217; that simply says that we need exposure to more dirt (microbes in general). Of course, it&amp;#8217;s hard to be selective about friends of this sort, so the practical implications are&amp;nbsp;few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug companies are well aware of the importance of this class of disease. Humira (adalimumab) is the world&amp;#8217;s most profitable drug. It works by blocking a protein (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TNF&lt;/span&gt;-alpha) found in the body&amp;#8217;s immune system that causes joint swelling and inflammation. 
But, as is so often the case, it&amp;#8217;s a drug that is a treatment, but not a&amp;nbsp;cure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not have the background to decide on how important these theories are.
I know that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; website, and websites dedicated to these diseases &lt;em&gt;never mention early years conditioning of the immune system as a causative factor&lt;/em&gt;. 
Actually, I don&amp;#8217;t know if this is never mentioned, but it is completely absent from &lt;a href="https://nras.org.uk/resource/possible-causes-and-risk-factors/"&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt;, which is devoted to explaining the causes and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
I don&amp;#8217;t want to speculate on the reasons for this possible omission, but I am sure that readers can think of some conflicts of interest that could be at&amp;nbsp;play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Blair&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;legacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tony Blair has been in the news again.
It&amp;#8217;s the 20th anniversary of the Second Gulf War.
There are numbers of reports of Keir Starmer soliciting advice from Tony Blair (e.g. &lt;a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/keir-starmer-taking-advice-blair-28532880"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).
The shadow cabinet have been working hard to raise their media profiles.
I listened to &lt;a href="https://www.politico.eu/podcast/meet-rachel-reeves-britains-next-chancellor/"&gt;this podcast&lt;/a&gt;, a very favourable
profile of Rachel Reeves, who shows the same sort of on-message discipline that I can just remember from Tony Blair&amp;#8217;s heyday.
The same goes for Wes Streeting, who is, from what I can tell, constantly &amp;#8216;on-message&amp;#8217;, and therefore a huge contrast
to the more relaxed time when Jeremy Corbyn was in charge. 
I am sure that Tony would have loved to expel Corbyn from the party. It looks like he finally got his way via a&amp;nbsp;proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, for what it&amp;#8217;s worth, Tony Blair is the reason that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; electorate have voted Conservatives.
It is not the genius of  David Cameron or Theresa May or Boris Johnson that won elections. It&amp;#8217;s the fact that
the divisions that were sowed by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TB&lt;/span&gt; left the Labour Party incapable of forming an effective election-fighting force.
Voters who are naturally on the right think they might as well vote for the real thing, rather than an ersatz version.
Voters who would &amp;#8216;normally&amp;#8217; vote Labour don&amp;#8217;t want to vote for a party that has been in the middle of a civil war ever since they last left office.
They either want Corbyn but are afraid that there will be an internal coup and they&amp;#8217;ll be left with a &amp;#8216;Red Tory&amp;#8217; party, or 
they actually want someone like Tony Blair but are afraid that if they vote Labour they&amp;#8217;ll end up with&amp;nbsp;Momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some sympathy for Blair. In spite of his massive wealth and popularity amongst the Davos set, 
he seems to be reviled by Left and Right alike.  The Daily Mail and similar rags 
have portrayed Blair as 
some sort of ghoul, circling the globe in his private jet,
landing only to collect bags of tax-free lucre from despots and rent-seeking corporates and financiers.
For me, Blair is more of a symptom than a cause. 
It&amp;#8217;s the fact that we live in a system in which politicians can have this kind of afterlife, 
funded out of the monopoly profits that were created by earlier &amp;#8216;business friendly&amp;#8217; legislation,
and paid to send the strongest possible signal to the new incumbents that is the issue,
not the individual&amp;nbsp;recipients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what has led us into a system where politicians are lead into such temptation?
One problem seems to be a &amp;#8216;first past the post&amp;#8217; system, which leads to two dominant,
permanent parties. An other seems to be a press which is aligned with big business 
(hardly an uncommon thing). 
Maybe there are others. A lack of dislocation, such as that produced by war, or revolution,
or runaway inflation, may cause institutions to fossilize into a coalition to defend 
the status quo, although if that is the case the cure may be worse than the&amp;nbsp;disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although &amp;#8216;First Past the Post&amp;#8217; has failed to produce large majorities consistently, and has given disproportionate power to fringe parties, 
such as the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DUP&lt;/span&gt; under Theresa May, it has ensured the dominance of a two-party system. This suits both Labour and the Conservatives, 
but does not lead to good policy decisions, and leaves voters increasingly disillusioned and&amp;nbsp;disaffected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tony Blair has even been accused of being responsible for the rise of the Scottish Nationalist Party and the concomitant fall of Labour in Scotland, which is in some narrow sense is true, as Blair introduced the devolution that brought the Scottish Parliament into existence. 
Certainly, the loss of Scotland has critically injured&amp;nbsp;Labour. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Inflation.

&lt;h2&gt;Same observations, different&amp;nbsp;conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflation is an obsession with most economists, which is weird, because most of economics
deliberately tries to ignore it and focus on real variables. 
For most ordinary mortals, money is what they spend their valuable time trying to earn.
For economists, money is simply a means to an end, a measure of the ability to consume, 
which is, after all, &amp;#8216;the sole purpose of economic activity&amp;#8217; as Keynes&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; is carefully measured in real terms. Economists are concerned about real production (steel girders) and real consumption (hamburgers), and want to eliminate the effect of a rather unstable unit of account. The problem is that inflation &lt;em&gt;redistributes real resources&lt;/em&gt;.
When a worker saves money all his working life, he wants to consume an amount of future
production which is equivalent to the real resources he has forgone consuming during the 
time he was more productive. Any phenomenon that redistributes wealth (the ability to consume in the future) is fair game for politicians to argue&amp;nbsp;over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rudy&amp;nbsp;Havenstein&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real Rudy H (aka Rudolf &lt;span class="caps"&gt;E. A.&lt;/span&gt; Havenstein) was the president of the Reichsbank during the hyperinflationary period between 1920 and 1923. But his re-incarnation as a substack pundit (&lt;a href="https://substack.com/profile/22041356-rudy-havenstein"&gt;https://substack.com/profile/22041356-rudy-havenstein&lt;/a&gt;) is who I am really thinking about.
He is incandescent that the Fed has generated a vast pool of money (reserves at the Fed, amounting to around $9T, or getting on for half of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;) which has created inflation which has impoverished ordinary workers in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; and which, in terms of the basket of goods that they consume, been much higher than the 2% rate that is their supposed target. Rudy is a ranter, and extremely angry about the Fed, and its apologists, but manages to remain readable and rational. He ire is mainly aimed at the bankers, such as Jamie Dimon, who have benefited so enormously from the Fed&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;L. Randall&amp;nbsp;Wray&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Randy Wray is a thoughtful proponent of Modern Monetary Theory (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt;). 
I don&amp;#8217;t know where his position is on the wide spectrum of economic thought.
He is influenced by Chartalism, a sort of precursor of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt;. 
There is a general acceptance of the idea that one way or another inflation comes about
because demand outstrips supply. For a commodity, such as oil, it&amp;#8217;s clear that if 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OPEC&lt;/span&gt; restrict supply, and the rest of the world does not do something to damp down demand,
the price of oil will go up. When the world comes out of an enforced shutdown resulting
from a pandemic, activity can go up for quite a long time before factories run out of
capacity and start raising prices, rather than raising production. Wray argues that 
the government can create money out of nowhere, and raise spending on important
public works until we get to a point where inflation starts to bite, whereupon the government
can cut it off by taxing producers to bring demand back into equilibrium with&amp;nbsp;supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summarizing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; in a paragraph is a challenge, and there are a lot of subtle implications of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; that I have failed to mention, but the above is my understanding of how it works.
Of course, it relies on the government doing the right thing, and increasing taxes is never 
popular, so those who argue that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; will inevitably lead to runaway inflation might well be right, but I think that the basic theory is not as bonkers as most mainstream economists portray it to&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Treasury&amp;nbsp;Orthodoxy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not at all sure if the Treasury really does believe in balanced budgets.
At the very least, I imagine that it would feel very comfortable with a budget deficit, 
as a percentage, around the same level as the potential growth rate of the economy (so
the debt would be stable as a percent of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time, central banks and western treasuries were mostly concerned about getting inflation higher (this is Rudy&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;bête noir&lt;/em&gt;). I suspect that they think that they believe that as long as governments have a credible plan for repaying, in real terms, debts they have run up, currencies will remain strong and inflation will remain&amp;nbsp;subdued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Truss/Kwarteng &amp;#8216;mini-budget&amp;#8217; of last autumn was a sort of aberration from this, 
justified as an assault on a sort of straw man caricature of 1920&amp;#8217;s treasury&amp;nbsp;orthodoxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far be it from me to speak on behalf of the Treasury. Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwateng talked about how the Treasury was &amp;#8216;holding back&amp;#8217; the economy by promoting austerity. 
My suspicion is that this is totally wrong, although it is certainly the case that chancellors like George Osborne had a fetish for reducing the gap between spending and tax revenues, which, surely, had a baleful effect on the growth rate of the economy.
In a way, Kwateng&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8216;mini-budget&amp;#8217; was an endorsement of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt;. Like Dick Cheney, Kwateng believed that &amp;#8220;Deficits don&amp;#8217;t matter.&amp;#8221; What&amp;#8217;s odd is that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt;, in a disguised form, such as Corbyn&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8216;Green New Deal&amp;#8217; (&lt;a href="https://theecologist.org/2019/may/31/corbyn-and-radical-green-new-deal"&gt;https://theecologist.org/2019/may/31/corbyn-and-radical-green-new-deal&lt;/a&gt;) was considered by Starmer so radical and quasi-Marxist that he dumped it immediately.
Rachel Reeves could be Gordon Brown in drag, and is just as&amp;nbsp;orthodox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bill&amp;nbsp;Gross&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill is possibly the most successful bond investor of all time. He has ridden the long wave of collapsing interest rates that is attributed to Paul Volcker for forty years. 
I have a sneaky suspicion that he was just better at juicing his returns by selling volatility than any of his peers, but he&amp;#8217;s clearly a smart guy.
But he&amp;#8217;s wrong! Years ago he described gilts as &amp;#8216;sitting on a bed of nitroglycerine&amp;#8217;. Well,
they still haven&amp;#8217;t blown up. Well, maybe for a few days when we had a maniac for a chancellor, but not really. Can that go on forever? Probably not. If something cannot go on forever, will it stop. Yes it&amp;nbsp;will!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lacy&amp;nbsp;Hunt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lacy Hunt an economist who has consistently forecast falling inflation, since the 1980&amp;#8217;s, and has been consistently right. Nobody quite understands his reasoning, but they admire his consistency and his unassuming charm. (As I understand it, his main argument is that interest rates, in a world where saving and investment are in balance, have to equal the marginal utility of capital; as the population gets older and no more low-hanging fruit remains to be picked, from the tree of innovation, this marginal utility declines. The net result is a slowing down of the economy and a falling inflation rate. I have not done his arguments justice. This quote from Barron&amp;#8217;s may&amp;nbsp;help:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Hunt, over indebted economies have certain telltale characteristics. Jumps in economic growth, inflation, and high-grade bond yields prove short-lived because debt constrains economic activity. Difficulties in making debt payments, in turn, push economies into frequent downturns and hurt productivity. Monetary policy loses effectiveness as the debt overhang stunts expansion of the money supply, slows monetary velocity, and quenches the animal spirits of producers and confidence of&amp;nbsp;consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/no-inflation-in-sight-say-two-bond-masters-1455944528"&gt;https://www.barrons.com/articles/no-inflation-in-sight-say-two-bond-masters-1455944528&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Jeff&amp;nbsp;Snider&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff Snider is, in terms of his embracing of the web, podcasts, his public profile, the opposite of Lacy Hunt. He also concludes that inflation (and the Fed) is a paper tiger. 
I am reluctant to even try to summarize his argument, but my attempt goes like&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;most dollars in the world are created outside the control of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;, and are just ledger entries on banks and shadow banks reflecting contracts denominated in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; but not involving &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; banks other than in a residual clearing&amp;nbsp;function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the Efficient Market Hypothesis works, and the very subdued long-term yields on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasuries give us confidence that any spikes in inflation will be short-lived. Jeff is a good guy, but he is in danger of over-selling his theory. Rates have gone up since the pandemic, and are not guaranteed to go back down to two and a bit percent again in the short term. Many commentators argue that the 2% Fed inflation target was arbitrary and would benefit from being updated to 3 or&amp;nbsp;4%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Fred 30 year yield since 1977" src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=12laL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snider could simply say &amp;#8220;Markets have changed their mind, and are now forecasting moderate 
inflation,&amp;#8221; but he somehow doesn&amp;#8217;t. I guess this is a tough thing for a bond analyst to say.
Putting out research reports saying &amp;#8220;sell everything&amp;#8221; doesn&amp;#8217;t work too&amp;nbsp;well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Milton&amp;nbsp;Friedman&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, Nigel Lawson died. He was an adherent of Monetarism, which argued that inflation was, as Friedman said &amp;#8220;Always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.&amp;#8221;
Friedman came up with this crackpot idea after working on statistics for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; money supply over many decades. Even though Monetarism isn&amp;#8217;t taken seriously as an alternative to Keynesianism (as subsequently updated), it does seem to be the basis of the idea that
governments can leave the control of inflation to central&amp;nbsp;banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a huge admirer of Milton Friedman, but I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that he promoted this theory to overshadow his exact contemporary, Paul Samuelson, the arch Keynesian.
The following is a chart of M2 vs &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PCE&lt;/span&gt; inflation (the Fed&amp;#8217;s preferred measure). Even with the famous &amp;#8216;long and variable lags&amp;#8217; fudge factor, the money supply growth simply does not correlate with&amp;nbsp;inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="M2 and inflation" src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=12lmH"&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kuppy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harris Kupperman invented what he called &amp;#8220;Project&amp;nbsp;Zimbabwe&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will happen to inflation? I have no idea, but I know that the experts above will 
not change their predictions, or theories, whatever happens.
Maybe we should just accept that it is too complex to&amp;nbsp;predict.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>The Twitter Files</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/the-twitter-files.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-04-02T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-04-04T20:01:13+01:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2023-04-02:/the-twitter-files.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Sunday  2, April&amp;nbsp;2023&lt;/h1&gt;

But even narcissistic psychopaths have been known to do some good sometimes.

may be well known in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;).
These reveal, at the very least, an extremely high-handed attitude on the part of
the content moderators in the Twitter of old, before it became a privately owned
plaything of Elon&amp;nbsp;Musk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a pity that this was not just a big data dump of everything, and that it 
was released to a selective subset of journalists who might have been persuaded
to turn a blind eye to some data. It seems to me clear that the release was made
in an attempt to cast the previous management in a bad light, and Elon in a good&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coverage of the misdeeds of Twitter are readily available from a web search.
(I recommend Yacy, the distributed search engine, but at the very least try a 
few in addition to Google and Bing). A representative example is the story of
how tweets from Brett Giroir were deleted at the request of Scott Gottlieb.
The latter was on Twitter&amp;#8217;s board, and also happens to be a board member of 
Pfizer. Oh, the tweet from Giroir said that natural immunity resulting from 
catching &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COVID&lt;/span&gt; might be superior to that resulting from vaccination. He also
tweeted that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COVID&lt;/span&gt; did not represent a severe risk to a child under 11 years of age.
That was deleted&amp;nbsp;too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that Twitter curates content, and suppresses content which it doesn&amp;#8217;t like.
That&amp;#8217;s fine, but it has a quasi-monopoly position, and using this can control 
what appears in the mainstream media. A lack of competing opinions in the mainstream
media is well understood to be a threat to democracy, and is (notionally) blocked
in democratic regimes. It just seems wrong that we tolerate it in social media, 
which still pretends that it is &amp;#8216;just a platform&amp;#8217; which carries the views of its members
without exercising editorial&amp;nbsp;control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The plight of&amp;nbsp;academics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2023/03/01/oxford-universitys-other-diversity-crisis"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt;
explains how tough it is to be an academic at Oxford.
The subject of the article, Henry, has been seriously let down by the university, and is deserving of sympathy.
I feel sorry for the guy, but my sympathy is tempered with the thought that it&amp;#8217;s hardly a secret
that going into academia is a very unattractive financial prospect.
A decade ago, I met up with a contemporary of mine who almost the only one of our cohort to 
go straight into a permanent academic job. He was still doing it several decades later,
and made a trip to use the Bodlian Library most weekends to do research, which he much preferred 
to&amp;nbsp;teaching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing he mentioned to me was that Oxford housing was effectively unaffordable to anyone on a 
normal academic salary. I was so far out of academia myself, I had no idea what level he was talking about.
In my day there were hardly any professors, but I have noticed that they are now much more common than 
they used to be. Anyway, he said he would refuse a post, even if&amp;nbsp;offered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is that we are producing far, far too many PhDs (and DPhils). Academics need PhDs, 
especially in the sciences, to help them boost their publishing output. 
In the past, a PhD could be completed in a moderate time: after a four-year undergraduate course, 
submitting a DPhil thesis within six terms was a wholly realistic goal, especially when one&amp;#8217;s supervisor
chose a project that was well chosen.
It is interesting that Henry ended up in academic administration. There always seem to be well-paid jobs
in academic administration. In the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;, the population of academic administrators, and their salaries, 
has exploded. Maybe they are all academics manqué, and wish to extract their revenge on those they would
have&amp;nbsp;become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting that the article says that the big problem is that academically successful students
from poorer backgrounds get suckered in to embarking on this career path. As someone who got a scholarship
to Oxford from an very poor household, I can fully understand how this happens. 
Kids whose parents went to Oxford know that becoming an academic is, for the vast majority, a major
mistake. The competition to get a permanent academic job is probably close to the sort of 
competition there is for jobs at investment banks. Winning the competition leads to years of gruelling,
unsatisfying work (mostly), but at least as an investment banker you get a big financial&amp;nbsp;compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to blame academics. When they take on a PhD student, they are only offering the student 
an opportunity they were given themselves at an earlier stage in their career, and for some academics,
their ability and disposition makes being a university lecturer the optimal career choice.
The problem is that a lot go into it who are either not suited, psychologically, or not sufficiently 
gifted academically. The tails of a normal distribution stretch out a long way in both directions. 
I realized fairly early on into my PhD that I probably wasn&amp;#8217;t going to make it, which gave me a shot
at having a career which was more suited to my&amp;nbsp;abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even in the 1980s it was universal for all corporate recruiters to mandate an aptitude test. 
In universities, it&amp;#8217;s sufficient to pass exams and submit a thesis of the requisite standard. 
Maybe universities could learn something from the corporate world. 
I would probably help if they gave candidates for PhD programs some statistics on how many
of their predecessors actually make it. 
The problem is that if you are a candidate for a PhD program at a prestigious university 
you have probably never failed at anything you have previously attempted in your life 
up to that point, so you probably lack the humility to recognize that better men than 
you have failed to make it to a professorship, and that jobs in the real world are frequently both better paid and more&amp;nbsp;rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Deficits don’t matter. Much.</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/deficits-dont-matter-much.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-03-31T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-04-21T12:10:05+01:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2023-03-31:/deficits-dont-matter-much.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Friday 31, March&amp;nbsp;2023&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Deficits don&amp;#8217;t matter, or do&amp;nbsp;they?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m late to the game, but since I have a platform, I thought I&amp;#8217;d write something about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt;. 
Well, &amp;#8216;platform&amp;#8217; is pushing it. More of a wobbly stool but, whatever!
I think journalists are obsessed about the technology, because they perceive it to be real, and growing threat to their jobs. Somehow, this threat is more real to them than the threat of overseas factories taking jobs
away from people who work in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; factories. If, indeed, there are even any&amp;nbsp;left!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked Bard (the Google ChatGPT engine) the following question: &amp;#8220;Write a piece about the why the unfunded liabilities of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Federal government will result in inflation in the coming decades.&amp;#8221;
This is the answer I&amp;nbsp;got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States Federal government has a large and growing number of unfunded liabilities, including Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. These programs are projected to cost more and more money in the coming decades, as the population ages and the number of beneficiaries increases. If the government does not take steps to address these liabilities, they will put a strain on the economy and could lead to&amp;nbsp;inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way that unfunded liabilities can lead to inflation is by increasing the demand for goods and services. As the number of retirees increases, they will demand more goods and services, such as healthcare, housing, and food. This increased demand will put upward pressure on prices, leading to&amp;nbsp;inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way that unfunded liabilities can lead to inflation is by increasing the supply of money. The government will need to borrow money to finance these programs, and this borrowing will increase the money supply. A larger money supply can lead to inflation, as there is more money chasing the same amount of goods and&amp;nbsp;services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the government does not take steps to address its unfunded liabilities, they could have a significant impact on the economy. Inflation could make it more difficult for businesses to operate and for people to afford goods and services. This could lead to a recession, which would have a negative impact on everyone in the&amp;nbsp;country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government needs to take steps to address its unfunded liabilities. One option is to raise taxes. This would generate more revenue that could be used to fund these programs. Another option is to cut spending. This would reduce the amount of money that the government needs to borrow, which would help to reduce the deficit and the national&amp;nbsp;debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government also needs to make changes to these programs so that they are more sustainable in the long run. For example, Social Security could be modified so that benefits are tied to the rate of inflation. This would help to ensure that beneficiaries are able to maintain their standard of living as prices&amp;nbsp;rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government needs to take action now to address its unfunded liabilities. If it does not, these liabilities could have a significant impact on the economy in the coming&amp;nbsp;decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I&amp;#8217;d try to get the other side of the story by asking the following question: &amp;#8220;Say why deficits don&amp;#8217;t matter to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; federal government, even though the costs of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid are all going to exceed the ability of the government to raise taxes or to save money by cutting other government programs such as defence spending or overseas aid.&amp;#8221; This is what I&amp;nbsp;got:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; federal government has a large and growing national debt, which is currently over $30 trillion. This debt is the result of years of budget deficits, which are the difference between what the government takes in and what it&amp;nbsp;spends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of reasons why the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; federal government doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to be worried about its growing national debt. First, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; dollar is the world&amp;#8217;s reserve currency, which means that it is the currency that most international transactions are conducted in. This gives the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; government a lot of flexibility in financing its debt, as it can simply print more money to pay its&amp;nbsp;bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; economy is the largest and most powerful in the world. This means that there is always a demand for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; government bonds, even if the interest rates on those bonds are relatively&amp;nbsp;low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; government has a long history of managing its debt. Even though the national debt has been growing in recent years, it is still a relatively small percentage of the country&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are a number of risks associated with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; federal government&amp;#8217;s growing national debt. First, if the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; economy were to slow down, it would be more difficult for the government to raise taxes or to cut spending. This could lead to a larger budget deficit and a larger national&amp;nbsp;debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, if the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; dollar were to lose its status as the world&amp;#8217;s reserve currency, it would become more expensive for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; government to borrow money. This could lead to higher interest rates on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; government bonds, which would make it more expensive for the government to finance its&amp;nbsp;debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, if the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; government were to default on its debt, it would damage its reputation and make it more difficult for it to borrow money in the future. This could lead to higher interest rates on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; government bonds and a larger national&amp;nbsp;debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; federal government&amp;#8217;s growing national debt is a cause for concern. However, the government has a number of tools at its disposal to manage its debt, and it is unlikely that the government will default on its debt in the near&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I thought was interesting was that Bard has shown itself to be a deficit hawk. If it managed a fixed income portfolio, it would surely be a bond vigilante. I picked the answer which best defended the proposition that &amp;#8220;deficits don&amp;#8217;t matter&amp;#8221; but the nearest I got was basically &amp;#8220;they don&amp;#8217;t matter, at least in the short term,&amp;#8221; which is hardly a full-blooded&amp;nbsp;defence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may be wondering how I picked on this subject to ask Bard about. 
Well, I am interested in the topic, as you are probably painfully aware,
but my attention was particularly drawn to the topic because of an interview
with Brian Riedl in David Beckworth&amp;#8217;s show, &lt;em&gt;Macro Musings&lt;/em&gt;. 
You can read the transcript &lt;a href="https://www.mercatus.org/macro-musings/brian-riedl-current-and-future-outlook-us-public-finance-and-budget-reform"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and 
I&amp;#8217;m sure you can follow links on that page to the actual audio version.
Riedl&amp;#8217;s piece can be read &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/03/09/bidens-5-trillion-tax-blowout-still-leaves-soaring-red-ink/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
Riedl looks like another small-state, libertarian shill, but I think he&amp;#8217;s a bit more than that. 
He was equally critical of both major parties, saying that the promises of both parties to 
do what needs to be done are not credible: the Republicans to raise taxes and the Democrats to cut spending. 
This is all very familiar to anyone who has read David Stockton&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8216;The Great Deformation&amp;#8217;, 
or followed Bill Gross. 
All I can say it that things have worked out pretty well so far for governments with big funded and unfunded liabilities, 
including Japan, which is still in this game after thirty&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Super Dario and a Marxist take on inflation</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/super-dario-and-a-marxist-take-on-inflation.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-03-30T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-04-04T20:01:13+01:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2023-03-30:/super-dario-and-a-marxist-take-on-inflation.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Thursday 30, March&amp;nbsp;2023&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Super&amp;nbsp;Dario&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflation in wages is how you keep score in the match between labour and capital.
For most of history, labour didn&amp;#8217;t manage to find the back of the net.
The Black Death in the mid 14th Century gave labour its first opportunity, and it did
manage to score a goal, but it was an expensive one.
As a result of 75 to 200 million people dying, labour temporarily got the upper hand,
and managed to get an increased financial reward.
It didn&amp;#8217;t last forever though, and labour had various setbacks later, including Enclosure, which was the result of increasing livestock farming, which could be carried out by landowners with much less labour
input: the factory automation of its day. I&amp;#8217;d better admit that I stopped studying history at school at age 14,
and the accuracy of the above account may be considered simplistic, or even plain wrong.
I&amp;#8217;m happy to be corrected and  revise this&amp;nbsp;bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, later on, as the Industrial Revolution got going, the factors of production: land, capital and labour, were more equally matched. As I understand it, labour got the upper hand (i.e. inflation) in the middle of the 19th Century, to fall back at the end of it, with various surges from then on, including immediately after wars, where the loss of manpower (literally, in those cases) resulted in increased wages for those who survived. Arguably, the Industrial Revolution itself was the result of a shortage of labour. These things work both ways, and we may even have the Jevon&amp;#8217;s Paradox at work: the relative cheapness of labour compared to capital, the price of which was being bid up, resulted in more consumption and, eventually, a higher&amp;nbsp;price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming up to today, the most influential generation has been the Boomers. They found themselves in great demand in the 60&amp;#8217;s and 70&amp;#8217;s, when they first entered the workforce, with the crucial difference that their numbers gave them political power. The economy was run hot, domestic demand went up, as high tariffs and the high cost of transport protected domestic industry. This was a new phase, because labour had political as well as pure bargaining power at this stage.
With this combination, which was not unique to Britain, wages went up steadily, but since labour is the biggest input into almost every price, prices went up almost as quickly. Eventually, the wage-price spiral got to a point where the majority of the population wanted it to stop, and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; elected Margaret Thatcher (well, her party, strictly), and she carried through a brutal set of policies to tip the power back into the hands of capital. By destroying whole industries, and the labour they employed, inflation was brought under control, but at a cost which eventually lead to a change of government, but barely a change of&amp;nbsp;policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A national economy is a complicated machine, and oil supply  and the exchange rate
all had an impact on inflation.  The money supply, and interest rates, certainly had an influence, but maybe
not so much as the simplistic accounts of how inflation was got under control make&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above story is (roughly) what I took away from Dario Perkin&amp;#8217;s appearance on The Market Huddle. You can see it &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVvJID1fUMo"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; but you&amp;#8217;re better off getting it as a podcast. Dario&amp;#8217;s supercycle theory has the great benefit that it&amp;#8217;s a coherent narrative. It might even be&amp;nbsp;right!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the punchline is that we are, once more, entering a supercycle where labour starts to get the upper hand. Perkins doesn&amp;#8217;t think that we&amp;#8217;re going back to the 70&amp;#8217;s, not least because the Boomers now are old and want higher returns to capital. They&amp;#8217;ve gone from being employees to being rentiers. Perkins argues that we will see more persistent inflation, that 2% will start to be viewed as a floor, not a ceiling any longer,
and the bond bulls will not give up for a long while yet, not least because nobody younger than me can remember anything resembling a bond bear market.
He also states that the correlation between bond and equity prices will be much less negatively correlated (i.e. in future, we&amp;#8217;ll see bonds and stocks move together much more of the time), which will drive down the demand for bonds as an equity hedge.  I am not sure about the argument here, I think it was because of the periodic surges of inflation he predicts, which will reduce increase the risk premium on bonds, which will lower prices in a way uncorrelated with equity&amp;nbsp;prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russ Roberts, an economist, used to say that economics should be more like history, and less like physics.
The underlying agents (people, not protons) were intrinsically less predictable, so a mathematical approach
could never have the success it has had in the physical sciences. Dario seems to be of that school of macro&amp;nbsp;economists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marx&amp;#8217;s Labour Theory of Value says that capital is just deferred labour (as a factor of production), and that the value of everything is
just a measure of the amount of labour that went into making it. 
Value is not really measurable, and doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be the same as price. Only the marginal buyer pays a price equal to the value to him of 
the thing he consumes.
Marx&amp;#8217;s theory is wrong, but clearly labour is a very important factor of production in a service-based economy, like that of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; or (especially) the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;.
At some point, labour will get the upper hand, and we&amp;#8217;ll see inflation. 
At this point the conflict between preventing banks failing and keeping a lid on inflation will start to get interesting.
My money is on the former, so brace yourself for a return to the&amp;nbsp;1970&amp;#8217;s!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Just because its a conspiracy theory doesn’t mean it’s not a fact!</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/just-because-its-a-conspiracy-theory-doesnt-mean-its-not-a-fact.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-03-29T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-03-29T22:04:25+01:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2023-03-29:/just-because-its-a-conspiracy-theory-doesnt-mean-its-not-a-fact.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Wednesday 29, March&amp;nbsp;2023&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Kicking the&amp;nbsp;nickel&lt;/h2&gt;

newsletter for free. You can get the posts via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine.rss"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
It&amp;#8217;s worth it. Trust&amp;nbsp;me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kicking the&amp;nbsp;nickel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked last week about the discovery that some nickel belonging to JPMorgan Chase &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Co., which it used to support nickel futures trading on the London Metal Exchange, was actually just rocks. The nickel — I mean, rocks — had been sitting in an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LME&lt;/span&gt;-affiliated warehouse for years; its role in life was to support nickel futures trading, not to be turned into batteries or cars or whatever. “The nickel worked perfectly well for those purposes — JPMorgan’s derivative contracts traded and paid off normally — for years, even though the nickel was not in fact nickel, just bags of rocks,” I wrote. I went&amp;nbsp;on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then one day a warehouse worker, like, stubbed his toe against JPMorgan’s nickel and was like “hmm that’s not the sound nickel makes when you kick it” and opened the bags and found rocks. And then the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LME&lt;/span&gt; dutifully reported that some nickel was not nickel, and JPMorgan’s nickel warrants were transformed into rocks&amp;nbsp;warrants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a footnote, I clarified that I was just imagining this scenario, and that “I have no idea how the fraud was discovered and never want to find out, unless the real story is funnier than this one.” Do I have good news for you! Bloomberg News&amp;nbsp;reports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revelation that about $2 million of “nickel” on the London Metal Exchange was actually just bags of stones has thrown a spotlight on the sprawling web of warehouses and metal stashes underpinning the billions of dollars of derivatives traded daily on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LME&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past week, warehouse staff from Busan in South Korea to Genoa in Italy have rushed to check tens of thousands of two-ton bags of nickel – in some cases, by literally kicking&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LME&lt;/span&gt; advised warehouse operators to wear steel toe-capped boots for safety, one person who received the instructions said. The rule of thumb: If it hurts when you kick it, it’s probably&amp;nbsp;nickel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mass inspection, which also included more carefully calibrated checks like weighing and scanning the bags, came after the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LME&lt;/span&gt; last week announced it had discovered “irregularities” in nine nickel&amp;nbsp;contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is extremely satisfying. Isn’t high finance great? One day you are sitting at your computer using sophisticated software to trade millions of dollars of abstract financial contracts in milliseconds to bet on global macroeconomic conditions. Then your boss taps you on the shoulder and is like “hey sorry you have to leave the desk for a few days to go kick a few thousand bags of nickel.” No no no I’m kidding, the futures traders and nickel-kickers are different people, but they are all interconnected in the elaborate system of global finance, which requires both high-speed data networks and also steel-toed boots for&amp;nbsp;safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two possible explanations: either the bags were already full of stones when they were first delivered into Access World’s Rotterdam warehouse, or someone sneaked into the warehouse to steal the&amp;nbsp;nickel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access World is leaning toward the second theory, according to people familiar with the matter, because it has a record of the material being weighed when it first entered the&amp;nbsp;warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See I would have assumed that stealing nickel and substituting rocks in transit would make a lot of sense, while sneaking into a warehouse to bring in rocks and take out nickel would be insane, but (1) what do I know and (2) I am desperate to see the movie of&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing that doesn&amp;#8217;t totally make sense to me is why kicking rocks doesn&amp;#8217;t hurt! And, for that matter, why whoever substituted rocks for the nickel didn&amp;#8217;t (for example) use nickle-plated
sheets or bars of steel.
The other thing that doesn&amp;#8217;t makes sense to me is why nickel is so expensive compared to iron. They are practically next to each other in the Periodic Table, 
and so their binding energy per nucleon will be similar, so there should be loads of both in the earth. Well, there is in the core. I have no idea why the 
crust has less Ni than Fe (or even if that&amp;#8217;s actually&amp;nbsp;true).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="quo"&gt;&amp;#8216;&lt;/span&gt;That which can be securitized will be&amp;nbsp;securitized&amp;#8217;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/pn_08_2.pdf"&gt;This paper&lt;/a&gt; is Hyman Minsky, who died in 1996, predicting that Volker in his misguided attempts to control inflation by 
raising interest rates would result in banks ceasing to function as principals in the lending process.
We all know about securitization now, because we&amp;#8217;ve lived through the Global Financial Crisis, which it created.
What I had not realized is that Minsky, in 1987 saw how it would all pan out.
This is all explained &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/episode-163-l-80479169"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks, which we are constantly told are well regulated and bombproof now we&amp;#8217;ve learned the lessons of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GFC&lt;/span&gt;, have shifted a lot of the risk off their 
balance sheet, but still manage to fail, even holding mainly &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury securities on the asset side of their balance sheet.
I think that there are a lot of &amp;#8216;shadow banks&amp;#8217; which will have a lot more trouble in the coming year. 
Probably, the biggest problem will be in private equity and maybe some of the more exotic ETFs ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARKK&lt;/span&gt;,&amp;nbsp;anybody)?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>$700 baby socks!</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/700-baby-socks.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-03-27T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-03-28T17:03:11+01:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2023-03-27:/700-baby-socks.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Monday 27, March&amp;nbsp;2023&lt;/h1&gt;

The basic thesis is that governments in many parts of the world have policies which are highly favourable to 
what we have to call &amp;#8216;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UHNW&lt;/span&gt; households&amp;#8217; (&amp;#8216;Ultra-high net worth&amp;#8217;). These are the people who run &amp;#8216;family offices&amp;#8217;
and travel everywhere by private jet.
It came out the other day that although our prime minister had paid over &amp;pound;1M in taxes in the last few years, 
his average tax rate was less than 20%, somewhat lower than a full-time worker receiving the adult minimum wage would pay
(if you include both flavours of&amp;nbsp;NICs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AT1s behaved as designed (and as should have been&amp;nbsp;expected)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was at a conference thing where some bond guys got upset that
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AT1&lt;/span&gt; (&amp;#8216;CoCo or Contingent Convertibles) holders got wiped out ahead of equity.
Well, their argument is &amp;#8216;bonds are senior to equity, we should get paid first.&amp;#8217;
But actually, it ain&amp;#8217;t necessarily so, as Matt Levine explains, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-03-20/ubs-got-credit-suisse-for-almost-nothing?leadSource=uverify%20wall"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AT1&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s say in their prospectus that they will go to zero if
the bank&amp;#8217;s capital drops below a certain threshold, I think 7% or more of a bank liabilities.  This happened in the case of Credit Suisse: they got zeroed,
the equity holders got a tiny bit. Depositors and other creditors were &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This point has been made in a few&amp;nbsp;places. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;StackOverflow got going too late to help me to be more productive as a programmer.
I have used it quite a bit to help me figure out the fairly trivial coding problems that I encounter
these days in my programming dotage. 
I suspect that the value of StackOverflow is much greater than is generally acknowledged. 
Nobody gets hired for saying that his approach to solving a tricky programming problem is to look up
the answer on StackOverflow, but &amp;#8212; I suspect &amp;#8212; that this is most often what happens.
Managers are happy that software gets written, programmers learn good new techniques, 
new tools and languages get adopted quicker as knowledge about how to use them diffuses quicker.

They embody equity-bond duality (like wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics).
They pay a coupon and (for all I know) treated as a bond for tax purposes (i.e. interest cost is deducted to compute taxable profit), but are at the back of the seniority queue when
it comes to paying out to those who have funded the business (i.e. creditors and&amp;nbsp;shareholders). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to know more about how they work, read Matt Levine. You get an authoritative explanation with laughs thrown in.
A lot of people are upset about what happened to Crédit Suisse&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AT1&lt;/span&gt; bonds.
They are in the news. Read more &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4f0c9cc8-192c-4b2b-bd78-4943d23b17a3"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not concerned with what happened. I&amp;#8217;m more concerned that laws are passed that 99.9% of the population doesn&amp;#8217;t know anything about, that they cannot imagine being affected by. (When I say laws, I include all regulations put out by regulatory authorities, which are extremely numerous.)
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AT1&lt;/span&gt; bonds exist only because some banker lobbied for them to have the properties they have. How exactly they behave, to the extent that it differs from regular bonds or equity, creates winners and losers. Given the invisibility of these regulations to the general public, one can be fairly certain that the set of losers is equivalent to the set that is labeled &amp;#8220;the general&amp;nbsp;public.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another regulation was introduced this week. It&amp;#8217;s called the &lt;em&gt;Bank Term Funding Program&lt;/em&gt;. 
It sounds extremely innocuous. Who could object to a program whose function is to provide funding to banks? &amp;#8216;Term funding&amp;#8217; sounds complicated (long or short?), but funding a bank makes the depositors better off, so all good, right? The Fed thinks so: it&amp;#8217;s website states: &amp;#8220;The Bank Term Funding Program (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTFP&lt;/span&gt;) was created to support &lt;strong&gt;American businesses and households&lt;/strong&gt; [my emphasis] by making additional funding available to eligible depository institutions to help assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors.&amp;#8221; It&amp;#8217;s nothing to do with bailing out the banks, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone once said, capitalism with bankruptcy is like religion without sin. The Fed does what it does best: it rewarded bankers who took more risks than their peers, it saved those banks from failing and as a consequence denied the other banks an opportunity to grow their business. The end result is worse-run banks and a bigger appetite for risk-taking.
It&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;moral hazard&lt;/em&gt; as they term it in the insurance business. (You may be less careful about leaving your gas on because if your house is blown up the insurance company pays for it to be rebuilt. In practice, you are probably fairly careful because of considerations which go beyond the purely&amp;nbsp;financial.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does this happen, again and again? Because the rational voter knows that even if he makes the effort to understand, his voice will be drowned by the amplified voices of a very concentrated group of beneficiaries shouting into the law-makers ear (and pouring money into their campaign&amp;nbsp;fund).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is to be done? I&amp;#8217;m not sure that anything would make a big difference. We cannot turn the clock back to the time when bankers considered that any asset beyond  short-term commercial paper was unacceptably risky, but we should definitely reconsider the fiction that government bonds are risk free. In a time of interest rate volatility, a thirty-year bond is not safe for a bank to hold, even if it does pay a term premium via its&amp;nbsp;yield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Institutions need leadership.
That leadership needs to be focused on the goals of the organization.
Obviously, a leader needs to take his followers with him, but he cannot
afford to be held hostage by them, or their ideas, at least if those
ideas conflict with the aims of the&amp;nbsp;organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding an organization&amp;#8217;s goals is not always clear. 
Some have clear constitutions and founding documents.
Others, especially very ancient ones, evolve and have a purpose which
is not always immediately apparent and might even seem at odds with modern&amp;nbsp;morality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demise of religion has turned us all into freethinkers.
We no longer fear censure by religious authorities, and exclusion 
from the community of faith that in previous times was at the very 
least a meal ticket and in some cases was essential for admission
to all the positions of power in&amp;nbsp;society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is that it&amp;#8217;s much less fun being a leader now. Whether one
leads the National Trust, or the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt;, or the Army, or even the government.
The Right argues that this erodes the effectiveness of the institutions. 
That the original purpose of it is destroyed in the service of promoting
gender equality, or trans rights or whatever the cause du jour is.
The counter argument is that it&amp;#8217;s good that institutions can
adapt themselves to the changing moral framework of society without
having to be destroyed and replaced. After all, they were, presumably
created to reflect the priorities of the time they were created.
If the army had the same code of leadership now that it had 
in Wellington&amp;#8217;s time it would, surely, never attract any&amp;nbsp;soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, sadly, bound up with the increasing polarization of society.
Someone like Trump actively stirs up conflict to advance his own 
agenda, without much regard for the objective truth of his remarks.
As a response to this, for example, we now instinctively reject 
his assertions, even when they might well be true. One case in
point is his speculation that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COVID&lt;/span&gt;-19 was the result of a &amp;#8216;lab 
leak&amp;#8217; in Wuhan, something that now is accepted as likely, 
at least by one major &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; government&amp;nbsp;agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pendulum swings, but  the Overton Window also slides up and down according to the direction of the winds of cultural change.
In the 1970&amp;#8217;s the power of the unions went unchallenged, even by 
Margaret Thatcher, the new leader of the Conservative Party. 
But as a consensus built that this power was excessive it was challenged, 
and laws ended up being passed which pushed the pendulum back, and the Window
closed. Although wokeness now seems impossible to challenge, its equivalent in the past century was not. It seems likely that it will not be in the future, and surely if our institutions have survived for hundreds of years, they will tolerate a few years of imposed&amp;nbsp;wokeness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to argue that the constrained decision-making that modern sensitivities impose on ancient institutions does not impose a degree of inefficiency. After all, democracy itself is highly inefficient and messy: Mussolini made the trains run on time! 
It challenging to lead a democratic institution, but I think the task is more rewarding, and those leaders who rise to the challenge allow those institutions to endure over&amp;nbsp;centuries.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>It’s getting painful</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/its-getting-painful.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-03-19T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-03-20T08:59:42+00:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2023-03-19:/its-getting-painful.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s get&amp;nbsp;Fis(i)cal!&lt;/h1&gt;

Ben Bernanke admitted as much in an aside to one of his successors (I don&amp;#8217;t have a reference,
it&amp;#8217;s possibly something that Dario Perkins said).
Obviously, jerking around interest rates does transfer demand from person X to person Y. If Person X has a very different propensity to consume than person Y, real overall demand in the economy can change. But this assumes that these differences really exist and are major, and it also assumes that central banks are truly independed of political influence. Well, I think the jury is still out on&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, there is a big problem. Governments have spent like crazy to prevent a global pandemic crashing the world&amp;#8217;s economy. This has cost them a lot, but is 
generally earned them political capital and improved chances of being re-elected.
Allowing central banks to crash the economy, and destroy all those jobs that were saved by muscular fiscal policy would be &amp;#8230; negative for the prospects of governors getting selected for additional terms.&amp;nbsp;Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central banks have been jerking up interest rates for a year or so now, hoping that 
the policy will simply dampen down demand just enough to bring bring job vacancies into line with the actual labour supply.
With the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, First Reserve Bank and Credit Suisse it&amp;#8217;s dawning on them that the soft landing will prove elusive, just as most commentators had&amp;nbsp;predicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, markets will open, and I fear that some other banks will announce that they are closed for withdrawals. Maybe I&amp;#8217;m being too pessimistic, and that this time is different. Well, it is different to 2008, but it&amp;#8217;s similar enough to cause a lot of sleepness nights for&amp;nbsp;bankers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Little platoons of small boats?</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/little-platoons-of-small-boats.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-03-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-03-20T09:00:28+00:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2023-03-18:/little-platoons-of-small-boats.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;2023-03-18&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Small boat&amp;nbsp;crisis&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rishi Sunak made a pitch for the next election by making five promises.
Four of them are the sort of vague political promises that are so 
familiar that it&amp;#8217;s impossible to exactly what they were. I&amp;#8217;m sure that making everyone better off, and giving more money to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; were in there&amp;nbsp;somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the was to stop the &amp;#8216;small boats&amp;#8217; which are the mode of transport of choice of asylum seekers and illegal immigrants alike, these days.
There are technical nits which are easy to pick with this promise.
A few years ago small boats were not an issue, but only because illegals came in on the back of a lorry. Stopping the lorry trade created the small boat crisis, so you could say it 
really was a mess created by the current government, but only in terms of its form, not its&amp;nbsp;substance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, putting some specific promise about small boats seems odd in juxtaposition promises to fix truly big problems (like the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt;). It&amp;#8217;s like having a bucket list which comprises being sent into orbit, visiting the south pole, meeting the Pope and getting a bottle of milk from the Co-Op. I got thinking about this, and suddenly realized&amp;nbsp;that &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is not a list of the most important problems to fix. It&amp;#8217;s a list designed to get him re-elected. Getting re-elected is always prioritized ahead of actually making things&amp;nbsp;better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rishi&amp;#8217;s election strategy is driven by people like  Lynton Crosby and Isaac Levido who got Tony Abbott elected by promising extremely harsh treatment of those who tried to migrate to Australia on small&amp;nbsp;boats. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s pretty clear that either the small boats will not stop (more probable) or they will stop, but those who would have used them find some alternative route: microlight aircraft, gyrocopters? This simply gives more ammunition to fire at &amp;#8216;lefty lawyers&amp;#8217; and civil servants who won&amp;#8217;t get with the program, so that Rishi can go into the election demanding a bigger mandate. It&amp;#8217;s like abortion in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;. No party wants to change anything, because as long as the issue remains live it&amp;#8217;s a huge generator of electoral&amp;nbsp;donations,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the fact that the campaign is so quixotic and that it gets so much newsworthy pushback (from Gary Lineker, amongst others) is a huge benefit, because it keeps news about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; waiting lists and decades of real wage stagnation off the front page. The mainstream can only cover a couple of ongoing issues at a time, and as long as everyone is cheerleading (or booing) a barmy project nobody will think too closely about the tough problems (like getting &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;  performance in developing  maths skills in schools into the top 25 countries&amp;nbsp;globally).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who didn&amp;#8217;t get the title, &amp;#8216;little platoons&amp;#8217; was how Edmund Burke, the &amp;#8216;father of the Conservative Party,&amp;#8217; referred to institutions like the church, local community and family, that bound men together and were bulwark against radical impulses that resulted in the French&amp;nbsp;Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Oil price could hit $107/barrel by end 2023!

Normally, I&amp;#8217;d be delighted to read a piece of research like this, but this note comes from Goldmans.
Don&amp;#8217;t get me wrong, Goldmans employs some bright people.
Commodities are complex, and oil is the most complex of all, because not only is it a tradeable commodity, it&amp;#8217;s highly politicized.
Obviously, in recent times the sanctions against Russia have been covered in a lot of detail, but historically, since the first world war at least, oil has been more than just a source of energy. It has been a source of military&amp;nbsp;dominance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One part of me wants to believe that for a system as complex as the global economy, attempting to forecast rates out beyond a couple of months is essentially impossible. Keynes talked somewhere about the folly of trying to predict what interest rates would be in twenty&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did have something to say about productivity growth over decades-long timescales, so he was not opposed to looking into the future. 
Maybe he just didn&amp;#8217;t want to forecast the value of a variable that is the outturn of so many opposing forces (generically, the supply and demand of funds for&amp;nbsp;lending). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, although I&amp;#8217;m obsessively interested in what will happen to the price of oil, and I am &amp;#8212; deep in my heart &amp;#8212; a bull, I find it hard to believe that the price of oil would go up by around 30% in the course of three quarters when the world economy may quite possibly fall into a deep recession, with a consequential jump in the value of the dollar (the denominator in the price of&amp;nbsp;oil). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the longer term,  to me it seems implausible that the price of oil should not go up. Even if the marginal energy commodity is wind power (or solar), these are likely to be considerably more expensive than today&amp;#8217;s oil price (around $76/barrel), this will still drive up the price of oil. However, commodity prices move in mysterious ways, and anyone who thinks that the price of a basket of commodities should slavishly follow any broad inflation index has been very wrong for a long time.

&lt;p&gt;Rudy Havenstein calls out the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BS&lt;/span&gt;, again.
Today&amp;#8217;s post has a link to a new podcast featuring the heroic David Stockman.
Listen to it &lt;a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/rudy/p/the-total-and-utter-incompetence?r=nmbt&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=email"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I am a huge fan of Stockman, as regular readers will be&amp;nbsp;aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so is &lt;a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/mattstoller/p/fire-the-fed?r=nmbt&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=email"&gt;Matt Stoller&lt;/a&gt;. These commentators give a much more credible account of what is happening at the Fed than the mainstream press. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, they are biased, but there is no such thing as an absence of bias, and basing your news coverage on press releases from official sources is about as biased as you can&amp;nbsp;get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed has too much power, and with that power has come corruption. I would love to think that the market will triumph, but the casino is rigged, so it&amp;#8217;s safer not to place any&amp;nbsp;bets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This a typical couple of paragraphs of a very well-informed criticism of the institution that is, practically, the monetary regulator for the whole&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For thirteen years, from 2008 to 2021, the Fed kept interest rates at zero, and had bought eight trillion dollars of bonds to make money cheaper for banks. One can argue the wisdom of the Fed’s actions, but it happened. This zero interest rate policy (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZIRP&lt;/span&gt;) meant that banks like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVP&lt;/span&gt; got used to free deposits and very low returns on lending and bonds. In 2021, the Fed began encountering serious signs of inflation, and the Fed’s most important job, along with full employment, is to make sure that price levels are relatively stable. To address inflation, it had to tighten financial&amp;nbsp;conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you’d think that the Fed would have thought about the impact of higher interest rates on the banks it regulated and supervised. That’s kind of the whole point of being the supervisor of big banks and the monetary authority. One might even think that the Fed would want to do some sort of, oh I don’t know, stress test, on how higher interest rates could affect banks. But it did not. The Fed did not prepare the banking system for normalizing interest rates, because that would have required constraining what big bank executives wanted to&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar was down by ~0.5% today (103.6). This gave risk assets a boost,  but didn&amp;#8217;t make a huge difference to bonds. Gold and friends were up, but most other commodities were mixed. Even though the authorities probably have enough to sustain &amp;#8216;confidence&amp;#8217;, the equity markets have not given them the seal of&amp;nbsp;approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;#8216;backstopping&amp;#8217; of unlimited deposits at large banks is tantamount to a huge amount of money creation (and &amp;#8216;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;, since those deposits are balanced against Treasuries in banks).
Of course, it is money creation for those who already have millions and who, almost certainly have a very high propensity to save. So, maybe nothing will come of this. One can only&amp;nbsp;hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And no, &lt;a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/thelastbearstanding/p/the-death-of-qt?r=nmbt&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=email"&gt;this is not an original take&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, Goldman&amp;#8217;s take is precisely the&amp;nbsp;opposite:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a repeat of the turmoil 15 years ago seems unlikely. For one, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVB&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s collapse “was a very idiosyncratic situation where you had a bank that had taken a lot of interest rate or duration risk on their portfolio — coupled with the fact that they had a very concentrated deposit base that was very exposed, obviously, to the venture capital community and venture capital portfolio companies that were experiencing these very significant outflows,” Goldman Sachs Research&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;Richard Ramsden&lt;/strong&gt;, business unit leader of the Financials Group, says on the &lt;a href="https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=h1fe65f2b,72de05b6,655f9b40" title="Click to open https://tracking.gs.com/r/?id=h1fe65f2b,72de05b6,655f9b40"&gt;latest episode of Exchanges at Goldman Sachs.&lt;/a&gt; Moreover, “the quality of the assets, so the quality of the collateral, is orders of magnitude better today than it was in 2008,” &lt;strong&gt;Lotfi Karoui&lt;/strong&gt;, chief credit strategist tells host &lt;strong&gt;Allison Nathan&lt;/strong&gt;. “There&amp;#8217;s also greater transparency over its valuations today relative to the run up to the global financial&amp;nbsp;crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This came from an email to me, which doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to exist in its entirety on the web, but the key research (I think) is &lt;a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/stress-among-small-banks-is-likely-to-slow-the-us-economy.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess everyone has an opinion on why &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SIVB&lt;/span&gt; failed. Nobody can read them all, but &lt;a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/netinterest/p/contagion?r=nmbt&amp;amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;amp;utm_medium=email"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; is from a very well-informed&amp;nbsp;commentator.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>20th Anniversary of the Second Gulf War</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/20th-anniversary-of-the-second-gulf-war.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-03-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-03-17T11:49:31+00:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2023-03-16:/20th-anniversary-of-the-second-gulf-war.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; is an oligarchy with unlimited political&amp;nbsp;bribery&amp;#8221;&lt;/h1&gt;

to know whether or not that&amp;#8217;s right, but I do know that this act gave rise to Corbyn and was very helpful to&amp;nbsp;Cameron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the time to assess the success of the war, but clearly the high hopes of the Bush regime in 2003 were not met. The purging of the civil service of members of the Ba&amp;#8217;ath Party, as I understand it, lead to the rise of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISIS&lt;/span&gt;, and the general instability in the Middle East
through much of the&amp;nbsp;2000s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, Saddam was a murderous dictator, but as always the removal of a dictator does not automatically lead to democracy. It is much more likely to result in an even worse regime.
I think that a democracy tends to come about when there there is a struggle between two powerful factions for the control of a country.
The idea that a country can actually be run by its citizens, in a sort of government by opinion poll, is utterly unworkable, in the absence of representatives who are above reproach. 
If there is one thing I have learned in my long life, it is that no human is above reproach, and so true devolution of power to the people is impossible, but if there are two reasonably balanced factions, the outcome of their attempts to enroll as many voters as possible to their cause can lead, slowly to democracy. When a country is invaded, and the existing government disposed of, and replaced by a puppet regime, this clearly cannot&amp;nbsp;happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks went up. The removal of the $250K limit on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FDIC&lt;/span&gt; insurance, and the underwriting of
banks purchases of long-dated treasuries (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; by another name) worked its magic, and 
all risk assets went up, although another bank, in effect, had to be rescued (this time by the megabanks, who are the principle beneficiaries of the Treasury&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8216;backstop&amp;#8217;.)

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been too busy to pay much attention to the budget, but I did hear that the chancellor
has abolished the upper limit on pension savings. My instinct is that people who already have a million pounds are so in pension savings should not obviously be at the front of the queue to get a handout when the total tax take is at a multi-generational high and public services are (we are repeatedly informed) &amp;#8216;crumbling.&amp;#8217; My instinct is that this is a political fix to drive a wedge between senior &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; consultants and the rest of the profession to deflect the full impact of the hospital doctors&amp;#8217; strikes. It seems a very expensive way of achieving a modest and uncertain&amp;nbsp;outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Fixed Interest &amp;#8212; fixed&amp;nbsp;markets&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember an article in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; years ago, where two opposing points of view about fixed income markets were put forward.
One argued that inflation and interest rates had been coming down for several decades, but that now we had hit the zero lower bound, interest rates had nowhere to go but up. Correspondingly, bonds had nowhere to go but down, and that as investors started to realize that there would be a classic market crash, where everyone headed for the emergency escape at once, like the bank runs at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVB&lt;/span&gt; and Signature that we&amp;#8217;ve just seen (although via electronic funds transfer, rather than customers queuing at&amp;nbsp;ATMs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the other argued that this would not happen, because the marginal buyer of gilts (I think the article was about the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; sovereign market, but it could have applied to almost any other) was not buying them because they represented a good investment. He was buying them because regulation more or less compelled him to buy them.
Liability matching for pension funds, heavy risk weighting for almost any other sort of asset for banks, Solvency &lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt; etc. essentially forced many institutions to hold gilts against their will, which would 
prevent any crash. And &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt;. Don&amp;#8217;t forget &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt;: the Bank of England
hoovering up as many gilts as the Treasury can&amp;nbsp;issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well the bullish case won out. We all turned Japanese, and sovereign bond prices continued  their upward trajectory for another decade (probably). It&amp;#8217;s not really surprising that this has happened.
Banks and the finance cabal have terrific political power.
Governments want to spend but not tax. 
Everyone wins when the market price of debt is heavily manipulated. 
Sort of. Except that the subsidy for borrowers is capitalized into the price of houses, pricing anyone born after 1960 out of the market for a comfortable family&amp;nbsp;home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except now, even though real interest rates are deeply negative, entities holding big portfolios of long-dated gilts etc. are looking shaky.
Banks have this one weird trick to flatter their balance sheet (by classifying 30 year gilts as &amp;#8216;Hold to Maturity&amp;#8217;). This has worked &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; up to now, but at some point people will note that creditors may not want to wait 30 years, because, y&amp;#8217;know, inflation at 12% kinda erodes a nominal&amp;nbsp;redemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will this be the end of the endless bull market in bonds? 
Probably not, but, as Herb Stein once said, &amp;#8220;If something cannot go on forever, it must come to a&amp;nbsp;stop.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Markets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley Bank&amp;#8217;s collapse into receivership has continued to spook risk markets.
Commodities have fallen quite sharply, even as interest rates across the maturity spectrum have fallen. Two year yields have continued to fall fast.
The market was moderately convinced that the Fed would pivot six months ago. 
Now they seem totally certain.
They are probably&amp;nbsp;right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is still very high volatility in short term interest&amp;nbsp;rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The markets have had a wake-up call with demise of Silicon Valley Bank (and Signature Bank, although that&amp;#8217;s more of a crypto side show).
For the last year or so we&amp;#8217;ve seen the most vicious inversion of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; yields on record, as the market discounted an endlessly tightening by the Fed (increase in short-term yields) and a steadier yield at the long end (reflecting an expectation that eventually the Fed&amp;#8217;s medicine was going to start&amp;nbsp;working).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="tradingview US10Y-US02Y" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/YdLIsAVf/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market&amp;#8217;s reaction to the collapse of a couple of banks is an assumption, &lt;em&gt;cet. par.&lt;/em&gt; that the Fed will now go easy on its tightening, as market panic starts to do it work.
Equity valuations going down represents a tightening of financial conditions, 
as many companies like to avoid cutting their cash&amp;nbsp;dividends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this really the end of progressive inversion? I somehow doubt it, but maybe it&amp;#8217;s the start of a normalization of interest rates. In a world where many of the drivers of collapsing inflation have fizzled out, we must surely expect longer-dated rates to rise above short term ones.
China now has an aging and shrinking population, and is barely running a trade surplus.
The investment needed to &amp;#8216;decarbonize&amp;#8217; the world economy is going to consume huge
quantities of all sorts of commodities. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; will need some inflation to deliver fiscal drag/bracket creep to push up taxes and push down the net present value of future pension and other&amp;nbsp;liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I&amp;#8217;ve said all that before, and maybe yesterday and today represents another false dawn, but at some point the chart above is going to turn, and you should at least do some research into how to put on a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TUT&lt;/span&gt; spread (or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TUT&lt;/span&gt;, or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TAF&lt;/span&gt;, or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FYT&lt;/span&gt;, or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOB&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOB&lt;/span&gt;, or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BOB&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8212; see &lt;a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/intercommodity-spread.html"&gt;this &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CME&lt;/span&gt; page&lt;/a&gt;).

Although shareholders of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVB&lt;/span&gt; have lost their shirts, everyone else seems to be fine,

percent of that of those who were&amp;nbsp;saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executives seem to have liquidated their stock holdings before anyone knew the bank was in trouble.
Presumably, before they knew that the bank was in trouble, because otherwise it&amp;#8217;d be insider trading,&amp;nbsp;right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;why did the bank decide to lend to the government, rather than to the entrepreneurs who throng&amp;nbsp;California?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;almost nothing has been telegraphed as clearly and for as long as the end of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZIRP&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIRP&lt;/span&gt; and the Fed having to jack up rates to head off roaring inflation. Putting all your assets in &lt;em&gt;long dated&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury Bonds seems beyond stupid. It&amp;#8217;s not as though yields are higher further out down the curve (now and for probably the last 18&amp;nbsp;months),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SIVB&lt;/span&gt; is not an especially big bank, we know that it will be bailed out. That&amp;#8217;s why depositors, who for this bank were very sophisticated companies and individuals, didn&amp;#8217;t care about the $250K &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FIDC&lt;/span&gt; limit. The bank was simply &lt;em&gt;too connected to fail&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, Matt Levine has the most readable take on the story: &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-03-10/startup-bank-had-a-startup-bank-run"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rudy is good&amp;nbsp;too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott just said that this whole Silicon Valley Bank unpleasantness is “bullish” because the Fed will have to cut, or something. It’s mind-numbing, but&amp;nbsp;funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are gonna be working over the weekend now furiously going through the last known bank balance sheets and trying to calculate which banks are safe and which are potentially dangerous. As it turns out, in modern world bank can go tits up, zero from hero in a span of a day. Unless something happens, you will probably see other less safe banks go belly up by&amp;nbsp;monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I urge you to take a look at plaintext accounting, if you have any interest in bookkeeping &lt;a href="#"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, but that&amp;#8217;s not really why I&amp;#8217;m writing this. I want to draw your attention to the fact that there is some 
excellent software written by people who love creating things out of code.
Creativity doesn&amp;#8217;t only apply to graphic art and literature.
A great piece of software is a work of huge creativity, and one that probably gives the author as much satisfaction. I have never created such a masterpiece, but the modest programs I&amp;#8217;ve written have
nevertheless given me a sense of&amp;nbsp;achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, I know,  nobody  is actually interested in bookkeeping. It&amp;#8217;s not like bee keeping, or gardening. It&amp;#8217;s more like vacuum cleaning, 
or rodding drains, but it&amp;#8217;s something that is very useful to know how to do on occasions.
If you do have to do it, it&amp;#8217;s rewarding to use a tool which is  well-designed and well-suited to the job.
Plaintext accounting is a bit like organic farming for bookkeepers. 
It&amp;#8217;s keeping records in a simple, basic, transparent way, without the equivalent of synthetic fertilizers (i.e.
proprietary software). 
If you want to know more, start &lt;a href="https://plaintextaccounting.org/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
It probably appeals more to those with a programming background, because
a knowledge of the text file utilities that programmers find so useful (like grep, awk, sed, 
find, vi, git, diff, make) help in keeping records. If you are interested in learning to code,
it would not be a waste of time learning to use these tools,  because they sure make coding easier too,
when you start to do that&amp;nbsp;seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an awful lot of high quality &amp;#8216;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOSS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217; software out there.

This allows you to import a self-signed certificate and insert a digital signature into a pdf. To me, this is much more professional than a wiggly line drawn with a mouse which looks like a five-year old&amp;#8217;s attempt at&amp;nbsp;forgery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this can be read fine in the pdf reader in Firefox, but seems to give some problems to Google Chrome and&amp;nbsp;Brave.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of pdf viewers on fedora,  including Zathura, evince (the default) and Sumatra.  I always used Sumatra on Windows, because it&amp;#8217;s so incredibly lightweight, but Okular definitely wins in terms of supporting more formats and offering the capability of annotation and digital signatures. I haven&amp;#8217;t explored all its options, but it seems tightly coupled to the operating system (it uses the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s certificate store, 
you add certs externally, on the command line). Depending on your 
starting point, you may think this is more or less of a good&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/p&gt;

Satire, whether on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; or in print or on the internet is very powerful in shifting the Overton Window/zeitgeist&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/p&gt;

I strongly urge you to follow him &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/coldwarsteve"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.

should be problematic. 
Exactly what &amp;#8216;market share&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;market&amp;#8217; are hard to define. 
They certainly depend on what people regard as substitute goods. 
Some people consider tofu an acceptable substitute for cheese, others not so much.
Most  people probably just think &amp;#8220;if I can get stuff I need for a reasonable cost, why is there a&amp;nbsp;problem.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An economy with lots of atomic entities (individuals) privately contracting with each other 
for the provision of services would be chaotic and not very productive. In practice, most of us work for larger entities (&amp;#8216;firms&amp;#8217;) where we do have an employment contract, but one which is vague in the extreme about exactly what we are expected to deliver for our wages.
The difference is so large that there is a totally different type of taxation of income derived from a &amp;#8216;contract of service&amp;#8217; (i.e. employment) and from a &amp;#8216;contract for service&amp;#8217; (aka &amp;#8216;self-employment&amp;#8217;, e.g. cutting someone&amp;#8217;s hair for a fixed payment). Given that we mostly work for large firms, it doesn&amp;#8217;t seem unnatural that we all get our electronic goods from&amp;nbsp;Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J D Rockerfeller, once the richest person on the planet, was highly religious, and saw it as his mission to get rid of the wasteful competition of hundreds of oil exploration and production companies that were forever undercutting each other swinging from underproduction to massive overproduction, with consequent bankruptcy and destruction of capital. By &amp;#8216;coordinating&amp;#8217; the transport of oil, he stabilized the market and incidentally made quite a bit of cash for himself. What he did was perfectly legal, under the legal code of the time, and it was not until the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Congress passed new laws that monopolistic behaviour like
his became illegal. Even when Standard Oil, his company, was broken up, the extent of real competition was, shall we say,&amp;nbsp;muted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-trust enforcement seems to have operated reasonably effectively until the 1950s and maybe a bit beyond. This was a golden age for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; middle class, maybe not so coincidentally. At some point in the 1970s, 
Robert Bork wrote &lt;em&gt;The Antitrust Paradox&lt;/em&gt;. This argued that stopping firms getting big was hurting consumers, or at least not harming them. 
It&amp;#8217;s hard to argue that we as consumers suffer from runaway price inflation of the sort of items we buy from Amazon, or Tesco, come to that. And when it comes to Google, which gives away most of its products to end consumers, how can it be argued that consumers are harmed?&lt;a href="#they-can"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conventional wisdom is that the production function of firms shows declining returns to scale (or something that sounds like that). The idea is that after a factory, or firm, gets beyond a certain, modest size (dependent on the industry) unit costs start to rise. 
Well, it&amp;#8217;s not obvious that this is a good model of how most modern firms operate.
A lot of sectors, from aircraft manufacturing to distribution of soft drinks have become dominated by a handful of firms.
I think that the combination of improvements in communications technology, and the increasing cost of arms-length contracting between independent legal entities, have resulted in big firms getting big because they really can make things&amp;nbsp;cheaper.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether firms are getting bigger because they have found a way of nullifying the diseconomies of scale or because they acquire pricing power through monopoly (or, more commonly, oligopoly) is slightly beside the point. In both cases some legislative action is needed, either to break them up, or to limit their return on capital. 
This is an uncontroversial position. Utilities (electricity distribution companies etc.) have been regulated as monopolies for decades. It&amp;#8217;s time to do this for Google: many people see it as a sort of utility, certainly something they&amp;#8217;d find difficulty in doing&amp;nbsp;without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/on-lina-khan-derangement-syndrome?publication_id=11524&amp;amp;post_id=103122497&amp;amp;isFreemail=true"&gt;The post that got me&amp;nbsp;thinking.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;#8216;antitrust&amp;#8217; derives from the fact that Rockerfeller held shares in many different companies in trust, paying the beneficial owners all their dividends and other distributions that ownership entitled to together with some modest additional incentive &lt;em&gt;but retaining voting rights through which he exercised control of a much larger part of production than would have been possible by simply buying shares in the open market.&lt;/em&gt; Daniel Yergin&amp;#8217;s book &amp;#8216;The Prize&amp;#8217; gives a fascinating account of&amp;nbsp;this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;#8217;m musing on this, I find it very odd that modern finance hasn&amp;#8217;t found a way to separate voting rights from the shares they start off as attached to so they can be traded&amp;nbsp;separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ronald Coase understood that offsetting diseconomies of scale was the scope to economize on contracting costs, when a firm is vertically integrated in all factors of production, especially&amp;nbsp;labour. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Wrap for Jan</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/wrap-for-jan.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-02-03T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-02-03T21:59:09+00:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2023-02-03:/wrap-for-jan.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;2023-02-03&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;+6.3%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANG&lt;/span&gt; +18.7% (in spite of crap&amp;nbsp;earnings),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;STOXX&lt;/span&gt; 60&amp;nbsp;+6.8%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USTs&amp;nbsp;+2.8%,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other sovereign bonds (e.g. gilts&amp;nbsp;+2.8%),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Industrial metals (Cu&amp;nbsp;+10.9%),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; everything (equities, bonds and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt;),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crypto (not a real asset, but &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BTC&lt;/span&gt; up 38.8%&amp;nbsp;nevertheless).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these changes were given a tailwind by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; (dollar index)
being down again, by 1.4%, back to&amp;nbsp;~102.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it&amp;#8217;s not all good. Energy has had a dismal start, 
in spite of being priced in dollars. Natty (natural gas) was murdered (down 40% near-month futures), and oil (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTI&lt;/span&gt; futures, near-month) was down 1.7%. Note that oil is still in a stiff backwardation, indicating continued supply shortages. However, I find it hard to believe
that eight years out oil will still be trading at around $50 &lt;em&gt;in 2031&amp;nbsp;dollars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that&amp;#8217;s it from me. I will be away for a couple of weeks, 
so updates will be sporadic and probably holiday themed.

&lt;h2&gt;Inflation as a&amp;nbsp;tax&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Hunt is saying that he can&amp;#8217;t pay nurses any more money
because doing so will cause inflation to go up and
that inflation is a tax (with an implication that it&amp;#8217;s an unalloyed Bad&amp;nbsp;Thing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, in my humble opinion, there is …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;2023-02-02&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inflation as a&amp;nbsp;tax&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Hunt is saying that he can&amp;#8217;t pay nurses any more money
because doing so will cause inflation to go up and
that inflation is a tax (with an implication that it&amp;#8217;s an unalloyed Bad&amp;nbsp;Thing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, in my humble opinion, there is a lot that&amp;#8217;s wrong with this logic.
The price of goods going up makes us poorer, for sure. But the price of labour going up makes us richer. There is often a lag, but historically
wages have gone up faster than retail prices, even in periods of high&amp;nbsp;inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other problem is that paying nurses more doesn&amp;#8217;t actually change inflation at all. We don&amp;#8217;t pay anything (directly) to go to hospital, 
so doubling nurses&amp;#8217; wages would not technically increase inflation.
I accept that there would be secondary effects on the labour market, but there would not be a first order&amp;nbsp;effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general idea that we&amp;#8217;re made worse off by increasing public services is, also, clearly wrong. The large majority of the population pay less in taxes than they consume in public services. I would guess that only the top couple of deciles of earners actually put more into the system than they take out in the form of schools, hospitals, defence, roads, justice, policing, social care, foreign aid&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#8217;s the point. Inflation does redistribute wealth, from creditors to debtors, at least when debts are fixed in nominal terms. When we borrow £100 to buy an asset which is worth £100 now, in a year&amp;#8217;s time we will have benefited to the tune of the inflation in the price of the asset (less any debt service costs). Interest costs rise to offset inflation, but this leads to increased income tax paid by lenders, 
and reduced costs borne by&amp;nbsp;borrowers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  low and falling interest rates which we have seen from the 1980&amp;#8217;s
have resulted in a massive financialization of western economies.
I&amp;#8217;ve written about this regularly, but the best account in my view is &lt;em&gt;The Great Deformation&lt;/em&gt; by David Stockman. If we get some spiking real interest rates, we might see some reversal of&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course in the technical sense that inflation is like a tax because it reduces the (real) size of the public sector debt burden, this is quite correct. Inflation does indeed allow governments to spend without levying any actual increased taxes on the public. But I really don&amp;#8217;t think that was what Hunt had in&amp;nbsp;mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Refs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inflation is a stealth tax &amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;p&gt;76% think wealthy individuals often use their influence on Government for their own interests.&lt;a href="https://www.transparency.org.uk/corruption-statistics#_edn3"&gt;[iii]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just &lt;strong&gt;52 people&lt;/strong&gt; made a sixth of all declared &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; political donations between 2001 and 2016.&lt;a href="https://www.transparency.org.uk/corruption-statistics#_edn4"&gt;[iv]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;£1.27 billion&lt;/strong&gt; is lost annually to fraud, bribery and corruption in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;a href="https://www.transparency.org.uk/corruption-statistics#_edn5"&gt;[v]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to view corruption as a problem that can be solved using the tools of economics. Policy makers, civil servants and firms which supply goods and services to the public sector are all subject to laws of supply and demand.
A civil servant can maximize his utility by accepting bribes to boost his salary in exchange for recommending a supplier who is, perhaps, slightly less competitive than one which 
chooses not to pay a&amp;nbsp;bribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rational economist in me wants to dismiss sociological and cultural explanations of increased corruption, but maybe that&amp;#8217;s just &amp;#8230; irrational.
We have become a more fragmented society, as religion has been replaced by 
social media and Netflix. 
We live in  increasingly income-segregated communities. 
Leafy suburbs become unaffordable for public sector workers, as the catchment areas of 
outstanding schools shrink and the house prices in them escalate beyond reach.
Private schools, once affordable to bank managers and local solicitors become the 
preserve of rich Chinese&amp;nbsp;parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer have a shared experience of consumption of news.
The popular press and media now are everywhere, the free, ad-supported low-brow material is driving out the higher quality material
which has to be behind a paywall in order to pay the journalists who 
produce it. Every fortnight &lt;em&gt;Private Eye&lt;/em&gt; runs story after story of petty 
corruption in Westminster, the City and local authorities around the
country, but only boring old farts like me who are willing to
pay to read it are exposed to its scoops.
The masses consume endless non-stories about Kim Kardashian, Katie Price and 
assorted other vacuous celebrities. Cynics will say that it was ever thus, but even in households which took the Daily Mirror and the News of the World the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s serious news programmes on Radio 4 were listened&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;

To be honest, the summary is more understandable than the original book,
although maybe if I&amp;#8217;d read them in a different order I wouldn&amp;#8217;t be saying&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoffer was an interesting character. You can read more about him &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Hoffer"&gt;in Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;. 
He lived in interesting times, being born in 1902, and worked in interesting places (a dockyard, rather than a university), so has a different perspective to people around&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He tries to formulate a theory of the origin and growth of mass movements (such as Nazism). He identifies the sorts of individuals who are attracted to mass movements, which 
he says are rather like those who are attracted to religious cults.
He puts great store in the idea that people join cults because they want to lose
their individual&amp;nbsp;identity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says that for a mass movement to get established, and last a long time, 
it must have a series of leaders with different distinctive abilities, for example, Lenin, the intellectual (&amp;#8216;man of words&amp;#8217;) got the Bolshevik revolution going, but it took a &amp;#8216;man of action&amp;#8217; (Stalin) to allow it to develop into something&amp;nbsp;durable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I liked the book better than &lt;em&gt;The Origins of Totalitarianism&lt;/em&gt; by Hannah Arendt.
Arendt&amp;#8217;s book spends too much time talking about why people dislike Jews to have
any claim to be a unifying&amp;nbsp;theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One insight which Hoffer has is that people join revolutionary movements when they feel a sense of loss. He makes the familiar point that the desperately poor are too busy trying to 
find their next meal to get tangled up in a revolution, but that middle class people who have
lost something they (or their parents) enjoyed can be easily persuaded by a demagogue.
The current strikes by public sector workers, many of whom have seen their living standards
decline materially as inflation erodes their ability to buy the small luxuries they used to enjoy
will form the vanguard of a more populous movement who will rise up against student loans,
high taxes, terrible public services and increasing wealth inequality. Probably&amp;nbsp;not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is the interest on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; public sector debt&amp;nbsp;sustainable?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; up against almost everything, except &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AUD&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Equities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities were up on the week, with the exception of a few defensive sectors,
especially healthcare.
The standout performance was $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;, up 33% on the week, but after a long
downtrend.
Semiconductors were up, except $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;INTC&lt;/span&gt;, which everyone seems to have
lost faith&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; generally was up, except $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACN&lt;/span&gt; (Accenture, which I don&amp;#8217;t even think
belongs in the sector) and $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IBM&lt;/span&gt; (which nobody has liked for a couple
of&amp;nbsp;decades). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy stocks were not very lively, even $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CVX&lt;/span&gt; showed a small loss on the week,
in spite of good&amp;nbsp;results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bond and Fixed&amp;nbsp;Interest&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields were up across the board, almost, reversing recent performance.
Supposedly, this means that the chances of recession(s) are decreasing, 
which is consistent with equity results, but I feel this may be a false
dawn.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; was an outlier, with yields down, in the slightly odd club of developed
countries, which include Romania and Poland in Europe and a few more
outside of Europe, including Zambia, whose yield has come down by 34bp,
but only to 30.2%. Let&amp;#8217;s hope that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; gilt yields are not heading to 
those elevated&amp;nbsp;heights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Markets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the dollar continues to sag.
Apart from a few basket-case countries (such as Pakistan),
the milkshake has curdled badly.
This is all of a piece with equities and bonds: the 
narrative is that the Fed will start to &amp;#8216;normalize.&amp;#8217;
The curve is still inverted, and increasingly so, both 2/10s and 
over the first two years of the eurodollar&amp;nbsp;markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Commodities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, equity and precious metal commodities had a soggy week,
in spite of the weakening dollar. Energy wobbled around $80/bbl (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTI&lt;/span&gt; futures),
really not much higher than it was towards the end of 2018.
The pundits keep predicting that the &amp;#8216;reflation&amp;#8217;/&amp;#8217;reopening&amp;#8217; trade will turbocharge
oil, but if markets are forward looking, and discount all available information, 
then something is amiss. Maybe the fabled &amp;#8216;soft landing&amp;#8217; will turn out to be&amp;nbsp;bone-crushing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something is amiss with the price of &amp;#8216;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EV&lt;/span&gt; minerals too.&amp;#8217; As &lt;a href="https://bfrandall.substack.com/p/another-mining-truth-bomb-from-john?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;amp;publication_id=1140581&amp;amp;post_id=98274231&amp;amp;isFreemail=true&amp;amp;utm_medium=email"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; points out,
the quantity of ore, and overburden, required to be dug to make a modern &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EV&lt;/span&gt; is extraordinary.
The pro-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EV&lt;/span&gt; crowd always argue that &amp;#8216;over time technologies get better and more efficient.&amp;#8217;
Well, this is true, but in a century and a half of oil extraction, the cost of a barrel hasn&amp;#8217;t dropped dramatically. 
It&amp;#8217;s one thing for microprocessors to get better, it&amp;#8217;s quite another for physical commodities
to suddenly fall in price. 
No technological breakthrough is going to revolutionize the extraction of cobalt, nickel, graphite, lithium and copper. It&amp;#8217;s going to be a long, hard grind (in a giant ball&amp;nbsp;mill).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to get away from whether this mining is a good thing or a bad thing. 
I want to know if it&amp;#8217;s going to happen or not. 
At the moment it looks like a standoff between the irresistible force of political consensus
against the immovable object of unaffordable economics. I am a betting man, but I don&amp;#8217;t think I have any edge in forecasting the winner of this epic struggle.
The economist in me wants to predict that the hopes of a green revolution will be
dashed on the rocks of bad economics, but governments increasingly specialize in 
passing laws which make us poorer. It&amp;#8217;s not clear that this case will be any&amp;nbsp;different.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Grr, Artificial Intelligence let me down again</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/grr-artificial-intelligence-let-me-down-again.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-01-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-01-31T10:39:21+00:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2023-01-26:/grr-artificial-intelligence-let-me-down-again.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;2023-01-26&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Automation is coming for your (professional) job&amp;nbsp;next&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Automation is coming for your (professional) job&amp;nbsp;next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grew up in the 1970s.
The zeitgeist then was the battle between skilled manual labour and capital.
The miners, the steelworkers, the power workers, the railway workers, the 
guys who worked in car factories were all in a life-or-death struggle with 
the managers, who tried to represent the providers of capital to the businesses
(or, when these industries were nationalized, the government, especially the Conservative governments of Ted Heath and Margaret&amp;nbsp;Thatcher).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The position of both sides was reasonable. The workers wanted to maintain their incomes in real terms (inflation was raging), the capitalists didn&amp;#8217;t want to see their investment go to zero, and the government wanted to avoid the endless tax increases that would have been required to maintain pay&amp;nbsp;levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The villain of the piece wasn&amp;#8217;t the evil intent of the participants. It was the forces of globalization and technical progress. 
Oil had a greater energy density than coal, was easier to transport and was much, much cheaper to get out of the ground. Labour in what was probably still called &amp;#8220;The Third World&amp;#8221; then was delighted to exchange subsistence farming for factory work at a fraction of the cost of a British Leyland production line worker. 
Some industries (like coal) had been in decline for half a century or more, but the rapid growth of the overall economy since &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WWII&lt;/span&gt; had meant that there was always a strong demand for the sorts of skills that miners brought to the job&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media presented a diversity of views, but generally was unsympathetic to the plight of 
the redundant factory worker or unemployed bricklayer.
The feeling was, I think, that they simply needed to learn a new skill, maybe as an insurance salesman, to return to the workforce. The print and broadcast journalist was in demand and well&amp;nbsp;paid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things are not so rosy now for the reporter, or for the accountant.
It seems quite likely that technologies like Chat &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; will be able to churn out pretty good copy on any topic under the sun within a fraction of a career lifetime. 
Soon after, the physician and the lawyer might face the prospect of their jobs
being taken by a sentient and plausible &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;bot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder what the reaction will be. It seems likely that there will be a fight every bit as 
fierce as that waged by Arthur Scargill against this sort of technology, although it&amp;#8217;s hard 
to imagine journalists showing the same sort of solidarity that the miners did (even though that was far from 100%). 
In a perfect world, we&amp;#8217;d all work a shorter and shorter working week.
In the real world, it always works out that a bigger proportion of the population is 
forced to become economically inactive.
Going on the dole is not a pleasant prospect.
I&amp;#8217;m sure some geeks are going to jeer and say &amp;#8220;learn to code.&amp;#8221;
The problem is that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt; is already starting to automate program writing.
There is no hope for any of&amp;nbsp;us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that cheerful note, I&amp;#8217;ll sign off. I was hoping to get Chat &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPT&lt;/span&gt; to write today&amp;#8217;s
post, but the servers are overwhelmed with demand.
I hope this not a sign of things to&amp;nbsp;come.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Commodities Update</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/commodities-update.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-01-24T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-01-25T16:00:20+00:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2023-01-24:/commodities-update.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;2023-01-24&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Commodities&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m late with &amp;#8216;a year in review&amp;#8217; post, but I think it&amp;#8217;s worth looking back a year
from now, to see what&amp;#8217;s happening in commodities&amp;nbsp;markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The&amp;nbsp;winners&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Coal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m late with &amp;#8216;a year in review&amp;#8217; post, but I think it&amp;#8217;s worth looking back a year
from now, to see what&amp;#8217;s happening in commodities&amp;nbsp;markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The&amp;nbsp;winners&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Coal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dirtiest, most carbon intense source of energy has had a stonking year!
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; coal is up 60% YoY.
I guess it&amp;#8217;s all those mothballed coal-fired power stations that had to be started up
because, well, Ukraine and stuff. Heating Oil (30% YoY) has done pretty well&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lithium&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lightest metal has had a great year. Up 30%.
The story is pretty clear: EVs are here to stay.
My best guess its that it has further to go. 
Cobalt, also used in battery manufacture, crashed in price.
Be careful trading this stuff!
Molybdenum was up 64%, but it&amp;#8217;s classified as an &amp;#8216;industrial commodity&amp;#8217;, 
so not a &amp;#8216;metal&amp;#8217;, even though it clearly is. A quick bit of research 
suggests that it&amp;#8217;s used a lot for high-performance steel, of the 
sort used to make tanks and missiles. This might have something to do
with the spike in price. It&amp;#8217;s also used to make the catalysts used 
in oil refining.
Uranium eked out a gain of 8.5%. Lots of pundits have great hopes for it, but 
so far it&amp;#8217;s vey meh, in terms of&amp;nbsp;performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Potatoes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yup, the humble spud is a clear winner in the agricultural commodity
space. It&amp;#8217;s up 38%, well ahead of the runner up, orange juice (31%) and 
the bronze medallist, rice (up 22%). 
I guess the carbs have it.
Eggs in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; have gone up in price by 220% YoY.
I suspect that avian flu is to&amp;nbsp;blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Nuclear&amp;nbsp;Power&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, power from nukes is not traded as a commodity, 
but it&amp;#8217;s interesting that the cost of electrical energy in France went up
by 30%, whereas in the rest of Europe (including the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;) went&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The&amp;nbsp;losers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have:
- &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TTF&lt;/span&gt; (Dutch) gas: down 38%,
- Hot Rolled Coil Steel: down 51%,
- Lumber, down 56%,
- Magnesium, down 49% (but urea is down 40%, which is interesting),
- Lean hogs: down&amp;nbsp;20%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Predicting commodity movements, even over quite long time frames, is difficult.
I heard &amp;#8216;experts&amp;#8217; predicting huge gains for oil, urea and cobalt as well as natural gas,
but all these things have failed to perform.
The elephant in the commodities space, crude oil, caught everyone out:
it was down a modest 5.6% over the year. I don&amp;#8217;t think I heard a single pundit predict&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other issue is that some commodities are more volatile than others.
It would have been better to compare &amp;#8216;Z scores&amp;#8217; (moves scaled by historical standard deviation), but the site I got these from
doesn&amp;#8217;t do this for me, and I couldn&amp;#8217;t be bothered to get the
volatility and do it for myself, with the result that the winners
and losers are probably just the commodities with the most 
volatile prices. It&amp;#8217;s the same with countries &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;: South Sudan 
either comes top or bottom in the league of percentage change
in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Source&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Milton Friedman used to say &amp;#8220;No good was ever done by spending other people&amp;#8217;s money.&amp;#8221;
Most people don&amp;#8217;t agree with him, at least when it comes to charity giving: we hand over
our money to Oxfam or Amnesty International hoping that they&amp;#8217;ll spend it&amp;nbsp;wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, we&amp;#8217;re not entirely convinced that we&amp;#8217;re doing the right thing,
so we give money to lots of different charities, hoping that at least one of them
will spend wisely and that their spending will make an impact on something we care about.
It&amp;#8217;s very unlikely that anyone will tell us when that doesn&amp;#8217;t happen. (Maybe if we gave money to Kid&amp;#8217;s Company, we&amp;#8217;d have found out from the press,&amp;nbsp;eventually.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving money away always carries a deadweight cost. We don&amp;#8217;t really know whether or not
the recipient would have preferred the money be spent on something else.
&lt;a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/"&gt;GiveDirectly&lt;/a&gt; attempts to correct this fault, but I suspect that most of the 
desperately poor people who receive the money would prefer it be spent
on getting rid of the kleptocrats who run the countries they live in. Sadly, 
there is no charity that I am aware of whose mission is to assassinate autocrats, 
even though that would make more of a difference than bed nets,&amp;nbsp;probably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to give money to causes we are emotionally attached to. 
A lot of money goes to cancer research charities. 
That&amp;#8217;s lovely, but the net benefits are, I suspect, rather marginal.
Cancer deaths are ever-rising, as a proportion of the whole, 
because treatment is very difficult, or extremely expensive, or both.
We would, almost certainly, be better off spending money on research into 
leprosy, or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TB&lt;/span&gt;. We don&amp;#8217;t because we don&amp;#8217;t know anyone who has died of these&amp;nbsp;diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is almost nothing more humiliating than to be the recipient of charity.
To accept charity is to become a supplicant, to acknowledge the fact that in 
some way one is inferior to the giver.
Believe me, being poor doesn&amp;#8217;t mean that one loses one&amp;#8217;s desire for&amp;nbsp;independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these negative attributes of charity would surely be recognized by lawmakers,
and would result in tax laws and other regulations designed to discourage the creation of charitable enterprises. Surely, you jest! 
In fact, charities are showered with extravagant tax breaks, from freedom from taxes on income and capital gains, to 100% tax breaks for donors. 
Unsurprisingly, charities have sprung up like mushrooms after rain: 168 thousand in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;
currently. Also unsurprisingly, because charity work is looked on as an unalloyed good, those with reputations to launder are attracted to it like iron filings to a neodymium magnet.
People like Jimmy Savile, Jeffrey Epstein, Giselle Maxwell and Sam Bankman-Fried all 
played up their links to charities to burnish their&amp;nbsp;reputations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that many people sincerely and generously donate their time and money to good causes, and in many cases a great deal of good is done.
I simply want to draw attention to the fact that just because something is done in the name 
of charity that it is automatically better than something done in the name of business or
(taxpayer-funded) public service.
The &amp;#8216;third sector&amp;#8217; isn&amp;#8217;t a magic bullet that can fix what&amp;#8217;s wrong with the public sector and the private&amp;nbsp;sector.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>China is opening up</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/china-is-opening-up.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-01-22T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-01-24T20:08:56+00:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2023-01-22:/china-is-opening-up.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;China is back,&amp;nbsp;baby&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China has been hurt by Covid.
The response of the national government has been a catastrophe, 
and the capabilities of the healthcare sector in China have been shown to 
be extremely feeble, both the capability of developing vaccines, and the 
ability of the country to deliver healthcare to its citizens.
Dictators are usually much more concerned about spending money
to maximize the tax rake than on making life longer or more tolerant for its&amp;nbsp;citizens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the fact that Xi Jinping and his fellow kleptocrats are much 
less good at providing public services than they&amp;#8217;d like to pretend does not mean that China cannot return to its prior dominant role in some roles in the global economy. 
Countries will want to reshore some manufacturing, but two decades of
determined offshoring will not be reversed in a week. 
For the next decade, iPhones will be largely manufactured in China. 
There is no economic way for the production process to be 
untangled&amp;nbsp;quicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the longer term, China will decline. The artificial boost from joining
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTO&lt;/span&gt; with &amp;#8216;most favoured nation&amp;#8217; status has lead to an astonishing 
transformation of the country. 
The idea that a deeper integration of China&amp;#8217;s economy with the rest of the world
would result in improved human rights has been proved to be entirely 
without foundation. For sure, it was an expensive way to find out,
but we can&amp;#8217;t unlearn that lesson, however much politicians pretend 
that it was nothing to do with them (I&amp;#8217;m looking at you, Bill Clinton).
Over time, capital will leak out of the country. The elites will find ways 
of smuggling it out. Their kids all attend &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Ivy League colleges already.
It won&amp;#8217;t take them long to work something out.
As Xi gets old and frail, his lieutenants will get bolder and grab more of the pie
for themselves and their children, and their mistresses children.
More saving will leak out of productive investment and into Swiss bank accounts.
We&amp;#8217;ve seen this story goes so many times&amp;nbsp;before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is, what has all this got to do with the price of fish? Or securities?
Things that China consumes will get more expensive. This includes commodities, especially energy, but also minerals like copper and lithium, cobalt and nickel, rare earths and uranium. Even food commodities will see demand rising, as 
the Chinese start to eat more and better. Brazil and Chile and Australia
will surely benefit, maybe Canada and Mexico too. 
Makers of machine tools will benefit, as well as sellers of expensive cars.
A double win for&amp;nbsp;Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe a restarting China will be good for inflation. Plastic toys will get cheaper, 
surely, even if oil gets pricier. Interest rates, real ones, will surely fall.
Probably the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNH&lt;/span&gt;) currency will strengthen: that&amp;#8217;s hard to trade, 
but a proxy might be the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AUD&lt;/span&gt;. China&amp;#8217;s money and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt; markets are heavily 
rigged, so this is a very tentative prediction. China needs its currency 
to be cheap, to keep its factories&amp;nbsp;humming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel very sorry about China, and about the millions of hard-working, honest
Chinese who feel they have no alternative to emigrate and make another life elsewhere. They are a pragmatic lot. Even if I were a lot longer, I&amp;#8217;d look to my own
good and that of my families over trying to foment revolution, 
no matter how much more utility might be created by the&amp;nbsp;attempt.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Pessimism is pathological?</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/pessimism-is-pathological.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-01-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-01-24T20:08:56+00:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2023-01-21:/pessimism-is-pathological.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Optimism is&amp;nbsp;us&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Blair (better known as George Orwell) said &amp;#8220;Any life, when viewed from the inside, is simply a series of defeats.&amp;#8221; 
An old friend of mine, somewhat given to pessimism, always used to 
argue that only people who were clinically depressed had a realistic
view of the world around them. 
Ten percent of all adults in developed nations are  prescribed&amp;nbsp;anti-depressants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us are not going to grow up to be Nobel Prize winners.
We may get a few gold stars as kids, but these hardly prepare us
for the realities of life.  However good we are, we end up in the company
of people who are at least as good as us, something which is harder to bear
the more talented one is. At least the school duffer has his delusions of 
competent rudely shattered at a stage when his self-image has not&amp;nbsp;ossified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genes have a lot to do  with unhappiness. 
They are, famously, selfish. They drive us in various ways, but for their 
benefit, not ours. Heartache invariably results from following our&amp;nbsp;instincts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a practical point of view, we need to be optimistic. Our ancestors had to believe that if they went out hunting they would come back with something worth 
eating. Even if hunts had failed for a fortnight, how could they do otherwise if 
their survival depended on it. Probably, the huge problems we have
with a correct intuition about conditional probabilities is a result of the survival 
of our ancestors depending on our not understanding them. When we bet, we want to guess the winner and bet the farm on our guess. It took until the 1950s, 
when Kelly derived his famous criterion, that we understood, properly, 
why that&amp;#8217;s a bad&amp;nbsp;idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politicians are duty bound to be optimistic. Nobody gets elected by saying that
some new policy has only a 55% probability of making people better off.
To sell it, the politician has to convince voters that it will be a sure-fire success.
To convince voters, politicians first have to convince themselves: Corbyn&amp;#8217;s 
failure was the failure of a man who had campaigned all his life against 
membership of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; but was elected to lead a Labour Party that 
had to support remaining in it at the 2016 Referendum. 
I don&amp;#8217;t even think that people like Boris have to lie about their support for these policies. They just have a facility to not understand the arguments against a policy
when success in their career depends on doing&amp;nbsp;so.&lt;/p&gt;

I try to avoid listening to what politicians have to say.
They occasionally have ghost-written pieces in the paper, but these

Active politicians are always so achingly careful to avoid saying
anything that can be used in evidence against them.

Starmer come over as&amp;nbsp;automatons.&lt;/p&gt;

Yes, that Davos. Google &amp;#8220;Rutget Bregman, Davos&amp;#8221; and understand
why some people are invited back time and time again, and others not so much.
Anyway, Keir was being chaperoned at Davos by Tony Blair and his retinue.
Yes, the Tony Blair who handed the Tories thirteen years in power.
Maitlis and Sopel described how a series of supplicants were ferried 
to meet Starmer, the king in waiting.
&amp;#8220;Business leaders,&amp;#8221; members of the Davos set, given privileged access to 
the leader of the party supposedly representing the interests of labour,
in opposition to&amp;nbsp;capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starmer waffled on about how every problem in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; would be solved
by investing more money in Green Energy.&lt;br&gt;
He emphasized how he wanted Labour to be &amp;#8216;business friendly&amp;#8217; (or &amp;#8216;free market hostile&amp;#8217; as 
I mentally translate that expression).
He was asked about Brexit, and replied, mechanically, how reversing it would be a huge 
mistake as would adopting a Norwegian or Swiss model would be a mistake (while saying how incredibly customized and dynamic these were). 
He spoke about how improving trade with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; was hugely important, but how
adopting &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; standards would not, even though their standards were high, and that 
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; needed high&amp;nbsp;standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He talked about how because the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; has a &amp;#8216;skills problem&amp;#8217; we will have to allow more 
immigration to boost our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; but that we need to solve this problem ourselves, which will (presumably) allow us to not allow immigration. 
Given that the shortages seem to be in jobs that Brits won&amp;#8217;t do, because the work
is hard and the wages are modest (care work, for example), this seemed&amp;nbsp;unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think that Starmer&amp;#8217;s answers were particularly bad. Given the constraints of
his role, they were as good as I could have expected. 
I don&amp;#8217;t think it&amp;#8217;s realistic to think that he could have refused to be interviewed,
but the answers reminded me of a passionate speech by Tony Blair I once listened to.
Blair was telling the audience, and the world, how serious the &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;Y2K&lt;/span&gt; problem&amp;#8221; was, 
and how the consequences would be catastrophic for companies that failed
to invest in purging the bug from their systems.
As someone who had spend a decade or more writing systems that I absolutely knew
would be totally unaffected by the change in the first two digits of the year number, 
I realized that Blair was simply saying something he had been told to say, 
that he really didn&amp;#8217;t understand what he was talking about, but
that it was necessary for him to say these&amp;nbsp;things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is fair enough. Nobody can be an expert on everything.
But by pretending that they have all the answers, senior establishment
politicians make life a lot easier for demagogues like Trump and Farage
(probably Johnson,&amp;nbsp;too). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;

He manages to make complicated ideas in finance funny and easy to understand.
Well, easier to understand than Brearley and&amp;nbsp;Myers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his latest piece he describes that how a company that does nothing but 
take a cashflow and create value just by splitting it into a number of income streams,
&lt;em&gt;without making any changes to the aggregate distributable cashflow.&lt;/em&gt; 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, you probably know about securitization and how it lead to the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, and maybe even about the Modigliani-Miller theorem (which basically says that doing this should be impossible). But the way he explains how the magical value creation can
happen is masterful. (It&amp;#8217;s about regulators making rules about risk weighting of assets which are arbitrary and do not look through to the underlying riskiness of the&amp;nbsp;assets.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The weird shape of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury&amp;nbsp;curve&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Wow" src="https://thedailyshot.com/wp-content/uploads/US-10-curve2301190539.png"&gt;
This curve is not quite a predictor of future short-term rates.
The zero-coupon curve isn&amp;#8217;t either, although it is if you assume a no-arbitrage condition.
The really steep inversion between 6 months and 10 years is remarkable:
140bp.
I don&amp;#8217;t know if we&amp;#8217;ve ever seen such a steep drop.
The market is betting the farm on the Fed doing a handbrake turn in a year from now.
The market knows a lot, but the Fed has a lot of firepower, and a lot of&amp;nbsp;ego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Berkshire&amp;nbsp;Hathaway&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to write something about stocks on a Thursday.
We seem so close to the point where the Fed starts to 
acknowledge that it&amp;#8217;s going to reverse course, and so far along 
in terms of damage to the equity markets that it might just be time
to think about going long&amp;nbsp;something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; equities always seem so darn expensive, especially the &amp;#8216;growth&amp;#8217; 
stocks, but I&amp;#8217;ve always had a soft spot for Berkshire Hathaway.
It seems to me that Warren and Charlie can&amp;#8217;t live forever, and 
when they die, or hang up their slide rules, the stock is going to rocket.
The successor managers will not be able to resist the temptation 
to enrich themselves by splitting up and spinning of what has 
become a rambling incoherent (but very profitable)&amp;nbsp;conglomerate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really wish no harm to come to those good ole boys, but perhaps they should take up
golf and leave the management of Berkshire to the young&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8216;uns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep a sort of scrapbook of equity titbits  &lt;a href="https://github.com/stevehemingway/trading/wiki"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; 
This is the simplest possible thing: just a collection of markdown documents.
It started out just as a way for me to collate stuff I read about individual stocks.
I like to follow stocks, because their varying fortunes give some sort of window
onto the state of the economy in the real world, but they are so complicated
from a valuation point of view that I am very reluctant to invest in individual names.

capacity utilization (down). Bonds rallied, but particularly at the five-year maturity.
Rather than the curve steepening across the full range of maturities, it did up to five years, and then reversed into an inversion further out.
Nobody seems to believe that the Fed will not capitulate, and nobody believes that this will cause problems with persistent inflation in the longer term.
A 10Y-2Y steepener trade did not do well&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heavily shorted names, which have been propelled upwards over the last week or so slumped back today.
Equity markets paused but are up a lot on the week, suggesting that 
the markets do not think that we&amp;#8217;re heading into a deep&amp;nbsp;recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Apple&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; does some very high quality reporting. 
&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d5a80891-b27d-4110-90c9-561b7836f11b"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is one such piece.
It explains how Tim Cook, Apple&amp;#8217;s supply chain boss, subsequently &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt;, 
has embedded nearly all of Apple&amp;#8217;s production knowhow and equipment 
in China, a deeply authoritarian autocratic and genocidal&amp;nbsp;country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I refuse to own any Apple products. The company behaves with craven cowardice towards the Xi Jinping regime, for example &lt;a href="https://theoutline.com/post/8102/tim-cook-hong-kong-hypocrisy"&gt;removing software from its app store that might help democracy protestors in Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;.  (As well as removing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt; apps that would help iPhone users tunnel through the Great Firewall of&amp;nbsp;China.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t believe in corporate karma, but I&amp;#8217;d like Apple&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;hubris&lt;/em&gt; to be met with a suitable &lt;em&gt;nemesis&lt;/em&gt;. Currently Apple has YoY earnings growth of 0.8%, a price-to-book ratio of 42, and a forward P/E of 22. It&amp;#8217;s true that it has huge operating margins (&amp;gt;30%), but just ask Tesla investors whether margins can hold up 
in the face of stiffening&amp;nbsp;competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My understanding is that Apple makes use of a lot of open source code, but gives almost nothing back to the community. I may be wrong about this, and it&amp;#8217;s 
quite a while ago that I read an article alleging this.
Certainly, recent reports suggest that Apple is embracing the Open Source movement (e.g. &lt;a href="https://itsfoss.com/apples-mac-os-open-source/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;) so this part of my argument may have been overtaken by a change of policy at Apple, or even may never have been&amp;nbsp;accurate.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Meritocracy</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/meritocracy.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-01-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-01-16T12:37:09+00:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2023-01-14:/meritocracy.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Should we be ruled by the brightest and the&amp;nbsp;best?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our masters are those who managed to climb the greasy pole the fastest.
Their reward is their dominion over us.
Life&amp;#8217;s also-rans may not be happy about this state of affairs,
but probably console themselves with the idea that 
at least decisions are being taken on our behalfs by 
people who have some sort of extraordinary skill and&amp;nbsp;ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the education system is much more efficient at identifying
talent and promoting it.
Although Etonians are over-represented at Oxford and Cambridge, 
a lot of very bright scholarship boys and girls get in too.
Marxists bemoan this state of affairs, because it depletes
the proletariat of future leaders of the revolution.
But, leaving that aside, and given that the vast bulk of MPs are 
educated to university level, we can take comfort that we we no longer 
have ministers in government who left education at the age of eleven, 
like Ernest&amp;nbsp;Bevin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, is this really a benefit? Real median wages in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; (and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;) have 
stalled over the last forty years. 
We have recessions more frequently than ever.
The recovery of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; from the 2008 Global Financial Crisis was slower than 
in the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
Governments promise to eliminate the (government) deficit and end up 
doubling it. 
The growth in labour productivity (which isn&amp;#8217;t everything, but in the long run is nearly everything) 
has been lower since the elites took charge than since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.
Whichever party is in power, election promises turn to dust.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; per capita drifts further and further behind our major&amp;nbsp;rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political problems are hard to fix. Many of them are about the sharing of pain, 
the allocation of misery.
How much money to allocate to education, or defence, or health, or pensions, 
or poverty relief is not some sort of exercise in multi-variate calculus.
It&amp;#8217;s about deciding on winners and losers.
Packing parliament with a single class &amp;#8212; those who have cleared life&amp;#8217;s 
educational hurdles by the biggest margin &amp;#8212; will lead to a particular 
allocation which, ahem, does not favour those who have drawn the losing 
numbers in the lottery of&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a government is full of very old people, education spending becomes, 
magically, a lower priority than hip replacements.
Having empathy with people who you have never met, and with whom you have nothing in common is almost impossible. 
When those people rarely vote, it&amp;#8217;s harder&amp;nbsp;still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is to be done? Chosing MPs by lot has something to be said for it.
Citizens&amp;#8217; Assemblies have been proposed. 
Maybe some sort of hybrid system could be devised, but expecting MPs
to voter for a system where half of them have to give up their jobs 
to individuals chosen at random seems an unlikely&amp;nbsp;development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil prices have been trending down for half a year.

&lt;p&gt;Oil prices have been trending down for half a year.
Given the number of times that &amp;#8216;high energy prices&amp;#8217; have been used as an
excuse for things getting more expensive, you may be surprised to read this, but it&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;true!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the factors that made oil expensive before are still around.
Russia is still bombing Ukraine.
The world is waking up into a world where covid is endemic.
Even China has given up on the idea that it can be contained.
Oil companies are very reluctant to commit to large-scale capital expenditures 
because, yanno, windfall taxes (which crimps supply).
The world is running out of oilfields which are vaguely 
economic with oil at $70 a barrel.
There are widespread mumblings that the Fed is libering up for a 180 degree&amp;nbsp;pivot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, the charts are not convincing. We have had four false dawns 
since the Autumn. Today may be nothing more&amp;nbsp;serious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="tradingview CL1!" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/h98oAFo6/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Steepeners&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I wrote about the general move towards a more normal shaped
yield curve, which seems never to come.
Going to shorter maturities than Treasuries, I think it&amp;#8217;s worth
looking at Eurodollar futures, which are just forward 3M &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LIBOR&lt;/span&gt; 
futures. 
The near-end steepening view can be expressed by buying a fairly 
near-dated future (e.g. Dec 23) and selling a longer-dated one (e.g. Dec 24) 
as a calendar spread.
This is a faily cheap way of expressing such a view, and, seems quite 
tolerated by Interactive Brokers, in the sense of not requiring much in the way
of additional margin. 
Futures are dangerous things and the last thing I&amp;#8217;d want to do would be to 
advise you to trade them. 
I guess an exception could be made if you really understood how to trade them,
but if you did you&amp;#8217;d be ignoring this sentence and the one before&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising interest rates, driven by central banks trying to fight labour shortages by making capital more&amp;nbsp;expensive,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;central banks promising to double down on their fight against inflation, in spite of the pain being caused by the war in Ukraine and the galvanizing effect it has had on energy&amp;nbsp;prices,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;yield curves generally, but especially in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;, have become even more inverted. This has been relentless since last spring and shows no sign of reversing,&lt;img alt="10Y-2Y spread" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/SPBMllNJ/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;consumer debt levels have completely reversed the drop seen over the lockdown and are now very&amp;nbsp;high,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a lot of firms, especially tech firms, are announcing widespread redundancies. Services are still catching up with the mass layoffs over lockdown, and unemployment is very low, but this is a lagging&amp;nbsp;indicator,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;quit rates are elevated, but coming down: &lt;img alt="fred quit rates" src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=Ypvw"&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M2 is crashing in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; is coming down: &lt;iframe src='https://d3fy651gv2fhd3.cloudfront.net/embed/?s=unitedkinmonsupm2&amp;v=202301071002V20220312&amp;type=type=line&amp;h=300&amp;w=600' height='300' width='600'  frameborder='0' scrolling='no'&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;source: &lt;a href='https://tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/money-supply-m2'&gt;tradingeconomics.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;housing prices are under pressure, initially in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; in the form of a collapse of transaction volumes,&amp;nbsp;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;credit conditions are looking tighter (&lt;a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/credit-conditions-survey/2022/2022-q3"&gt;BoE survey&lt;/a&gt;),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/184a3180-b4bd-4a2d-b3c2-4297d0b5c5fb#post-e30ed69a-c43d-4abc-83bf-e37a4cf5ef4c"&gt;the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMF&lt;/span&gt; is practically forecasting a world recession&lt;/a&gt;,
    &amp;gt; “The risks that we warned of six months ago have materialised and our worst-case scenario is now our baseline scenario,” said Ayhan Kose, the World Bank economist responsible for the report. “The world’s economy is on a razor’s edge and could easily fall into recession if financial conditions&amp;nbsp;tighten.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, a recession is here, or at least just around the corner &lt;em&gt;but equity markets are totally sanguine about this.&lt;/em&gt; 
Is it really all in the price?
Are equity markets so far-sighted and omniscient?
I somehow can&amp;#8217;t believe it, but passive flows into market-cap weighted equities might just keep driving prices higher and we might really end up with a soft landing.
Just like fiat currencies only have a value because people believe in them, equity markets are really quite similar. 
Maybe it&amp;#8217;s the time to go long, but if you do, buy some out-of-the money puts.

&lt;h2&gt;My brush with private&amp;nbsp;equity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;My brush with private&amp;nbsp;equity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very long time ago, I wanted to get funding for a software startup.
This was in the 1980s. I was young and naive, and so was my business partner.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt; was a new thing, and very little software was available for it,
and we had an idea for something that might have created a decent market.
But we didn&amp;#8217;t have any money, nor did we have any rich friends who might
be persuaded to chip in.
Instead, we telephoned 3I, or &amp;#8220;Investors in Industry&amp;#8221; as it was then&amp;nbsp;known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a company, to write software for a device that might have been a fad, 
and getting funding for it was a daring thing.
When we spoke to 3I, the first thing they wanted to see was our order book,
three years of accounts, our cashflow and, well, the stuff that private equity people
want to see today. They were not interested in ideas, or demos of flaky, unfinished&amp;nbsp;software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we really wanted was venture capital, but this didn&amp;#8217;t really exist. 
Well, it did exist, but only really on the west coast of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;.
People like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Rock"&gt;Arthur Rock&lt;/a&gt; were already well established there, but nothing
remotely similar existed here then.
In fact, I&amp;#8217;m not sure venture capital, or the sort invented by Rock, exists now in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;,
in spite of the fact that one of the titans of the industry (sector?), &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Moritz"&gt;Michael Moritz&lt;/a&gt; was born in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venture capital doesn&amp;#8217;t get written about much, even in the financial press, because 
mere mortals like most of us, cannot put money into it. 
It&amp;#8217;s certainly not for the fainthearted: it&amp;#8217;s making concentrated bets on startups
based largely on intuition and gut feel.
We laugh at Masayoshi Son for ploughing a fortune into such obvious Ponzi-schemes
as We Work, but using the same process for choosing who to invest in he hit some
balls out of the&amp;nbsp;park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; is going to have real, home-grown, high-tech entities it needs to have some reckless investors like Son. 
Trying to support high-tech startups with government money is, basically, bound to fail.
No minister could bare to admit that 98% of the companies he&amp;#8217;d put money into had failed.
In fact, if civil servants were making the decision, the percentage would be a lot&amp;nbsp;higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; has some excellent universities, and some very talented software and hardware 
experts working in the country. We also attract a wealth of talent into our top universities from all around the world, but especially developing economies. We should have a much bigger tech industry, but we don&amp;#8217;t because no finance is available.
This is ironic, as finance is such a huge part of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; economy.
Unfortunately, it&amp;#8217;s the wrong kind of finance. 
It&amp;#8217;s the 3I sort of finance, not the Sequoia Capital type of finance.
Although both sorts provide financing away from public markets,
one leads to highly fragile, highly geared, low-wage, cash-cow type companies.
The other leads to companies like Google and&amp;nbsp;Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s often assumed that Rishi Sunak would understand what&amp;#8217;s needed to get investment of this sort. 
I don&amp;#8217;t think this is the case. He worked in California, but for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TCI&lt;/span&gt; Investment Fund Management. Apart from the fact that it&amp;#8217;s believed that he was not involved in
actual investment decisions, this kind of hedge fund invests in public markets, 
and will not be involved with venture&amp;nbsp;capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finance is a complicated ecosystem. Lumping all of it together as &amp;#8216;The City&amp;#8217; is extremely unhelpful, but typical of our lazy&amp;nbsp;press.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Has gold’s time come?</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/has-golds-time-come.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-01-10T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-01-10T20:58:11+00:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2023-01-10:/has-golds-time-come.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;2023-01-10&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The barbarous relic at the&amp;nbsp;gate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All right-thinking economists dismiss gold as money.
Keynes famously declared it a &amp;#8216;barbarous relic&amp;#8217;.
But even after all these years, the yellow rock still gets
investors and journalists excited (e.g. &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c0903d85-f56d-4233-9650-c501ce2bab1a"&gt;in today&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the appeal of gold is its sheer longevity. For something to be a store of value,
you want something with a track record. Gold has served that purpose longer than 
any other substance. Sure, it&amp;#8217;s fairly heavy, but an ounce (28g) is not much of a weight
to carry around for something exchangeable for about $2K.
Systems like the Bancor, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SDR&lt;/span&gt;, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMF&lt;/span&gt;, the convertability of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; dollar
are all footnotes of history (or going that way). Gold remains an important, 
reserve asset for central&amp;nbsp;banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies have been referred to as &amp;#8216;digital gold.&amp;#8217;
Well, that&amp;#8217;s practically &amp;#8216;gold envy,&amp;#8217; and certainly endorses gold&amp;#8217;s status as a store of value.
I may be wrong, but I get the impression that a lot of cryptocurrency are less 
enthusiastic hodlers than they once were, and just maybe considering diversifying into
something more &amp;#8230;&amp;nbsp;analogue!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, one of the main use of bitcoin was to bypass currency controls and sanctions.
The noose is closing on crypto exchanges, with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KYC&lt;/span&gt; regulation becoming more onerous than for a &amp;#8216;real&amp;#8217; bank account. Buying some Krugerrands has never been so appealing &amp;#8230; to a certain class of&amp;nbsp;customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold&amp;#8217;s Achilles Heel is that it pays no interest. With bond yields rising fast, one might imagine that this was a headwind for gold prices, but in fact since Nov. the price action has been very positive.
The fact is that &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; yields are now deeply negative as we experience the secular shift into an environment of deeply embedded inflation, and it&amp;#8217;s real yields that&amp;nbsp;matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Comex Gold, nearby contract" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/LCBQoXSM/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money is generally a very safe liability, typically of a government.
The acceptability of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; as a currency is intimately bound up with the fact that the 
Fed cannot run out of money, putting the credit risk on its promissory notes at zero.
Gold is different. It&amp;#8217;s money that is nobody&amp;#8217;s liability.
It&amp;#8217;s not an entry in any bank&amp;#8217;s ledger. 
The holder of gold will never by subject to arbitrary restrictions on who they may transfer it to, give or take transport&amp;nbsp;costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this mean that the gold price will suddenly go to the moon?
I am no Peter Schiff.  No commodity is a sure-fire thing.
But gold clearly has value, and the basis of that value is increasingly becoming &amp;#8216;common knowledge.&amp;#8217; Market participants know there is safety in numbers, and will stay out of an asset until they can see the herd start to turn.
Then they get with the programme, because they know that if they don&amp;#8217;t they&amp;#8217;ll be trampled under foot.
Are we near that inflection point now? I really have no idea, but I feel that we are nearer to it now than we were a couple of years ago. Crypto has had its day. I don&amp;#8217;t think it&amp;#8217;s coming back. 
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAANGMAN&lt;/span&gt; stocks are no longer the no-brainers they seemed to be.
Energy commodities are on a glide-path down.
Maybe precious metals will finally have their day in the&amp;nbsp;sun.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>The Fed wants you to lose your job</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/the-fed-wants-you-to-lose-your-job.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-01-09T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-01-10T20:58:11+00:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2023-01-09:/the-fed-wants-you-to-lose-your-job.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Bonds&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="10Y-2Y SPREAD" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/Y6w2wfFX/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People imagine that the Left don&amp;#8217;t worry about balancing the budget,
but that the Right do.
This is nonsense, obviously. 
It&amp;#8217;s just that Left and Right have different ideas about what spending 
justifies big deficits.
Everyone thinks that Stephanie Kelton (or Randall Wray or Warren Mosler) invented &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt;, but it&amp;#8217;s actually Dick Cheney who coined the phrase &amp;#8220;Deficits don&amp;#8217;t matter,&amp;#8221; and he is no icon of the&amp;nbsp;Left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Fed worries about it, supposedly because of its mandate, but really because the people who run it want to look good, as I&amp;#8217;ve written before.
The artificial separation of central bank and treasury functions in western 
countries leads to a peculiar fixation on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CB&lt;/span&gt; making a &amp;#8216;profit&amp;#8217; by buying up lots of govt debt in exchange for reserve balances, a trade that is usually 
lucrative &amp;#8212; as long as the yield curve is upward sloping. It&amp;#8217;s only a &amp;#8216;profit&amp;#8217;
because treasuries make a corresponding loss: they might as well just fund themselves overnight, since that&amp;#8217;s usually the cheapest rate, and they
can&amp;#8217;t actually run out of&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, fighting inflation sort of doesn&amp;#8217;t matter, but in the real world does matter, 
and in the real world this means having the central bank engineer a recession, to crash demand.
Central bankers pretend they can manage a soft landing, 
but you know they are lying.
Although some downward pressure on prices can be engineered by 
crashing the housing market (a pretty blunt instrument in itself),
because services, which is really just labour, is such a huge component of the economy, you have to make more people unemployed to 
bring down inflation.
Even though, in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, eight million people do not work enough to not have to depend on means-tested benefits like Universal Credit, still people have to lose their jobs to stop asset prices falling any more, and, for example, 
making houses cheaper to&amp;nbsp;buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economists talk in terms of all borrowers at all maturities pay a single rate of interest. This is a heroic assumption, but jacking up the base rate by 5% will
certainly kill capital spending, which is going to put builders out of work.
Sure, some people will earn more interest income, and will spend some of it, and increase demand, but mostly they are rich people who already have too much stuff and will probably spend it buying an island in the&amp;nbsp;Carribean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The currency will increase in value, which is handy for  buyers of overseas islands, but has the effect of making stuff made overseas cheaper than
stuff made here, shifting production abroad. Oh well, China needs more&amp;nbsp;factories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marx talked about the &amp;#8220;reserve army of labour:&amp;#8221; the need to maintain an excess supply of labour at all times, to make sure that the price of labour 
did not escalate rapidly as the stock of capital (the complementary good) accumulated. Bill Phillips, a lot later, posited that there would be a tradeoff 
between inflation and unemployment, without adding a lot, in my opinion, 
to Marx&amp;#8217;s insights, but I guess &amp;#8220;Phllips Curve&amp;#8221; sounds more&amp;nbsp;patriotic.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Cults, the mean voter theorem and the disaffected</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/cults-the-mean-voter-theorem-and-the-disaffected.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-01-08T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-01-16T12:37:09+00:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2023-01-08:/cults-the-mean-voter-theorem-and-the-disaffected.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am not the first blogger to comment that today&amp;#8217;s politics is broken.

I&amp;#8217;m probably not even in the first few thousand.
We have seen the rise of demagogues like Nigel Farage and Donald Trump and Marine Le Pen, 
something that has both terrified and mystified mainstream politicians
like Keir Starmer and David Cameron and Emmanuel&amp;nbsp;Macron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen this before. The economic chaos of the start of the last century lead to the rise of leaders like Stalin, Hitler and Mussolini. 
I think what this period had in common with our own is the fact that 
a lot of ordinary people became disillusioned about their prospects.
They felt that they could look forward to a life that was not improving, 
and was in material terms worse than that of their&amp;nbsp;parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joining a movement like the Nazis is not like joining the National Trust.
The point of it is to take over your life, like joining the Hari Krisna movement.
Maybe that goes for joining Momentum, or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UKIP&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAGA&lt;/span&gt;.
You might not like what these movements stand for, but they give their 
members a sense of purpose, if only to roll the dice, to shake up the kaleidescope to reveal a new arrangement of society which might, just might, put them in some position other than at the very bottom of the&amp;nbsp;pile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainstream politicians can&amp;#8217;t do this. They have studied politics, and they know that elections are won on the centre ground. 
They know that the Median Voter Theorem says that you maximize your vote share by sailing as close to your opponents policies as humanly possible while carefully being on the side nearer the centre.
This produces mainstream parties which are indistinguishable from each other, but are able to win elections,&amp;nbsp;mostly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several problems with this. Eventually, voters start to understand that if voting for a different party makes no difference to policy, they start to not vote at all, or vote for the fringe.
The second thing is that parties become incapable of attracting hard core support, both for candidates and activists.
The third thing is that parties become easy and cheap for corporate and other sectoral interests (e.g. trade unions) to capture. 
Activists are, by their nature passionate, about fighting oppression, 
preserving civilization, defending individual freedom. 
These people need an outlet. 
In the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, Labour and the Conservatives just don&amp;#8217;t provide&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Is technical analysis the triumph of the efficient market hypothesis?</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/is-technical-analysis-the-triumph-of-the-efficient-market-hypothesis.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-01-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-01-07T22:32:26+00:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2023-01-07:/is-technical-analysis-the-triumph-of-the-efficient-market-hypothesis.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;2023-01-07&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Technical&amp;nbsp;analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technical analysis, the studying of price history charts,
like the Ancient Romans studied the entrails of animals
or palmists study lines on one&amp;#8217;s palm, has an ancient&amp;nbsp;pedigree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like fortune tellers, the best chartists study fundamentals and the
macroeconomic environment as deeply as any market participant.
Classic books on the subject emphasize the primacy of a compelling
economic case for a price move above mere graphical&amp;nbsp;formations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality of trading is that the market doesn&amp;#8217;t know that you&amp;#8217;ve worked out
why a security is mispriced. 
Tesla equity has been mispriced for a very long time, but it would be suicidal to 
short the stock until there was evidence that the bulls had finally capitulated.
Really, the only evidence for this is in the&amp;nbsp;price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, hard facts are important. But when trading in deep and liquid markets,
the marginal seller and buyer are extremely well informed, to the point that 
it&amp;#8217;s hard to prove that trading skill makes a difference.
It&amp;#8217;s like very skillful sports such as soccer. The results of competitions between
the very top teams are almost random, not because the players are not skillful,
but because they are all so highly, and equivalently skilled, that skill counts for little 
in determining the final result. (This is different for basketball, where height is such an
important factor that there is a bigger dispersion in skill levels between players and&amp;nbsp;teams.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with the best regulation, inside information about a company&amp;#8217;s prospects leaks out, 
and is traded on, and makes profits for those insiders. I won&amp;#8217;t comment on the tremendous trading success of members of Congress.
The source and use of this information can be kept secret, but not the actual trading, 
whether of the underlying security, or some derivative of is, or even as some sort of
proxy trade. All this trading does affect the price level, at the margin, and this signal
is transmitted through price charts. Could I recognize a characteristic pattern of
price movement resulting from the use of inside information? No! But can I imagine that a skilled person could learn such a thing. Probably,&amp;nbsp;yes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to summarize, I&amp;#8217;m still not a believer, when it comes to the dark arts of technical analysis,
but I am not an atheist either. Let&amp;#8217;s say that I&amp;#8217;m an interested agnostic, and will take a look
at a chart now and&amp;nbsp;then.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>The milkshake is curdled</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/the-milkshake-is-curdled.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-01-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-01-06T22:24:52+00:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2023-01-06:/the-milkshake-is-curdled.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;2023-01-06&lt;/h1&gt;

but no economist ever got rich by using economic theory to position his 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;exposure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, possibly Keynes actually did. As I understand it, he positioned himself
in anticipation of countries going off the gold standard.
He knew a lot about the pain that a country suffers from fixing its exchange rate to gold,
or to that of a economy which is not closely coupled to the country of issue,
but Keynes was operating a lot time ago, and all tradeable currencies now are freely&amp;nbsp;floating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not that the theories do not have a lot of validity. It&amp;#8217;s just that the market rates
largely reflex the entirety of the observable factors that feed into an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt; rate, for example the 
terms of trade: the relative movements of prices in the two countries (specifically, the import and export prices). For example, if gold trades for $150 an oz. in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; and £100 an oz. in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, and gold can be freely traded between the two countries, it&amp;#8217;s a good guess that
the price of one &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBP&lt;/span&gt; will soon reach $1.50. But the real world is a lot messier than&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent commentary focusses on how the dollar is strong, because the Fed is hiking more aggressively than other central banks, and so commodity prices are being trashed.
Well the following chart shows that this simply hasn&amp;#8217;t been the case since the end of Sept&amp;nbsp;2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="DXY" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/yrg7Ds05/"&gt;
The dollar has been relatively weak, on a trade-weighted basis, 
and yet commodities have not rallied. The dollar is going down.
If I were paid anything to explain this, I&amp;#8217;d attribute it to the Fed&amp;#8217;s tightening cycle being ahead of other central banks, resulting in an expectation that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; rates will peak sooner than Eurozone ones, for example. 
Because I&amp;#8217;m not, I can admit to complete ignorance.
But the chart about does have the look of a trend that is going to continue down for a while.
A country like the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; has powerful corporate lobbyists. 
I&amp;#8217;m pretty certain that they just love the direction in which the dollar is heading, 
and that the Fed is not unaffected by politics, however much it protests that it is&amp;nbsp;not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For what it&amp;#8217;s worth, I rather like the look of South American commodity currencies, 
such as the Mexican Peso or the Brazilian Real. These countries have been burned by severe inflation in recent memory, and have responded quickly to kill it. 
Rates are high, but sustainable, and with commodity prices likely to rise as inflation continues to rage in the West, they must be worth a look. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;INVESTMENT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ADVICE&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Equity focus</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/equity-focus.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-01-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-01-06T10:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2023-01-05:/equity-focus.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;2023-01-05&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, equity prices are dependent on so many factors,
it&amp;#8217;s hard to know what is driving them over any given timescale.
With forex, there are a variety of simple models, such as 
covered interest rate parity, which help one think about why 
a currency should go up and down against another.
With equities, the factors are almost uncountable.
Matt Levine has come up with a theory that the value of a stock
is a function of how connected the company that issued it is 
to Elon Musk (seriously: check &lt;a href="https://marker.medium.com/10-000-years-ago-elon-musk-would-have-been-casting-spells-on-rocks-and-shells-9cfb7ef0a608"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; out!).
So when briefing.com says that the stock market went up (or down)
because non-farm payrolls were a few percent different to 
analysts&amp;#8217; expectations, well, let&amp;#8217;s say I&amp;#8217;m not&amp;nbsp;convinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with equities is that they carry a bundle of rights.
Rights to a dividend stream, but also rights to vote on certain 
decisions a company might take.
This makes an equity fundamentally different to a bond, even though
&amp;#8216;equity&amp;#8217; on a balance sheet is right there, alongside liabilities, 
balancing the assets of that company, and so seems to be very bond-like.
The &amp;#8216;Fed Model&amp;#8217; of equity prices simply compares the earnings yield on 
a stock with the redemption yield on a Treasury bond, and if the gap 
is larger, or smaller than usual, the equity (or really the whole equity market)
is under- or over-valued. This puts the voting rights at zero, which is where
a lot of retail investors would put them.
But when J D Rockerfeller separated the dividend stream from the voting rights
in the &amp;#8216;trusts&amp;#8217; he created, he certainly didn&amp;#8217;t see things that way.
By careful exercise of these voting rights of companies that he did not own (well, did
not received dividends from), he cornered the market in oil transportation,
making himself the Elon Musk of his&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1950s and before, holding equities as an asset against the liabilities of 
pension funds was regarded as dangerously radical.  George Henry Ross Goobey is known as the &amp;#8220;father of the cult of equity&amp;#8221; for persuading the trustees of the Imperial Tobacco
Pension Fund to allocate 100% of its investments to equities.
The world has never looked back, and even when (supposedly) funds exactly match their
cashflow liabilities with risk-free bonds, in fact they repo the bonds and punt the cash on equities, as we discovered when Kwasi Kwateng&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8216;mini-budget&amp;#8217; blew up the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; gilts&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all these complications, one would have thought that to understand the state of the economy, one should look at &amp;#8216;simpler&amp;#8217; assets like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt; or bonds, or commodities.
But Stan Druckenmiller argues otherwise. His point is that central banks are buying
trillions of fixed-income assets (in the Fed&amp;#8217;s case, maybe $9 T). The consequence of this
is industrial scale price manipulation.
Nobody makes a living trading JGBs these days: the Bank of Japan basically &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the market,
so their price bears no relationship to the state of the Japanese economy.
Really, much the same goes for treasury bonds and gilts. 
It&amp;#8217;s funny how the financial industry, and big business, is generally vehemently against
price controls on anything they sell, but seems anxious to retain them at all costs on 
money, something they buy (borrow), but this post is about&amp;nbsp;equity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, equities are the &amp;#8216;default investment asset,&amp;#8217; still, &lt;em&gt;pace&lt;/em&gt; bitcoin. 
They are, though, at the centre of the world&amp;#8217;s most epic bubbles: John Law&amp;#8217;s schemes
for the Bank of France, and the South Sea Bubble, to the point where 
governments simply banned companies from issuing shares for a very long time,
until they relented to facilitate the funding of railways in Victorian&amp;nbsp;times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, I equities are a bit scary, but as a retail investor, I feel I actually might have
some edge looking at nano-cap entities which simply have too small a float
for any professional investor to get involved.
 It&amp;#8217;s not easy, though. Small cap stocks can be buffeted by forces way beyond their&amp;nbsp;control.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Alternative Investments Edition</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/alternative-investments-edition.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-01-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-01-04T21:38:36+00:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2023-01-04:/alternative-investments-edition.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;2023-01-04&lt;/h1&gt;

which is all about the history of venture capital, and

&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;#8217;s a down&amp;nbsp;round?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve recently got interested in venture capital.
I just finished &amp;#8220;The Power Law&amp;#8221; by Sebastian Mallaby, 
which is all about the history of venture capital, and 
why it worked so well in Silicon Valley and why it has been so
hard to transplant it to other soil, in spite of the (arguably) 
huge economic benefits to those other soils of doing&amp;nbsp;so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venture capital is different to private equity.
Private equity takes boring, cash-generative 
businesses by stripping out all activities that do not
generate cash refinances them, largely by replacing
equity with debt, so the structure is more &amp;#8216;efficient&amp;#8217;
but much more fragile.
Venture capital takes businesses with barely exist,
except in the mind&amp;#8217;s eye of the founders, 
and provides pure equity funding, and hopes for the best
(while taking a modest equity&amp;nbsp;stake).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of wrinkles that both &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PE&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VC&lt;/span&gt; have developed over the years,
to reduce tax, incentivize the owners and managers to operate the business
in the best possible way, but this picture is roughly right. 
One big similarity, is that shares in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PE&lt;/span&gt;- and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VC&lt;/span&gt;-funded businesses are not traded
on public markets, and so they both have a lot of opacity about what they are really&amp;nbsp;worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The masterful Matt Levine &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-01-04/private-markets-don-t-like-to-go-down"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;  one way in which venture capital managers 
pretend to the world that the assets they manage appear never to lose value.
Basically, you issue new shares with extra rights, but you pretend they are the same as the old shares, which makes it appear that the old shares have gone up in value when, in fact,
they have not. He is &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; worth reading, and for the moment his newsletter is still free!
(But, it seems, you have to pay to read it on the&amp;nbsp;website.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I think that a lot of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PE&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VC&lt;/span&gt; is &amp;#8216;marked to fantasy&amp;#8217; and really is no more than a geared version of public markets, but with an artificially lowered volatility.
I&amp;#8217;d love to find a way of shorting this stuff, but because it&amp;#8217;s all private that&amp;#8217;s 
almost impossible on public markets &amp;#8230; except, perhaps, one could short the shares 
of the managers (such as Blackstone) themselves.
&lt;em&gt;Do not try this at home.&lt;/em&gt; 
This probably won&amp;#8217;t work, but for safety, I&amp;#8217;d be trying to reduce my exposure to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PE&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VC&lt;/span&gt; as much as possible, that is, if I had&amp;nbsp;any.&lt;/p&gt;

It is on the way to becoming another &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USSR&lt;/span&gt;, or a Maoist state, which doesn&amp;#8217;t auger well for 
internal demand. Eventually, the West will find someone else to make its plastic toys,
but the short-run demand trend will surely be down if things go down for Xi.
Covid in China has been a disaster, which at the very least might 
impede growth for a few&amp;nbsp;quarters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even without these political problems, China has terrible demographics, like the rest of the world. Old people don&amp;#8217;t spend their time on jets circling the world. This is another headwind.
War, currently in Ukraine, but probably soon in Taiwan will be yet&amp;nbsp;another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The West seems hell-bent on killing demand for hydrocarbons, in the form of Net Zero promises. I am extremely sceptical that they can be delivered, but the current generation of leaders won&amp;#8217;t want to lose face by admitting this, so will double down on locking us into &amp;#8216;15 minute neighbourhoods.&amp;#8217; All businesses will want to burnish their &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESG&lt;/span&gt; credentials by using less&amp;nbsp;carbon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it&amp;#8217;s a long-shot, this maybe the decade when we finally get nuclear fusion to work 
viably. This has the potential to make a big difference to the demand for oil and&amp;nbsp;gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the supply side, things are also looking down:
- public (and private) markets are increasingly unwilling to finance dirty technologies,
- eventually, the West will stop the evil things that are happening in cobalt mining in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DRC&lt;/span&gt;, and will ban it,
- Biden and successors will keep banning pipelines to&amp;nbsp;Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, what will be the net effect on prices?
It is as clear as mud to me, but I think the big effect, the rising wealth of the world, and especially &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EM&lt;/span&gt; countries will be the decisive factor and that demand will increase
ahead of supply with a net effect of pushing prices up.
I could well be wrong, and a deep recession could push this trend out by a year or two,
but ultimately, I think oil will get more&amp;nbsp;expensive.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>What is to be done with bonds?</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/what-is-to-be-done-with-bonds.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-01-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-01-02T22:02:38+00:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2023-01-02:/what-is-to-be-done-with-bonds.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;2023-01-02&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The future of interest&amp;nbsp;rates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The Fed is gonna pivot!&amp;#8221; Yeah, well it will eventually, but J Powell wants to be Volker&amp;#8217;s second coming, not the hapless Arthur Burns. Even though, at the time, citizens were burning effigies of Volker, he has ascended to the pantheon of central bankers, and that&amp;#8217;s where Powell and Kuroda want to end up (the latter a lot sooner than the former). What this means for bonds and rates is anyone&amp;#8217;s guess, but I&amp;#8217;ll have a&amp;nbsp;go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest thing to happen last year, in macro terms, is that inflation is back, baby.
It&amp;#8217;s like 1973 all over again, and it has freaked out governments and investors alike, the former because tightening will cause govt. debt service to rocket, the latter because, well, discount rates will go up, which means that asset prices will go&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of killing inflation, somehow higher rates have to translate into reduced demand.
The two main channels for this are the housing market: rents and mortgage repayments get dearer, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt;: pushing up the interest rate pushes up the currency. The problem is that no country wants to have another country &amp;#8220;export its inflation&amp;#8221; to it, so interest rate rises end up being coordinated, muting the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt; channel, and piling all the misery onto the housing market and other capital-intensive activities (like&amp;nbsp;infrastructure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes governments actively undo the best efforts of central bankers, by just spending money to compensate those who lose from tight monetary&amp;nbsp;policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan, Europe, and emerging markets like Brazil and Mexico have problems which are different from each other, and different from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;. At the very least, I think this is going to finally make &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt; markets exciting&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From what I read, the most likely outcome, at least for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, is a recession this year, maybe Q1 or Q2, a swift pivot, followed by a tsunami of inflation in 2024, with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; trailing a long way behind Brazil and Mexico (and maybe other EMs).

&lt;p&gt;Stocks, like individuals, have character and personality. Some are high-strung, nervous, and jumpy: others are forthright, direct, logical. One comes to know and respect individual securities. Their action is predictable under varying sets of&amp;nbsp;conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets never stand still. They are very dull at times, but they are not resting at one price. They are either moving up or down a fraction. When a stock gets into a definite trend, it works automatically and consistently along certain lines throughout the progress of its&amp;nbsp;move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the move you will notice a very large volume of sales with gradually advancing prices for a few days. Then what I term a ‘Normal Reaction&amp;#8221; will occur. On that reaction the sales volume will be much less than on the previous days of its advance. Now that little reaction is only normal. Never be afraid of the normal movement. But be very fearful of abnormal&amp;nbsp;movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a day or two activity will start again, and the volume will increase. If it is a real movement, in a short space of time the natural, normal reaction will have been recovered, and the stock will be selling in new high territory. That movement should continue strong for a few days with only minor daily  reactions. Sooner or later it will reach a point where it is due for another normal reaction. When it occurs, it should be on the same lines as the first reaction, because that is the natural way any stock will act when it is in a definite trend. At the first part of a movement of this kind the distance above the previous high point to the next high point is not very great. But as time goes on you will notice that it is making much faster headway on the&amp;nbsp;upside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me illustrate: Take a stock that starts at 50. On the first leg of the movement it might gradual sell up to 54. A day or two of normal reaction might carry it back to 52.5 or so. Three days later it is on its way again. In that time it might go up to 59 or 60 before the normal reaction would occur. But instead of reacting, say, only a point or a point and one-half, a natural reaction from that level could easily be 3 points. When it resumes its advance again in a few days, you will notice that the volume of sales at that time is not nearly as large as it was at the beginning of the move. The stock is becoming harder to buy. That being the case, the next points in the movement will be much more rapid than before. The stock could easily go from the previous high of 60 to 68 or 70 without encountering a natural reaction. When that normal reaction does occur, it could be more severe. It could easily react down to 65 and still have only a normal decline. But assuming that the reaction was five points or thereabouts, it should not be many days before the advance would be resumed, and the stock should be selling at a brand new high price. And that is where the time element comes&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t let the stock go stale on you. After attaining a goodly profit, you must have patience but don&amp;#8217;t let patience create a frame of mind that ignores the danger&amp;nbsp;signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock starts up again, and it has a rise of six or seven points in one day, followed the next day by perhaps eight to ten points&amp;#8212;with great activity—but during the last hour of the day all of a sudden it has an abnormal break of seven or eight points. The next morning it extends its reaction another point or so, and then once more starts to advance, closing very strong. But the following day, for some reason, it does not carry&amp;nbsp;through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an immediate danger signal. All during the progress of the move it had nothing but natural and normal reactions. Then all of a sudden an abnormal reaction occurs — and by &amp;#8220;abnormal&amp;#8221; I mean a reaction in one day of six or more points from an extreme price made in that same day — something it has not had before, and when something happens abnormally stock-marketwise it is flashing you a danger signal which must not he&amp;nbsp;ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have had patience to stay with the stock all during its natural progress. Now have the courage and good sense to honor the danger signal and step&amp;nbsp;aside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not say that the- danger signals are always correct because, as I stated before, no rules applying to stock fluctuations are l00% right. But if you pay attention to them consistently in the long run you will profit&amp;nbsp;immensely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A speculator of great genius once told me:
&amp;#8220;When I see a danger signal handed to me, I don&amp;#8217;t argue with it. I get out! A few days later, if everything looks all right, I can always go back in again. Thereby I have saved myself a lot of worry and money. I figure it out this way. If I were walking along a railroad track and saw an express train coming at me sixty miles an hour, I would not be damned fool enough not to get off the track and let the train go by. After it had passed, I could always get back on the track again, if I desired.&amp;#8221; I have always remembered that as a graphic bit of speculative&amp;nbsp;wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every judicious speculator is on the alert for danger signals. Curiously, the trouble with most speculators is that something inside of them keeps them from mustering enough courage to close out their commitment when they should. They hesitate and during that period of hesitation they watch the market go many points against them. Then they say: &amp;#8220;On the next rally I&amp;#8217;ll get out!&amp;#8221; When the next rally comes, as it will eventually, they forget what they intended to do, because in their opinion the market is acting fine again. However, that rally was only a temporary swing which soon plays out, and then the market starts to go down in earnest. And they are in it—due to their hesitation. If they had been using a guide, it would have told them what to do, not only saving them a lot of money but eliminating their&amp;nbsp;worries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again let me say, the human side of every person is the greatest enemy of the average investor or speculator. Why shouldn&amp;#8217;t a stock rally after it starts down from a big advance? Of course it will rally from some level. But why hope it is going to rally at just the time you want it to rally? Chances are it won&amp;#8217;t, and if it does, the vacillating type of speculator will not take advantage of&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am trying to make clear to that part of the public which desires to regard speculation as a serious business, and I wish deliberately to reiterate it, is that wishful thinking must be banished; that one cannot be successful by speculating every day or every week; that there are only a few times a year, possibly four or five, when you should allow yourself to make any commitment at all. In the interims you are letting the market shape itself for the next big&amp;nbsp;movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have timed the movement correctly, your first commitment will show a profit at the start. From then on, all that is required of you is to be alert, watching for the appearance of the danger signal to tell you to step aside and convert paper profits into real&amp;nbsp;money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember this: When you are doing nothing, those speculators who feel they must trade day in and day out, are laying the foundation for your next venture. You will reap benefits from their&amp;nbsp;mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculation is far too exciting. Most people who speculate hound the brokerage offices or receive frequent telephone calls, and after the business day they talk markets with friends at all gatherings. The ticker or translux is always on their minds. They are so engrossed with the minor ups and downs that they miss the big movements. Almost invariably the vast majority have commitments on the wrong side when the broad trend swings under way. The speculator who insists on trying to profit from daily minor movements will never be in a position to take advantage of the next important change marketwise when it occurs.
Such weaknesses can be corrected by keeping and studying records of stock price movements and how they occur, and by taking the time element carefully into&amp;nbsp;account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many years ago I heard of a remarkably successful speculator who lived in the California mountains and received quotations three days old. Two or three times a year he would call on his San Francisco broker and begin writing out orders to buy or sell, depending upon his market position. A friend of mine, who spent time in the broker&amp;#8217;s office, became curious and made inquiries. His astonishment mounted when he learned of the man&amp;#8217;s extreme detachment from market facilities, his rare visits, and, on occasions, his tremendous volume of trade. Finally he was introduced, and the course of conversation inquired of this man from the mountains how he could keep track of the stock market at such an isolated&amp;nbsp;distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Well,&amp;#8221; he replied, &amp;#8220;I make speculation a business. I would be a failure if I were in the confusion of things and let myself be distracted by minor changes. I like to be away where I can think. You see, I keep a record of what has happened, after it has happened, and it gives me a rather clear picture of what markets are doing. Real movements do not end the day they start. It takes time to complete the end of a genuine movement. By being up in the mountains I am in a position to give these movements all the time they need. But a day comes when I get some prices out of the paper and put them down in my records. I notice the prices I recorded are not conforming to the same pattern of movements that has been apparent for some time. Right then I make up my mind. I go to town and get&amp;nbsp;busy.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That happened many years ago. Consistently, the man from the mountains, over a long period of time, drew funds abundant1y from the stock market. He was something of an inspiration to me. I went to work harder than ever trying to blend the time element with all the other data I had compiled. By constant effort I was able to bring my records into a co-ordination that aided me to a surprising degree in anticipating coming&amp;nbsp;movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Oil&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;ever since. In periods of recessions, oil demand would be below trend for a year or 2, and then meet the trend again. After being below trend in 2008 and 2009, oil demand went back to trend in 2010, as if no great recession happened. Could it do the same again? 2/6 &lt;a href="https://t.co/dXJk1SkVwE"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dXJk1SkVwE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Pierre Andurand 🇺🇦🌻🇫🇷🇪🇺 (@AndurandPierre) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AndurandPierre/status/1608391430816567296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 29, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The oil price has crashed in the second half of 2022.
It was going up uncontrollably until Russia invaded Ukraine, then it crashed, then it shot up again until June after which it has been downhill all the&amp;nbsp;way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bear case is that oil is a fossil fuel which is being phased out in favour of wind and solar.
I think that this is true, in the long run, but my view is that in the short run the demand for an easily transported highly energy-dense fuel driven by economic growth, particularly in newly industrializing countries, will outrun the drop in demand driven by the substitution effect of renewable&amp;nbsp;energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting unbiased information on these matters is virtually impossible. Nobody does research without funding, and there is no funding from genuinely disinterested sources, or at least this seems to be the case to me. Greta Thunberg and Bjorn Lomborg sometimes seem more like cult leaders than dispassionate commentators. I try to filter out the bias, but it&amp;#8217;s almost impossible. The reason that I tend to pay more attention to the renewables sceptics, like &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Mining_Atoms"&gt;B F Randall&lt;/a&gt;, is that they make their case with charts and numbers and an appeal to physics and economics to argue that however important decarbonization is, the world as it is currently constituted, cannot afford&amp;nbsp;it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was chatting the other day to someone who made the argument that probably the Pope is not a true believer. I&amp;#8217;m inclined to believe this myself. I suspect the same might even go to figures like Al Gore and Greta. Once you are principally known for promoting one particular world-view, your sense of self-worth and identity becomes very bound up with that same world view.

&lt;p&gt;All governments promise to &amp;#8216;fix&amp;#8217; the deficit, but no government dares to cut spending or raise taxes. The various factors that have sent rates to zero have allowed this unsustainable behaviour to continue for most of my&amp;nbsp;lifetime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is enormous, as I have said many times, but this article gives more detail on how large the problem is in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;. The situation in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; is almost certainly even&amp;nbsp;worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Weekly&amp;nbsp;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week did not see any major movements in any asset class:
- bond yields were up a tiny bit over the week. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; 10Y yield stands at 3.47%, which is the top of its range back in June. This is still higher than most developed countries, so it continues to give support to the dollar,
- &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; stocks were down for a second week, with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; down at 3850. After fairly violent up and down moves, it&amp;#8217;s back down to where it was in June and Sept. Nearly every equities market on the planet is down a similar amount, with the exception of Istanbul (in lira), a  market that most western traders have no hope of entering.
- Energy (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTI&lt;/span&gt; futures, near month) continues to drift down. There are lots of reasons to suppose that it&amp;#8217;s going higher in the long run, but the overall trend seems to be just going down fairly endlessly. A technical rally this week pushed it p 4.6% though.
  &lt;img alt="TradingView Crude near month" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/4TeLgHRA/"&gt;
  - Tesla is under pressure. Briefing.com had a good, balanced account on Friday:
    &amp;gt; Tesla avoids another crash after Musk&amp;#8217;s latest stock sale is disclosed, but troubles remain (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cathie Wood, Founder and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; of Ark Invest, is literally buying what Elon Musk is selling. From December 12 through December 14, the eccentric &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;Tesla&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) has unloaded nearly 22.0 mln shares of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; stock for a total of about $3.5 bln in proceeds. As &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; continued to skid lower on Wednesday afternoon, Wood added more than 74,000 shares of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; across three of her funds. With &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; shares plunging by about 55% so far this year, it&amp;#8217;s easy to understand the allure of taking a bet on the&amp;nbsp;stock.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the leading &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EV&lt;/span&gt; maker is attempting to navigate around a number of obstacles at the&amp;nbsp;moment.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Musk&amp;#8217;s penchant for selling &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; stock is one such impediment for the stock. Since last December, when Musk first hinted that he may buy Twitter, he has executed four substantial sales of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;, including this week&amp;#8217;s disposal. &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In total, Musk has raised about $23 bln in capital through &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; sales to help finance his $44 bln acquisition of Twitter. Even after these sales, Musk still holds nearly 425 mln shares of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt;, which means he still has plenty of dry powder remaining should he choose to unload more&amp;nbsp;stock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given Twitter&amp;#8217;s rough financial situation, which seems to be worsening by the day as more advertisers flee, it&amp;#8217;s not out of the question that Musk will tap into his &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; holdings again. In fact, many investors believed that Musk was done selling in August when he tweeted that his selling spree was over. That declaration proved to be false and now many are wondering what Musks&amp;#8217; true intentions&amp;nbsp;are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demand is on shaky ground, especially in China, where &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COVID&lt;/span&gt;-related restrictions continue to hinder economic growth. In November, passenger vehicle sales declined for the first time in six months and auto sales are expected to be relatively flat in 2023.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These demand concerns were amplified last week when &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; was planning to suspend its Model Y output at its Shanghai plant during the last week of the year. This news followed a &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report from December 5 that stated that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; was cutting its December Model Y production by 20% in Shanghai. The company later refuted the story, but investors took a &amp;#8220;where there&amp;#8217;s smoke, there&amp;#8217;s fire&amp;#8221; mindset, sending shares sharply lower that&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is not debatable is that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; has become more promotional in recent months as it looks to clear out inventory after ramping up production. In October, the company cut prices by 5-10% for the Model 3 and Model Y in&amp;nbsp;China. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although the stock has plummeted this year, shares are still quite expensive with a P/E hovering around 30x. Furthermore, the &amp;#8220;E&amp;#8217; component of that ratio could be poised for a drop as ASPs and automotive gross margin sink in the face of sluggish&amp;nbsp;demand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock is experiencing a reprieve from its sell-off today, even with the market taking a strong hit, likely due to the idea that the bad news surrounding Musk&amp;#8217;s stock sale is already priced in. Whether today&amp;#8217;s relative strength translates into a more lasting rebound remains to be seen, but we believe &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; is facing an uphill battle as Musk&amp;#8217;s attention and focus centers on his flopping Twitter&amp;nbsp;acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Drill, baby&amp;nbsp;drill!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.gorozen.com/blog/why-wont-energy-companies-drill"&gt;This abridged report&lt;/a&gt; tries to make sense of why, even though energy prices have been so high recently, oil companies still seem very slow to invest in production.
The argument is subtle. I will attempt to summarize it:

&lt;h2&gt;Drill, baby&amp;nbsp;drill!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.gorozen.com/blog/why-wont-energy-companies-drill"&gt;This abridged report&lt;/a&gt; tries to make sense of why, even though energy prices have been so high recently, oil companies still seem very slow to invest in production.
The argument is subtle. I will attempt to summarize it:
- investors are still refusing to value exploration companies at anything like sensible valuations, so it makes more sense for management to buy back existing shares, rather than deploy cashflow to new rigs,
- politicians want to strongly discourage new production, whether through windfall taxes or blocks on pipeline construction,
- drilling engineers know that nearly all the &amp;#8216;Tier 1&amp;#8217; reserves have been exploited, so boosting production will result in lower&amp;nbsp;margins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I think, this is all bullish for oil. When China emerges from Covid lockdowns properly, and some sort of resolution to the war in Ukraine is thrashed out, demand will pick up a lot and these factors limiting production will result in a big shortfall of supply.
Of course, &lt;em&gt;eventually&lt;/em&gt; production will respond, but these things take time.
New production cannot be turned on like a&amp;nbsp;spigot.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Matt Levine — hilarious and insightful</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/matt-levine-hilarious-and-insightful.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-12-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-01-12T18:55:46+00:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2022-12-14:/matt-levine-hilarious-and-insightful.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;2022-12-14&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is called a “pump-and-dump.” I don’t know why people keep falling for it? I guess the pictures of the Ferraris. Also a desire for investing to be &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt;, for it to be a &lt;em&gt;trick&lt;/em&gt; that you can learn from some clever insiders on a Discord. If I tell you “buying stock is about allocating capital to productive businesses and sharing, over the long term, in the value they create for society,” and some guy standing next to a Ferrari on Twitter says “buying stocks is about interpreting mysterious signals that tell you &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THIS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STOCK&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WILL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UP&lt;/span&gt; 200% &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THIS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AFTERNOON&lt;/span&gt;,” his theory sounds more fun, and it certainly sounds like it will make you more money more quickly than my theory. It &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; make &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt; more money more quickly. Like, the guy &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a successful day trader. It’s just that his secret is tricking&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say “you,” but I doubt anyone reading this column is actually getting tricked. This whole online subculture — people who go on Twitter and Discord so they can be tricked by pump-and-dump scammers — is quite large and very hard for me to understand. My assumption is that a lot of them think they are wise to the scam. If some pump-and-dump scammer pumps a stock, and you buy it a second after he pumps it and sell it a second before he dumps it, you can make money alongside him. You are knowingly playing hot potato; you are trying to follow his lead to take advantage of his &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; victims. Perhaps this will work, or perhaps it won’t and you’ll end up a victim too, but maybe it beats having a real&amp;nbsp;job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Inflation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The annual inflation rate in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; slowed for a fifth straight month to 7.1% in November of 2022, the lowest since December last year, and below forecasts of 7.3%.

&lt;h2&gt;Inflation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The annual inflation rate in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; slowed for a fifth straight month to 7.1% in November of 2022, the lowest since December last year, and below forecasts of 7.3%. It follows a reading of 7.7% in October. Energy cost increased 13.1%, below 17.6% in October, due to gasoline (10.1% vs 17.5%), fuel oil (65.7% vs 68.5%), and electricity (13.7% vs 14.1%). A slowdown was also seen in food prices (10.6% vs 10.9%) while prices of used cars and trucks declined by 3.3% (after a 2% rise in October). On the other hand, the cost of shelter increased faster (7.1% vs 6.9%). Compared to the previous month, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPI&lt;/span&gt; edged up only 0.1%, the least in three months, and also lower than forecasts of 0.3%. The shelter was by far the largest contributor rising by 0.6%, and more than offsetting a 1.6% drop in energy cost. Despite the bigger-than-anticipated slowdown, the annual inflation is set to remain more than three times the Fed&amp;#8217;s 2% target, pointing to broad price increases across the economy. source: &lt;a href="http://www.bls.gov/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; Bureau of Labor&amp;nbsp;Statistics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212; Trading&amp;nbsp;Economics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;#8216;miss&amp;#8217; of 20bp did the following:
- pushed up &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; equities by ~1% (most &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; of course),
- pushed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; 10Y yields down 10bp,
- pushed the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; down 1%,
- pushed crude up&amp;nbsp;2%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all predicated on the falling inflation pushing the Fed into a&amp;nbsp;pivot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about inflation, Mohammed El-Erian had an interesting &amp;#8216;Markets Insight&amp;#8217; piece in today&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt;. Basically, he said that the Fed needed to switch to a 3-4% inflation target, but that this would be impossible for political reasons.
By pretending to aim for 2% but really targetting 4%, Powell could appear before Congress and say &amp;#8220;We saw inflation coming down, our models said it would reach 2%, so we eased off the pressure on the brake, so we can have a longer glide path down to our target.&amp;#8221;
This is a lot better than saying &amp;#8220;Yes, well, our mandate is to maintain price stability. We were surprised you bought the idea that debasing the currency by 2% per year was the same thing, but meh, it works for us, and by the way we&amp;#8217;re going to target twice the old rate now, so prices will double every eighteen&amp;nbsp;years.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;#8217;ve said repeatedly, the only way out of this mess is to allow inflation to wash away the sins of fiscal incontinence. Nobody wants the alternative, which is markets carnage, not least because almost everyone in Congress, the Senate and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOMC&lt;/span&gt; is massively long risk assets. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, maybe poor people would like to see their credit card balances evaporate, and, hmm the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury would sure like to see bonds crash so they could be bought up for cents on the dollar but &amp;#8230; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, maybe there is a constituency for&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; has an insanely expensive health care system, because it has allowed its government to be captured by corporate and producer interest from insurers, doctors, hospital groups, and the  complex ecosystem of rent seekers who sit between patients and their treatment. The rest of the world has a variety of systems which are variations on a theme of a state-controlled insurer which collects premiums from taxpayers and largely pays out controlled prices to medical professionals. Patients mostly pay some modest fees for modest treatment. Except the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, where the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; is a sort of church, accountable to nobody, which doles out spotty healthcare in decrepit&amp;nbsp;hospitals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in most churches, the paid employees are mostly treated badly and paid poorly.
There are some very well-remunerated bishops, who are paid so much they decide to retire a decade before the rest of the working population, complaining that they pay so much tax that the vocation is&amp;nbsp;spent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the Church of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; dispenses a lot of good care, and the people love it. 
They even are &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; with the nuns getting a big increase in their pay (currently, maybe, as much as 19%), at least those who imagine that their tithes won&amp;#8217;t go up very much to pay for&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Church of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; is slow to respond to changing times, just like the poor old CofE.
Back in the late 1940&amp;#8217;s, illness was short and acute. You went to hospital and were fixed up, or you died. 
Now, sadly, disease is overwhelmingly chronic, either because it intrinsically is (Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s) or because we&amp;#8217;re so good at keeping previously fatal conditions under a sort of control that what used to kill us simply makes us miserable and disabled (like diabetes or cancer or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt;), or because we&amp;#8217;ve redefined some extreme positions on various personality dimensions as pathological, a condition we now call mental&amp;nbsp;illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a mess, and although everyone knows we can&amp;#8217;t keep increasing the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; spend &lt;em&gt;ad infinitum&lt;/em&gt; no politician wants the person who says &amp;#8220;Enough is enough!&amp;#8221; 
All this, I&amp;#8217;m sure is painfully familiar to everyone. Especially everyone who was born more than fifty years ago. But I guess we&amp;#8217;ll continue in a state of political denial until &amp;#8230; something turns&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Covid&amp;nbsp;Conspiracy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://harvard2thebighouse.substack.com/p/no-monkey-ever-reheated-a-frozen-624"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; argues that gain-of-function research played a role in the origins of Covid-19.
It&amp;#8217;s by Dan Sirotkin, who might or might not have attended Harvard, but who did spend time in prison, but is a join author of some serious-looking academic papers (e.g. &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03910v2.pdf"&gt;this …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;2022-12-08&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://harvard2thebighouse.substack.com/p/no-monkey-ever-reheated-a-frozen-624"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; argues that gain-of-function research played a role in the origins of Covid-19.

&lt;p&gt;Arthur C Clarke said that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. My corollary is that any sufficiently advanced scientific paper is indistinguishable from mumbo jumbo. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair"&gt;The Sokal Hoax&lt;/a&gt; is a data point that supports this version, in a very strong&amp;nbsp;form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I read the Covid paper, and it read as though it was based on solid science and some evidence, but the limits of my knowledge and willingness to do follow-up research means that it could equally well be a complete hoax. To believe it, you have to swallow something close to a conspiracy theory. Harold Wilson believed that he was being monitored by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MI5&lt;/span&gt;, something that most right-thinking folk believe was a fantasy, but it seems that &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/mi5-kept-secret-file-on-harold-wilson-1797187.html"&gt;there might have been something to it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, linking Harold with Covid seems a&amp;nbsp;stretch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stole the title for today&amp;#8217;s post from Sirotkin&amp;#8217;s post heading. I didn&amp;#8217;t actually know where it came from, but Google showed&amp;nbsp;me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;“It killed humans, therefore it was a weapon. But radiation killed humans, and a medical X-ray machine wasn’t intended as a weapon. Holden was starting to feel like they were all monkeys playing with a microwave. Push a button, a light comes on inside, so it’s a light. Push a different button and stick your hand inside, it burns you, so it’s a weapon. Learn to open and close the door, it’s a place to hide things. Never grasping what it actually did, and maybe not even having the framework necessary to figure it out. No monkey ever reheated a frozen burrito.”

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was mildly risk-on, with big swings in commodities, especially oil.
Yields were mostly up, global stock markets mostly drifting down still, although &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; markets were up, probably helped by the dollar weakening at bit.
Long-dated bonds, and credit (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AGG&lt;/span&gt;) have continued their bull market, dating back may be six weeks.
The traditional &amp;#8220;Santa rally&amp;#8221; seems to be missing in action this year, unless it&amp;#8217;s very late.
China seems so inept, corrupt and generally evil, it&amp;#8217;s hard to see things returning fully to normal. Without China&amp;#8217;s flood of cheap labour pushing up the price of the complementary capital it&amp;#8217;s hard to see things ever returning to zero nominal interest rates&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gilts were weak, but the pound rallied a bit (just the dollar going down because of weak new claims figures). Generally, more vicious bear curve flattening in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; rates.&amp;nbsp;Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tech&amp;nbsp;corner&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I installed Fedora 37 on an old Dell workstation. 
It&amp;#8217;s great.
There is the odd glitch, though, affecting mounting samba shares (Windows fileservers).
Basically, the problem is that you must specific vers=2.0 on the mount line in your&amp;nbsp;/etc/fstab:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//winserve/sharename       /mnt/sharename      cifs    username=steve,password=********,gid=1000,uid=1000,vers=2.0      0       0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should put this on stackexchange or something, but I don&amp;#8217;t have enough kudos to post in those places, which is a&amp;nbsp;pity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s confusing is that nautilus will happily let you browse the share, but when you try to use a command line &lt;code&gt;mount&lt;/code&gt; command, it fails, and worse, you get a warning that you may  need to specify &lt;code&gt;vers=1.0&lt;/code&gt;. It seems that in fact the default is to use version 1.0, but that Windows rejects this protocol, because it&amp;#8217;s unsafe, (but with a confusing error message).
You get something like &amp;#8216;the server abruptly terminated the&amp;nbsp;connection&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mount line in fstab must specify a gid and uid, because otherwise the files in the share will be owned by root, which is not good. There are plenty of articles on&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I normally hit some barrier when using linux on my desktop, which may be very minor but which ultimately forces me back to Windows. This time, I feel, is actually&amp;nbsp;different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use a lot of linux utilities, such as hledger (an accounting program). These have been ported to Windows, but the just don&amp;#8217;t work as well, probably because the developers port them as a chore and shoot back to their preferred linux&amp;nbsp;environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Kneading Dough</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/kneading-dough.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-12-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-12-08T21:17:30+00:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2022-12-07:/kneading-dough.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;2022-12-07&lt;/h1&gt;

A: &lt;em&gt;Because they always knead (need)&amp;nbsp;dough.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, I apologize. I was reminded of that joke from my infancy when I saw that wheat, a crop that is heavily dependent on artificial fertilizers, is cheaper now than it was a year ago. Nitrate fertilizers have one non-free ingredient, which is natural gas (or, potentially another form of energy). This was not supposed to happen. Expensive energy was supposed to give rise to expensive fertilizer, which was supposed to drive up the price of wheat and corn. (Soybeans are a bit different, because they can synthesize their own bound nitrogen from the&amp;nbsp;air.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe wheat is about the same price; the chart was not easy to read. It certainly has come down in price a lot since the&amp;nbsp;summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, commodities were all over the place today. Oil down, gas up, silver up, gold up a bit, copper up. Bond yields were down across the piste, with the exception of India, up 2bp.
The vicious bear flattening of yesterday reversed slightly, but don&amp;#8217;t say&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8216;steepener&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s amazing that plants can create their own ammonia (symbiotically with some type of bacteria). Regular fertilizer is made by the Haber process, which is incredibly energy-intensive. Vast amounts of natural gas is needed for this. 
Some work is being done on alternatives, e.g. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15314-9"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, but I&amp;#8217;m surprised it&amp;#8217;s not more&amp;nbsp;widespread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Politicians&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw some chart of public perceptions of the integrity of politicians over time.
It&amp;#8217;s dire. Fewer than 10% of Americans respect members of Congress. 
I didn&amp;#8217;t see figures for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, but my guess would be that we are even more cynical about members of both houses. The latest scandal is the &amp;#8216;bra tycoon&amp;#8217; Lady Mone. 
How does one even become a lingerie entrepreneur? &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/politics/20679547/michelle-mone-loses-tory-whip/"&gt;Read more in The Sun&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most energy commodities were hammered today. The following is Trading Economics gloss on the&amp;nbsp;move:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTI&lt;/span&gt; crude futures dropped more than 4% to below $74 per barrel, the lowest since December 2021, as sentiment remained clouded by concerns about weak global demand. Advanced economies, especially the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; and Europe, are witnessing a drop in manufacturing activity due to tightening financial conditions. On top of that, better-than-expected &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; services and jobs data stoked worries that the Fed will need to remain aggressive for longer. Still looking for the demand side but putting a floor under prices, China has been dialing back virus curbs following widespread protests, with several cities scrapping testing requirements that have hindered movement in the world’s top crude importer. On the supply front, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OPEC&lt;/span&gt;+ decided to stick to their existing policy of reducing oil output by 2 million barrels a day from November through 2023. Investors were also assessing the impact of the latest sanctions on Russia, including a price cap and a European Union embargo on seaborne imports of Russian&amp;nbsp;oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; that a price cap of $60/barrel will make essentially no difference to Russia, as that&amp;#8217;s what it&amp;#8217;s oil is selling at&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas and energy usage in Europe has dropped a lot, as industry has put off consumption, and the weather has been very mild for October and November. It&amp;#8217;s cold now (believe it, I am&amp;nbsp;freezing!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oil crash dragged down all risk assets and has increased the bear flattening, with 10Y yields down nearly 9bp. Practically every last global stock-market was down a point or&amp;nbsp;two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Universities, subjects, selectivity and their effects on graduate&amp;nbsp;income&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927537122001580?via%3Dihub"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is rather interesting. Going to a highly selective institution, to study a competitive subject like economics, makes a big difference to your earnings potential. 
I believe that this is mostly down to signalling effects, but that doesn&amp;#8217;t make it any less&amp;nbsp;real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s interesting how economics is such an outlier subject. Studying it makes a bigger impact on future earnings than studying law or medicine, or even computer&amp;nbsp;science. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a bit depressing that studying maths, physics or chemistry have such a meh effect on earnings&amp;nbsp;potential.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Don’t eat nuclear waste</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/dont-eat-nuclear-waste.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-12-05T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-03-23T13:24:54+00:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2022-12-05:/dont-eat-nuclear-waste.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;2022-12-05&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The problem with nuclear&amp;nbsp;waste&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://worksinprogress.substack.com/p/a-tale-of-two-particles?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email"&gt;Read this!&lt;/a&gt;
It is by far the best account I have ever read about what to do about waste from fission reactors.
There is a lot of irrational fear about nuclear power, because the physics that allows power stations to work is the same physics that gave us Hiroshima.
The waste products of nuclear reactors are dangerous, especially immediately after they have been removed from the reactor. 
But storing them above ground in concrete casks is the correct way to handle the problem. The consensus always used to be to bury the waste deep underground in inaccessible &amp;#8216;geological&amp;#8217;&amp;nbsp;storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post explains better than I ever could why this is a terrible idea. 
Oddly enough, I worked on a project to examine the feasibility of doing just this, but without any understanding of the biological effects of the three types of radiation caused by radioactive decay. 
It is only gamma rays that really damage tissue; sure, you don&amp;#8217;t want to ingest an alpha emitter: those helium nucleii can do a lot of damage. 
But they are stopped by a minimal barrier, unlike gamma rays which carry no charge and therefore can penetrate deep into tissue, sometimes passing right through it, but too often damaging &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the piece explains why gamma emission decays relatively quickly compared to beta and alpha emission, resulting in a drop which is for all practical purposes complete within 500 years. This sounds a long time, but Pu239 has a half-life of 250K&amp;nbsp;years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other fantastic point that the article makes is that U238 and Pu are both fissile in the right reactor. Because of a highly successful campaign by Friends of the Earth, no western government dared continue (or even start) a fast-breeder research programme. Although fast-breeder reactors are hugely challenging to build, they hold huge potential for the production of low-cost carbon-free energy. Although I would prefer this to come from fusion reactors, it would seem sensible to continue research into this technology, which surely will become acceptably safe and economic at some point in the next few&amp;nbsp;decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Trends&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fabricatedknowledge.com/p/trend-watch-edition-1?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email"&gt;It seems&lt;/a&gt; that consumers of cosmetics are switching from skincare to fragrances, 
and Millennials are giving up vaping and switching to smoking. Weird, or&amp;nbsp;what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuit (seller of expensive bookkeeping and tax-accounting software and accidental owner of Mailchimp and Credit Karma) is in trouble, &lt;a href="https://thebearcave.substack.com/p/problems-at-intuit-intu"&gt;according to Edwin Dorsey&lt;/a&gt;.
Oddly enough, I&amp;#8217;ve used Mailchimp, Quickbooks and Credit Karma. I think, ages ago, I even paid for a copy of Quickbooks. I did notice that Credit Karma does do a lot of heavy selling of credit cards, although I&amp;#8217;ve trained myself to ignore that sort of&amp;nbsp;crap.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Expensive ‘sub-standard’ buffaloes</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/expensive-sub-standard-buffaloes.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-03-23T13:24:54+00:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2022-12-01:/expensive-sub-standard-buffaloes.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;2022-12-01&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ramaphosa&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president of South Africa had $580K in notes stolen from a farm. He believes that keeping notes stuffed in a sofa is a better idea than keeping them in a safe. And, of course it&amp;#8217;s entirely normal to pay cash for a transaction involving more than half a million dollars, and nothing to do with concealing the true nature of the transaction. I&amp;#8217;m sure the revelations will be bullish for the rand, as further evidence that South Africa is a well-managed and advanced economy and&amp;nbsp;democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Ramaphosa denies wrongdoing. His version of the story is that the cash taken from the sofa ($580,000, he says) came from the sale of 20 “substandard” buffaloes to a Sudanese businessman on Christmas Day in 2019. The money went in the sofa, he says, because it was thought to be safer than the farm’s safe. After learning of the theft a few weeks later, he reported the matter to his protection team, which is a branch of the police. The president also argues that, while he is the ultimate owner of the game farm, he is not involved in day-to-day operations, and therefore not in breach of constitutional rules regarding conflicts of&amp;nbsp;interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;we&lt;/span&gt;’&lt;span class="nv"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;some&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;business&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;earn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;some&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;fees&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;And&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;life&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;banker&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt Levine nails it every day. He is a super-bright individual, who has worked for Goldman and as a clerk of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Court and as an M&amp;amp;A lawyer at a big &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NY&lt;/span&gt; City firm (Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Katz). But you do wonder why Goldman product bankers earn quite so many millions of pounds a year, if this is the job they do.
Of course, their real job is to be smarter than their clients, so they can convincingly answer the question &amp;#8220;are you sure it&amp;#8217;s a good idea to do this deal?&amp;#8221; 
Their pay just reflects artificial shortage of people who can do that, because it&amp;#8217;s so hard to pass through all the loops into these positions. This is certainly the view of Paul Collier (see&amp;nbsp;https://socialeurope.eu/rent-seeking).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;I&amp;#8217;m&amp;nbsp;back&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been on holiday, and since coming back trying to catch up with my day job.
Fortunately, the market seems to have been completely directionless in November.
There are big macro factors at play, but none of them seem close to being resolved.
The Fed is strenuously denying that it is about to pivot, but that&amp;#8217;s exactly what you&amp;#8217;d expect it to do immediately before it announces a pivot.
I know that central bankers generally tell you exactly what they are going to do, but when it comes to U-turns, I&amp;#8217;m not so sure.
The war in Ukraine is getting pretty grim. Russia is destroying the infrastructure of the country, the act of a petty, vindictive madman. 
Some way or other, surely, both sides must be longing for an end to the destruction of property and resources. 
China continues with its zero-covid strategy, years after the rest of the world has moved on and accepted that it&amp;#8217;s far too damaging to the economy to stick with the policy.
In fact, the knock-on effects of loose fiscal policy in 2020 and 2021 are now feeding through into blazing inflation and a red-hot jobs market, as well as public services that are struggling to recruit competent&amp;nbsp;staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most statistical measures are now forecasting a recession. 
Commodities have been weak, but not as weak as stocks.
I have a vague feeling that on the balance of probabilities, news from now on will be net bullish for risk assets. 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; does not have to grow for a bear market to die of old&amp;nbsp;age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t have any hard evidence, but my feeling is that European assets may benefit most.
Energy costs are driving the continent into recession, but this, surely, is in the price, and energy prices are certainly no longer going up strongly. Crude occasionally makes an effort to rally, but the curve is still in backwardation, which I associate with falling future spot&amp;nbsp;prices.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>The Challenge of Speculation</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/the-challenge-of-speculation.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-11-22T20:22:54+00:00</published><updated>2022-11-22T20:22:54+00:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2022-11-22:/the-challenge-of-speculation.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHALLENGE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPECULATION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game of speculation is the most uniformly fascinating game in the world. But it is not a game for the stupid, the mentally lazy, the man of inferior emotional balance, nor for the get-rich-quick adventurer. They will die&amp;nbsp;poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a long period of years …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHALLENGE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPECULATION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game of speculation is the most uniformly fascinating game in the world. But it is not a game for the stupid, the mentally lazy, the man of inferior emotional balance, nor for the get-rich-quick adventurer. They will die&amp;nbsp;poor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a long period of years I have rarely attended a dinner party including strangers that someone did not sit down beside me and after the usual pleasantries inquire:
&amp;#8220;How can I make some money in the market?&amp;#8221; In my younger days I would go to considerable pains to explain all the difficulties faced by the one who simply wishes to take quick and easy money out of the market; or through courteous evasiveness I would work my way out of the snare. In later years my answer has been a blunt I don&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;know.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to exercise patience with such people. In the first place, the inquiry is not a compliment to the man who has made a scientific study of investment and speculation. It would be as fair for the layman to ask an attorney or a surgeon:
&amp;#8220;How can I make some quick money in law or surgery?&amp;#8221;
I have come to the conviction, however, that larger numbers of people interested in stock-market investment and speculation would be willing to
work and study to attain sensible results, if they had a guide or signpost pointing the right direction. And it is for them that this book is&amp;nbsp;written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is my purpose to include some of the highlights of a lifetime of speculative experience—a record of some of the failures and successes and the lessons that each has taught. Out of it all emerges my theory of time element in trading, which I regard as the most important factor in successful speculation - but before we go further, let me warn you that the fruits of your success will be in direct ratio to the honesty and sincerity of your own effort in keeping your own records, doing your own thinking, and reaching your own&amp;nbsp;conclusions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot wisely read a book on &amp;#8220;How to Keep Fit&amp;#8221; and leave the physical exercises to another. Nor can you delegate to another the task of keeping your records, if you are to follow faithfully my formula for combining the time element and prices, as set forth in subsequent&amp;nbsp;pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only light the way, and I shall be happy, if through my guidance, you are able to take more money out of the stock market than you put&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book, I present to that portion of the public, which at times may be speculatively inclined, some points and ideas which have been garnered during my many years as an investor and speculator. Anyone who is inclined to speculate should look at speculation as a business and treat it as such and not regard it as a pure gamble as so many people are apt to do. If I am correct in the premise that, speculation is a business in itself, those engaging in that business should determine to learn and understand it to the best of their ability with informative data available. In the forty years which I have devoted to making speculation a successful business venture, I have discovered and still am.
discovering new rules to apply to that&amp;nbsp;business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On many occasions I have gone to bed wondering why I had not been able to foresee a certain imminent move, and awakened in the early hours of the ensuing morning with a new idea formulated. I was impatient for the morning to arrive in order to start checking over my records of past movements to determine whether the new idea had merit. In most cases it was far from being 100% right, but what good there wais in it was stored away in my subconscious mind. Perhaps, later, another idea would take form and I would immediately set to work checking it,&amp;nbsp;over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In time these various ideas began to crystallize and I was able to develop a concrete method of keeping records in such a form that I could use them as a&amp;nbsp;guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My theory and practical application have proved to my satisfaction that nothing new ever occurs in the business of speculating or investing in securities or commodities. There arc times when one should speculate, and just as surely there are times when one should not speculate. There is a very true adage: &amp;#8220;You can beat a horse race, but you can&amp;#8217;t beat the races.&amp;#8221; So it is with market operations. There are times when money can be made investing and speculating in stocks, but money cannot consistently be made trading every day or every week during the year. Only the foolhardy will try it. It just is not in the cards and cannot be&amp;nbsp;done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To invest or speculate successfully, one must form an opinion as to what the next move of importance will be in a given stock. Speculation is nothing more than anticipating coming movements. In order to anticipate correctly, one must have a definite basis for that anticipation. For instance, analyze in your own mind the effect, marketwise, that a certain piece of news which has been made public may have in relation to the market. Try to anticipate the psychological effect of this particular item on the mind of the public— particularly that portion of the public which primarily is interested. If you believe it likely to have a definite bullish or bearish effect marketwise, don&amp;#8217;t trust your own opinion and back your judgment until the action of the market itself confirms your opinion because the effect marketwise may not be as pronounced as you are inclined to believe it should&amp;nbsp;be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate: After the market has been in a definite trend for a given period, a bullish or bearish piece of news may not have the slightest effect on the market. The market itself at the time may be in an overbought or oversold condition, in which case the effect of that particular news would certainly be ignored. At such times the recording value of past performances under similar conditions becomes of inestimable value to the investor or speculator. At such times he must entirely ignore personal opinion and apply strict attention to the action of the market itself. Markets are never wrong—opinions often are. The latter are of no value to the investor or speculator unless the market acts in accordance with his ideas. No one man, or group of men, can make or break a market&amp;nbsp;today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One may form an opinion regarding a certain stock and believe that it is going to have a pronounced move, either up or down, and eventually be correct in his opinion but will lose money by presuming or acting on his opinion too soon. Believing it to be right, he acts immediately, only to find that after he has made his commitment, the stock goes the other way. The market becomes narrow, he becomes tired and goes out. Perhaps a few days later it begins to look all right, and in he goes again, but no sooner has he re-entered it than it turns against him once more. Once more he begins to doubt his opinion and sells out. Finally the move starts up. Having been too hasty and having made two erroneous commitments, he loses courage. It is also likely that he has made other commitments and is not in a position to assume more. Thus, by the time the real move in the stock he jumped into prematurely is on, he is out of&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point I would here emphasize is that after forming a definite opinion with respect to a certain stock or stocks—do not be too anxious to get into it. Wait and watch the action of that stock or stocks marketwise. Have a fundamental basis to be guided by. Say, for instance, a stock is selling around $25.00 and has been holding within a range of $22.00 to $28.00 for a considerable period. Assuming that you believe that the stock should eventually sell at $50.00 and it is $25.00 at the time, and in your opinion it will sell at $50.00 have patience and wait until the stock becomes active, until it makes a new high, say around $30.00. You will then know that marketwise you have been&amp;nbsp;justified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock must have gone into a very strong position, or it would not have reached $30.00. Having done so, it is altogether likely that it is on its way to a very definite advance— the move is on. That is the time for you to back your opinion. Don&amp;#8217;t let the fact that you did not buy at $25.00 cause you any aggravation. The chances are if you had, you would have become tired of waiting and would have been out of it when the move started, because having once gotten out at a lower price, you would have become disgruntled and would not have gone back in when you should&amp;nbsp;have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experience has proved to me that the real money made in speculating has been in commitments in a stock or commodity showing a profit right from the start. Later on, when some examples of my trading operations are given, you will notice I made my first trade at the psychological time—that is, at a time where the force of the movement was so strong that it simply had to carry through. Not on my operation but because the force was so strong behind that particular stock. It simply had to and did go. There have been many times when I, like many other speculators, have not had the patience to await the sure thing. I wanted to have an interest at all times. You may say: &amp;#8220;With all your experience, why did you allow yourself to do so?&amp;#8221; The answer to that is that I am human and subject to human&amp;nbsp;weakness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all speculators, I permitted impatience to out-maneuver good judgment. Speculation is very similar to playing a game of cards, whether it be poker, bridge or any similar game. Each of us is possessed with the common weakness of wanting to have an interest in every jackpot, and we certainly would like to play every hand at bridge. It is this human frailty which we all possess in some degree that becomes the investor&amp;#8217;s and speculator&amp;#8217;s greatest enemy and will eventually, if not safeguarded, bring about his downfall. It is a human trait to be hopeful and equally so to be fearful, but when you inject hope and fear into the business of speculation, you are faced with a very formidable hazard, because you are apt to get the two confused and in reverse&amp;nbsp;positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an illustration: You buy a stock at $30.00. The next day it has a quick run-up to $32.00 or $32.50. You immediately become fearful that if you don&amp;#8217;t take the profit, the next day you may see it fade away—so out you go with a small profit, when that is the very time you should entertain all the hope in the world. Why should you worry about losing two points&amp;#8221; profit which you did not have the previous day? If you can make two points profit in one day, you might make two or three the next, and perhaps five more the next week. As long as a stock is acting right, and the market is right, do not be in a hurry to take a profit. You know you are right, because if you were not, you would have no profit at all. Let it ride and ride along with it. It may grow into a very large profit, and as long as the action of the market does not give you any cause to worry, have the courage of your convictions and stay with&amp;nbsp;it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, suppose you buy a stock at $30.00 and the next day it goes to $28.00, showing a two-point toss. You would not be fearful that the next day would possibly see a three-point loss or more. No, you would regard it merely as a temporary reaction, feeling certain that the next day it would recover its loss. But that is the time that you should be worried. That two- point loss could be followed by two points the next day or possibly five or ten within the next week or two. That is when you should be fearful, because if you do not get out, you might be forced to take a much greater loss later on. That is the time you should protect yourself by selling your stock before the loss assumes larger&amp;nbsp;proportions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profits always take care of themselves but losses never do. The speculator has to insure himself against considerable tosses by taking the first small loss. In so doing, he keeps his account in order so that at some future time, when he has a constructive idea, he will be in a position to go into another deal, taking on the same amount of stock as he had when he was wrong. The speculator has to be his own insurance broker, and the only way he can continue in business is to guard his capital account and never permit himself to lose enough to jeopardize his operations at some future date when his market judgment is correct. While I believe that the successful investor or speculator must have well-advanced reasons for making commitments on either side of the market, I feel he must also be able through some form of a specific guide to determine when to make his first&amp;nbsp;commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me repeat, there are definitely certain times when a movement really gets underway, and I firmly believe that anyone who has the instinct of a speculator and has the patience, can devise a specific method to be used as a guide which will permit him to judge correctly when to make his initial commitment. Successful speculation is anything but a mere guess. To be consistently successful, an investor or speculator must have rules to guide him. Certain guides which I utilize may be of no value to anyone else. Why is that so? If they are of inestimable value to me, why should they not serve you equally well? The answer to that is— no guide can be l00% right. If I use a certain guide, my own pet one, I know what should be the result. If my stock does not act as I anticipated, I immediately determine the time is not yet ripe — so I close out my commitment. Perhaps a few days later my guide indicates I should get in again, so back I go, and probably this time it is l00% correct. I believe anyone who will take the time and trouble to study price movements should in time be able to develop a guide, which will aid him in future operations or investments. In this book I present some points which I have found valuable in my own speculative&amp;nbsp;operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great many traders keep charts or records of averages. They chase them around, up and down, and there is no question that these charts of averages do point out a definite trend at times. Personally, charts have never appealed to me. I think they are altogether too confusing. Nevertheless, I am just as much of a fanatic in keeping records as other people are in maintaining charts. They may be right, and I may be&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My preference for records is due to the fact that my recording method gives me a clear picture of what is happening. But it was not until I began to take into consideration the time element that my records really became useful in helping me to anticipate coming movements of importance. I believe that by keeping proper records and taking the time element into consideration—and I shall explain this in detail later—one can with a fair degree of accuracy forecast coming movements of importance. But it takes patience to do&amp;nbsp;so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Familiarize yourself with a stock, or different groups of stocks, and if you figure the time element correctly in conjunction with your records, sooner or later you will be able to determine when a major move is due. If you read your records correctly, you will pick the leading stock in any group. You must, I repeat, keep your own records. You must put down your own figures. Don&amp;#8217;t let anyone else do it for you. You will be surprised how many new ideas you will formulate in so doing, ideas which no one else could give to you, because they are your discovery, your secret, and you should keep them your&amp;nbsp;secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I offer in this book some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DONT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;S for investors and speculators. One of the primary rules is that one should never permit speculative ventures to run into investments. Investors often take tremendous losses for no other reason than that their stocks are bought and paid&amp;nbsp;for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How often have you heard an investor say: ‘I don&amp;#8217;t have to worry about fluctuations or margin calls. I never speculate. When I buy stocks, I buy them for an investment, and if they go down, eventually they will come&amp;nbsp;back.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But unhappily for such investors many stocks bought at a time when they were deemed good investments have later met with drastically changed conditions. Hence such so-called &amp;#8220;investment stocks&amp;#8221; frequently become purely speculative. Some go out of existence altogether. The original &amp;#8220;investment&amp;#8221; evaporates into thin air along with the capital of the investor. This occurrence is due to the failure to realize that so-called &amp;#8220;investments&amp;#8221; may be called upon in the future to face a new set of conditions which would jeopardize the earning capacity of the stock, originally bought for a permanent investment. Before the investor learns of this changed situation, the value of his investment is already greatly&amp;nbsp;depreciated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore the investor must guard his capital account just as the successful speculator does in his speculative ventures. If this were done, those who like to call themselves &amp;#8220;investors&amp;#8221; would not be forced to become unwilling speculators of the future—nor would trust fund accounts depreciate so much in their&amp;nbsp;value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will recall not so many years ago it was considered safer to have your money invested in the New York, New Haven &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Hartford Railroad than to have it in a bank. On April 28, 1902, New Haven was selling at $255 a share. In December of 1906, Chicago, Milwaukee &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; St. Paul sold at $199.62. In January of that same year Chicago Northwestern sold at $240 a share. On February 9 of that year Great Northern Railway sold at $348 a share. All were paying good&amp;nbsp;dividends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at those &amp;#8220;investments today: On January 2, 1940, they were quoted at the following prices:
New York, New Haven &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Hartford Railroad $0.50 per share; Chicago Northwestern at which is about $0.31 per share; Great Northern Railway at $26.62 per share. On January 2, 1940, there was no quotation for Chicago, Milwaukee &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; St. Paul but on January 5, 1940, it was quoted at $0.25 per&amp;nbsp;share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be simple to run down the list of hundreds of stocks which, in my time, have been considered gilt-edge investments, and which today are worth little or nothing. Thus, great investments tumble, and with them the fortunes of so-called conservative investors in the continuous distribution of&amp;nbsp;wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculators in stock markets have lost money. But I believe it is a safe statement that the money lost by speculation alone is small compared with the gigantic sums lost by so-called investors who have let their investments&amp;nbsp;ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my viewpoint, the investors are the big gamblers. They make a bet, stay with it, and if it goes wrong, they lose it all. The speculator might buy at the same time. But if he is an intelligent speculator, he will recognize—if he keeps records— the danger signal warning him all is not well. He will, by acting promptly, hold his losses to a minimum and await a more favorable opportunity to reenter the&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a stock starts sliding downward, no one can tell how far it will go. Nor can anyone guess the ultimate top on a stock in a broad upward movement. A few thoughts should be kept uppermost in mind. One is: Never sell a stock, because it seems high-priced. You may watch the stock go from 10 to 50 and decide that it is selling at too high a level. That is the time to determine what is to prevent it from starting at 50 and going to 150 under favorable earning conditions and good corporate management. Many have lost their capital funds by selling a stock short after a long upward movement, when it seemed too&amp;nbsp;high.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, never buy a stock because it has had a big decline from its previous high. The likelihood is that the decline is based on a very good reason. That stock may still be selling at an extremely high price—even if the current level seems low. Try to forget its past high range and study it On the basis of the formula which combines timing and&amp;nbsp;price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may surprise many to know that in my method of trading, when I see by my records that an upward trend is in progress, I become a buyer as soon as a stock makes a new high on its movement, after having had a formal reaction. The same applies whenever I take the short side. Why? Because I am following the trend at the time. My records signal me to go ahead! I never buy on reactions or go short on&amp;nbsp;rallies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other point: It, is foolhardy to make a second trade, if your first trade shows you a loss. Never average Losses. Let that thought be written indelibly upon your&amp;nbsp;mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore the question further, our study estimated a relationship for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; per capita in which a change in income inequality was added to standard growth drivers such as physical and human capital.

&lt;p&gt;To explore the question further, our study estimated a relationship for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; per capita in which a change in income inequality was added to standard growth drivers such as physical and human capital. The idea was to test whether the change in income inequality over time has had a significant impact on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; per capita on average across &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OECD&lt;/span&gt; countries, and if this influence differs according to whether inequality is measured in the lower or upper part of the distribution. The results show that the impact is invariably negative and statistically significant: a 1% increase in inequality lowers &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; by 0.6% to 1.1%. So, in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OECD&lt;/span&gt; countries at least, higher levels of inequality can reduce &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; per capita. Moreover, the magnitude of the effect is similar, regardless of whether the rise in inequality takes place mainly in the upper or lower half of the&amp;nbsp;distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This summary paragraph is from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OECD&lt;/span&gt; paper &lt;a href="https://www.oecd.org/economy/growth-and-inequality-close-relationship.htm"&gt;Growth and inequality: A close relationship?&lt;/a&gt;. To me, this makes perfect sense. Kleptocracies result in those in power stealing all the added value of commerce, which destroys the incentive of the producers to produce. 
Real democracies, where the government produce &amp;#8216;public goods&amp;#8217; for the population at large do better than dictatorships where the leaders distribute all the net returns of the economy to their cronies. Of course, there is a continuum from a perfect democracy to a place like The Congo under Mobutu Sese Seko, but this is intuitively obvious, but is explained at book-length by Acemoglu and Robinson in &lt;em&gt;Why Nations&amp;nbsp;Fail.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a perspective of demand management, it seems much more natural to tweak demand by redistributing from those with a low propensity to save to those with a high one, i.e. from the rich to to the poor. Of course, if inflation does run too hot, possibly reversing the policy might have to be tried. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; gini coefficient has gone up a lot since 1977, to today, although it has not moved a great deal since 1990, &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/872472/gini-index-of-the-united-kingdom/"&gt;according to Statistica&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The deficit&amp;#8221; is now regarded with absolute terror by the government, but at least if transfer payments from rich to poor were increased to offset the effect of increased taxation and reduced public spending, this would at least tend to offset the collapse in aggregate demand and thereby the likely depth of the recession. 
As forecasters seem to be talking of a ten-year recession, coming after agonizingly slow growth since 2008, now surely is the time to try something more radical than abolishing a cap on bankers&amp;#8217;&amp;nbsp;bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>2022-11-10</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/2022-11-10.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-11-22T20:22:54+00:00</published><updated>2022-11-22T20:22:54+00:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2022-11-22:/2022-11-10.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Pivot&amp;nbsp;coming?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is crypto implosion enough to create a true safety bid?  Probably not, but Steph Pomboy notes that Ontario Teachers Pension was a major investor in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTX&lt;/span&gt;, and succinctly tweeted, “My point is that it isn’t just &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OTPP&lt;/span&gt;, it’s every pension (no doubt).  Only way to deliver on 8% return mandates in a 0% risk free rate world is via reckless risk.  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THIS&lt;/span&gt; is the silent but deadly consequence of yrs of repressive rates imposed by the Fed…”  Apart from monetary losses at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FTX&lt;/span&gt;, job losses are being announced at an increasing clip.  Meta cut 11k jobs or 13% or its workforce.  Redfin also cut 13%, totaling 892, and closed the home-flipping business.  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DR&lt;/span&gt; Horton , the largest &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; homebuilder, reported net sales orders for July-Sept fell 15% from a year earlier, and fell 10% in value.  Chicago Fed’s Evans said it’s time for the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes.  Trades in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOFR&lt;/span&gt; calls are already reflecting that sentiment, for example late trade of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SFRF3&lt;/span&gt; 9550c for 2.25 ref 9501 in underlying &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SFRH3&lt;/span&gt;.  The six-month calendar Dec’22/June’23 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOFR&lt;/span&gt; settled +44.5 (bias toward hike in the beginning of the year), but June’23/Dec’23 settled negative 35.5, essentially forecasting the erasure of a hike early in the year.  Prices: 9541, 9496.5,&amp;nbsp;9532.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;–Today’s news includes &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPI&lt;/span&gt;, expected 7.9% yoy vs 8.2%, with Core 6.5 from 6.6.  Jobless Claims expected 220k.  Thirty year&amp;nbsp;auction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed is still sounding hawkish, but with this carnage, it can&amp;#8217;t be long before it pivots. Nothing brings down inflation like a purging dose of&amp;nbsp;recession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market tone today was dominated by the idea that inflation is coming down, and that the Fed is about to stop hiking.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPI&lt;/span&gt; came in at 7.7% YoY (vs 8% expected) for Oct.
The idea that inflation coming in 30bp below expectation will result in an about-turn by the Fed is &amp;#8230; optimistic. But if you assume that the Fed&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; mandate is to keep securities markets high (and, admittedly, government funding cheap), then it makes sense. 
Anyway, the markets reacted with whoops of joy:
- &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; up 5.34%,
- the 20Y yield down by 25bp,
- &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; down 2.25%,
- copper up 3% @ $3.81/lb.
The curve flattening is over, although rates have come down right across the&amp;nbsp;curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Image&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="@raylivez1" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FhN30pBXkAEWSoL?format=jpg&amp;amp;name=medium"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thought for the&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthcare is prioritized in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; because political power is concentrated in the hands of the old. 
Since 2005, spending on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; has doubled, whereas spending on schools has slightly gone done (in real terms), but still no politician can be heard arguing for shutting a hospital to allow a new school to be built.
There are many examples of politicians focussing on wedge issues that will never be resolved in favour of more important issues that could be resolved if there was a political will. One that irks me more than most is the regime in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; which is almost designed to encourage inward transfers from oligarchs and organized crime. 
In spite of promises deliver transparency of ultimate beneficial ownership to places like Companies House and the Land Registry, it&amp;#8217;s quite clear that there is no real political will available for&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might imagine that this state of affairs would benefit the Left, but in fact many voters believe that politicians on the Left are naive and more likely to be captured by oligarchs than those on the Right. I don&amp;#8217;t believe that, but Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson both demonstrated that the Right have no monopoly on their willingness to hob-nob with Russian&amp;nbsp;oligarchs.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Have fun getting poor</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/have-fun-getting-poor.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-11-22T20:22:54+00:00</published><updated>2022-11-22T20:22:54+00:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2022-11-22:/have-fun-getting-poor.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;date 19 May&amp;nbsp;2022&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.epsilontheory.com/the-macguffin-part-1/"&gt;The crypto scam&lt;/a&gt;.
Ben Hunt, of Epsilon Theory fame, talks about crypto.
He concludes it&amp;#8217;s a scam, but interestingly links in &lt;em&gt;Animal Farm&lt;/em&gt; (possibly my favourite political book of all time) and Bill Clinton and Tony Blair, as well as Matt Levine (my new hero) and Sam Bankman-Friend (boo!).
Anyway, you gotta read it, but I wanted to talk about Blair and&amp;nbsp;Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know much about Clinton, but I do know a bit about Blair. 
The latter is famously technophobic. 
He can&amp;#8217;t use a keyboard, and had never sent an email until after he&amp;#8217;d left office as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt;.
He told the world that if we didn&amp;#8217;t spend a fortune on new software planes would drop out of the skies on 1 Jan 2000 because
they would be crippled by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;Y2K&lt;/span&gt; bug (yeah, remember that?). Oh, he also said that Saddam had &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WMD&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the guy has form, and it&amp;#8217;s not good form, for seeing the future, especially in the tech space.
But, well, he&amp;#8217;s a favourite of the Davos crowd, and he craves attention, especially from a hip crowd so I guess he thought &amp;#8220;why not?&amp;#8221; I&amp;#8217;m sure the fee was lucrative too.
Anyway, now Clinton and Blair are shilling crypto, the end must, surely, be near.
&amp;#8220;Have fun getting poor!&amp;#8221; as the crypto-Ponzis used to (almost)&amp;nbsp;say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trend&amp;nbsp;following&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book &lt;em&gt;The Man Who Solved the Market&lt;/em&gt; is an interesting, but at the same time a frustrating read.
It explains how Jim Simons used sophisticated statistical tools to extract information about future price movements
from price histories.
A huge body of financial economic theory is predicated on the idea that this is simply not possible, and that securities prices follow a martingale process. 
A long time ago, I knew something about the rather complex theory of derivatives pricing that arises from this&amp;nbsp;approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the book focusses, like all popular books, on the personalities of the people involved, and avoids equations or really any mathematical discussion of how Simons did it. 
There is a huge literature and discussion of this topic on the Internet, but to me the important thing is that the widespread copying of these approaches by various hedge funds has resulted in valuations, in the sense that Graham and Dodd understood it, being completely irrelevant.
For a lot of modern investors, a high P/E ratio is a buy signal. 
Well, as Graham himself said, in the short term the market is a voting machine, but in the long term it&amp;#8217;s a weighing machine.
The problem is that he didn&amp;#8217;t say that the short term might persist for four&amp;nbsp;decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My understanding is that modern (&amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AI&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221;) and trend-following models are solving for slope in equities, not the endpoint. 
The problem is that momentum is reflexive. Soros was right: a rising price makes a stock more attractive to buyers (unlike the demand curve for a commodity, where the price elasticity of demand is always negative or at best zero).
As more money flows to funds which use this trend-following approach, prices will rise as a consequence of limited supply and rising demand.
Again, conventional economics with its static picture of supply and demand schedules doesn&amp;#8217;t really work&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This synchronized snowball effect of rising demand has resulted in exponential growth in prices of disruptor and lockdown-beneficiary stocks, like Peleton ($&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PTON&lt;/span&gt;).
Except now the whole thing has gone into reverse. 
With no assets, no profits and shrinking turnover, it&amp;#8217;s hard to see that the end for these stocks is other than&amp;nbsp;delisting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only question is whether the effect will spill over to mainstream indexes, like $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt;. 
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FANG&lt;/span&gt;+ stocks are a big part of this index now. 
As investors de-lever, it&amp;#8217;s hard to see the main index bucking the trend.
If the flow into passive equity funds reverses, 
we are likely to see a vicious down&amp;nbsp;spiral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most investors are instinctively long stocks, as they perceive that central banks will be incapable of stemming the money supply.
Central bank are finding out now that a 2% (or 2.5%) inflation is harder to hit than they thought.
In this environment, bonds are going to get smoked, so what&amp;#8217;s left? 
So far gold has failed spectacularly to act as a hedge.
My best guess is soft commodities, like corn, the demand for which will be minimally hit by a recession, but to be perfectly honest, I am far from convinced that agricultural commodity futures will not themselves be dragged down by the increasing cost of carry that will be imposed by central&amp;nbsp;banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inflation, as properly defined, is an expansion of the money supply.
The classic way of thinking about it is if we went to bed one night, and when we woke up we found that the balance in our current accounts had doubled, the notes in our wallets had magically reproduced, and our debts had done likewise.
Nothing would have changed, except we&amp;#8217;d have to hand over twice as many notes in the grocery store.
The recent &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPI&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PCE&lt;/span&gt; prints are not like that.
A few items have gone through the roof, the others have not.
I think from here on in, the high prices will not reverse, but we won&amp;#8217;t see an endless inflation.
The oil price rise will drain spending power from everything else, and I don&amp;#8217;t think people are 
bringing forward purchases.
Hopefully, wages will rise to offset the spike of inflation, but this won&amp;#8217;t turn into a spiral.
I don&amp;#8217;t think we&amp;#8217;ll see hoarding. It&amp;#8217;s hard to do with petrol,&amp;nbsp;anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPI&lt;/span&gt; hit 8.3%, YoY, but this was less than expected.
Bonds rallied a bit (10Y @2.92%).
Commodities spiked, but oil is only at $105, well below the peak it reached in March ($120).
Currencies didn&amp;#8217;t move much. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; at&amp;nbsp;103.8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the most violent move was in&amp;nbsp;commodities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tech stocks were hit, e.g. $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TSLA&lt;/span&gt; down 6.6%, which pulled the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDX&lt;/span&gt; down 2.25%. Other &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; indices were much less hit, but still negative.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPX&lt;/span&gt; is now below 4000, having been at 4800 as recently as Dec.

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; and its implication for&amp;nbsp;inflation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMT&lt;/span&gt; says that governments can keep printing money and investing it to take up the slack in the economy until it hits full employment. Knowing whether there is real inflation, or just random disconnected price spikes is hard to know, and politicians will always hope for the&amp;nbsp;best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under this framework, fiscal policy can be used to control inflation, but not monetary policy. Pushing rates up to the point where (real) &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; goes down is just not part of the program. The Fed surely does not want to let the long end of the curve go much above the short end. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; govt. has a lot of long-dated debt to refinance. The problem with trying to use fiscal policy is that voters won&amp;#8217;t stand for higher taxes, so it will be too little, too&amp;nbsp;late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Lapolla thinks that Fed Funds are capped wherever you think nominal &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; is (1% population growth + 2% inflation = 2.50%/3.00% max approx..) 
It&amp;#8217;s hard to see productivity growth getting off the ground, because of the aging workforce.
I think that old people can be productive, but they are not good at changing entirely their way of working.
I speak from&amp;nbsp;experience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a problem for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, but probably more of a problem for the rest of the world. Of all advanced economies, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; has the best demographics, certainly if it&amp;#8217;s willing to accept more migrants from Latin&amp;nbsp;America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does this mean in practice? I think that bonds have gone down as far as they are likely to, but that commodity prices will continue to&amp;nbsp;rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would anything change under a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GOP&lt;/span&gt; administration? I don&amp;#8217;t think so.
All governments understand that voters want more stuff.
They cannot get it by being more productive, so they have to be fooled by the money illusion of inflation, rising nominal wages, and disappearing returns on&amp;nbsp;savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently finished reading &amp;#8220;The Managerial Revolution&amp;#8221; by James Burnham.
It&amp;#8217;s not a business book, but a book about political theory. 
It was written in 1941, in the middle of the second world war, when it looked as though Hitler would win, and at a time when the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; had suffered over a decade of depression with a very mixed success of the &amp;#8220;New Deal&amp;#8221; of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FDR&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burnham, like many of his contemporaries, had been a communist, presumably because of the visible failure of capitalism revealed by the terrible economic suffering of the West during the Great Depression. He rejected communism, but believed that capitalism could never deal with the problem of unemployment and was for this reason on the way to being supplanted by some other system, just as feudalism had been four hundred years&amp;nbsp;previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point at which his ideas departed from those of Marx was that he did not believe that socialism, as envisioned by Marx, would ever come about. 
He observed that the practical obstacles to devolving power down to the masses, without any sort of ruling class, were insuperable. 
So he concluded that the result would be what he could see was happening in Germany, a sort of rule by bureaucrats. Power would be balanced by a complex web of patronage from the political centre, but the capitalists would hand over the control of physical capital and would lose control of how the product of that capital was distributed. He gave the example of the large corporates in Germany, whose factories had been turned over to war production. He predicted that the capitalists&amp;#8217; fond ideas that their factories would be returned to their control at the conclusion of the war was unrealistic, and that whatever the legal form of ownership, actual decisions about production and distribution would be made by a cadre of administrators, for their benefit, rather than for the benefit of the capitalists, or, for that matter the benefit of the proletariat. (He did concede that enough output would need to be allocated to the masses to prevent social unrest,&amp;nbsp;though.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the book (amazingly) was a best seller at the time, the fact that it assumed that the Axis powers would win the war presumably made people doubt the accuracy of Burnham&amp;#8217;s other predictions. Although in detail he was not that accurate, I think the broad outline of his predictions were correct. In 2020 the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; government spent around 60% of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;. 
Most business activity now is subject to huge numbers of regulations, which are administered by an army of bureaucrats. They are not plutocrats, but they are pretty well paid compared to the median worker. As Burnham himself pointed out, it took a very long time for capitalism to fully replace feudalism, and that many of the individual nobles and aristocrats who benefited from feudalism mutated into capitalists. I feel we have some way to go before capitalism is dead, but I don&amp;#8217;t think it will last forever, and Burnham&amp;#8217;s ideas about what will replace it seem as good as any I&amp;#8217;ve come&amp;nbsp;across.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me that Burnham might have influenced Eisenhower&amp;#8217;s thinking about the dangerous rise of the &amp;#8216;military-industrial complex,&amp;#8217; which is a perfect example of the what Burnham was talking about: a cadre of unelected officers taking control of very large resources and directing the value-added to a selected group. Nowadays it&amp;#8217;s more like the military-industrial-intelligence agency complex&amp;nbsp;though.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>World of Atoms</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/world-of-atoms.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-11-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-11-22T20:22:54+00:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2022-11-15:/world-of-atoms.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Today in&amp;nbsp;markets&lt;/h1&gt;

I&amp;#8217;m not entirely sure who which group is most deserving.
The whole business of carving up society into sections, classes, factions (etc.), I think, damages the ability of the democratic process to deliver the best overall outcome for society.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OPEC&lt;/span&gt; revised down each of its 2022 and 2023 oil demand growth forecasts by 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) from last month’s estimates due to China’s still-strict Covid policy and economic challenges in Europe, the organization &lt;a href="https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/publications/338.htm"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in its Monthly Oil Market Report (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MOMR&lt;/span&gt;) out on&amp;nbsp;Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China, and specificially China&amp;#8217;s Zero-Covid policy, is the culprit.
Xi is mad, but at least he&amp;#8217;s making oil cheaper for the rest of the world.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTI&lt;/span&gt; Crude futures were down 4% today, presumably because of this&amp;nbsp;report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities were mixed, but &amp;#8212; like oil &amp;#8212; were penalized by a stronger dollar, which itself was linked to slightly higher rates. A Fed Governor (Waller) made a speech saying that there was some way to go before the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOMC&lt;/span&gt; could ease up on rate&amp;nbsp;hikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; Autumn&amp;nbsp;Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; Chancellor of the Exchequer will announce his autumn statement (which is a budget in all but name) on Thursday. 
It has been heavily trailed, and there are going to be a lot of tax rises and a lot of spending cuts. I&amp;#8217;ve seen figures like £55 B. 
The goal is to get rates at the long end down, and thereby reduce the cost of financing with gilts. I guess it&amp;#8217;s to get inflation down too, so index-linked gilts will provide cheaper funding. 
The problem is that cutting the government&amp;#8217;s funding cost is the same as pumping up asset prices. 
You can&amp;#8217;t separate the two.
With the world borrowing something of the order of $310T, this debt simply is never going to be paid back. 
The Bank of England could be arm-twisted into cranking up &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; and doing yield-curve control. 
They wouldn&amp;#8217;t like it, but we are still in an emergency situation, as far as I&amp;#8217;m concerned, and this would be the lesser of two evils.
The further redistribution of wealth to the very rich is going to cause a political crisis. 
I am not sure whether Jeremy Hunt is a bootlegger or a Baptist: probably he&amp;#8217;s a bit of both, but the failure to even discuss the redistributional consequences of what is being called Austerity 2.0 is&amp;nbsp;appalling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that a lot of this $310T of debt is notionally in the private sector, but we all know when there is a systemic collapse of debt in the private sector, as there was in 2008, governments invariably bail out the private sector, for understandable reasons (I concede, reluctantly). My rough reckoning is that this debt burden amounts to about four years of global &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;. Most individuals cannot devote more than a few percent of their income to debt service and repayment. Logically, this must be true in&amp;nbsp;aggregate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial indications seem to be that the Republicans have taken Congress, but the Dems have held onto control of the Senate.
The party discipline in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; politics has broken down so much that maybe this doesn&amp;#8217;t matter, but it&amp;#8217;ll be difficult to increase taxes or commit to new spending plans because of the gridlock. This is usually good for bonds, but Oxford Economics is predicting that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; federal government will hit their debt ceiling, which might freak out the bond&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today crude sagged because &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; wholesale inventories continued to grow. People are simply not driving as much as they used to. The Zoom&amp;nbsp;effect?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason, the curve steepened strongly, while oil went down. 
I guess the mid-terms must be the driver, but I don&amp;#8217;t really understand why that should be the case. Maybe the Dems did better than expected. 
The Treasury curve has been in a &amp;#8216;bear flattening&amp;#8217; phase for too long. At some point, JPoww is going to pivot, but the most certain thing in the universe is that he won&amp;#8217;t give any &amp;#8216;forward guidance&amp;#8217; on&amp;nbsp;when.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Gridlocks is good for bonds</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/gridlocks-is-good-for-bonds.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-11-08T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-11-22T20:22:54+00:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2022-11-08:/gridlocks-is-good-for-bonds.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;An ageing planet and the future path of interest&amp;nbsp;rates&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2022/10/05/elderly-populations-mean-more-government-spending"&gt;The Economist has a special report about ageing societies and mounting public sector&amp;nbsp;debt.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s hard to summarize fully, but the argument is that it&amp;#8217;s hard for governments to contain spending when their populations are ageing and demand more pensions and health benefits, but produce very little and therefore do not contribute much in taxes (certainly net of what they&amp;nbsp;receive).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, ageing populations have been able to get away with this by lending to younger countries to allow their growing populations to combine with a growing capital stock to boost the world&amp;#8217;s output (especially of tradeable goods). Sadly, that doesn&amp;#8217;t work if all countries are getting old together, and the big one, China, is well down that path. A path which, surely, Xi Jin Ping will fail to block off, in spite of his attempts to make citizens produce more&amp;nbsp;children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion would be that interest rates are going up. Of course, demographics is only one of many reasons for this. It&amp;#8217;s seems impossible to think they won&amp;#8217;t and yet this has been true for a long time, and long-term yields are still very&amp;nbsp;low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is another factor. China is going to implode at some point. 
Its banks turn empty blocks of flats and unused roads and bridges into money.
This flood of money causes interest rates to remain low, especially as China sells a ton of stuff to the West on tick, which drives global interest rates down (China is a huge buyer of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury Bonds). Japan also invests a lot in&amp;nbsp;China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the implosion happens, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RMB&lt;/span&gt; will collapse, probably the banks will fail (they are state owned, so it&amp;#8217;s not clear what failing would look like). This will unleash a tsunami of deflation throughout the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The excess liquidity in the Eurodollar system is what Jeff Sneider at Eurodollar University is always banging on about, along with the fact that the dollar curve is inverted a lot which means that a big recession is on its way. (And I can confirm from experience that the inversion, or at least flattening, is still&amp;nbsp;happening.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds are still too dear for inflation to stick at above 4%. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s a reverse China shock which will be the event that the market has priced&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am writing this at 1650 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMT&lt;/span&gt;, so &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; markets have a long time before closing.
From what I can see, we have the following trends:
- (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;) bonds are up, yields are down. Presumably, on the assumption that the economy is going down the pan, and that the Fed is about to pivot, and that the mid-terms will see the Democrats lose their slim majority in Congress, and possibly in the Senate too. (I think the theory is that with what France describes as &amp;#8216;cohabitation&amp;#8217;: different tiers of govt. controlled by opposing parties, )
- the dollar continues to drift lower, which I guess is reflective of the drift in yields and the assumption of a pivot, but also of the expectation that a recession will heal the trade deficit (unless it&amp;#8217;s a synchronized global one, which is not inconceivable).
- oil is down, about 1%, but after a good run so far in&amp;nbsp;November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I&amp;#8217;m&amp;nbsp;reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/commodities/asymmetric-payoff-why-goldman-sees-gold-soaring-30-when-fed-starts-cutting-rates"&gt;Gold may yet have its day.&lt;/a&gt;
It seems amazing that with inflation hitting 10% in most of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OECD&lt;/span&gt;, that the gold price has barely changed in a year. 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, it has in terms of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBP&lt;/span&gt;, but not &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt;, which is the price metric almost always used.
Given that almost nobody alive has experienced a time when gold was important for settling trade imbalances, I can see why most people don&amp;#8217;t want to have anything to do with the barbaric relic. At least oil, coal, copper, and silver have genuine real consumption demand, not to mention nickle, cobalt, germanium and&amp;nbsp;neodymium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Everyone hates copper, uranium, gold, silver. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s time to go long some producers. For example, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FCX&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CCJ&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GOLD&lt;/span&gt;, $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PAAS&lt;/span&gt;. Not a recommendation, but they are all very hated right now. If we really are getting hyperinflation, Barrick Gold could literally be a gold mine. Uh, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, it would be&amp;nbsp;anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The gilts meltdown has shown the markets how quickly things can get ugly. The market have decided that gilts are a safe bet again, but how can they be sure that rebellious Conservative MPs who are going to be out of parliament next time can be whipped into voting for austerity yet again? If they don&amp;#8217;t the finance bill will not pass and gilts will melt down&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will China open up silently and boost demand for copper etc.? I have no idea, but I doubt if Xi will tell the world before he tells his&amp;nbsp;cronies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0387c6fd-1c18-4ea8-bb70-bfa6b4537347"&gt;Antonio Foglia attributes the strength of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; dollar to unwinding of hedging trades&lt;/a&gt; The argument is that if the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Long Bond has dropped by 20%, foreign holders who buy it for yield but then hedge out the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt; risk by selling spot &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; will have had to buy back a lot of spot &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; to keep themselves hedged. If they lose interest in USTs, this will happen more. Sounds more plausible than &lt;a href="https://money-act.com/milkshake-theory/"&gt;the milkshake theory&lt;/a&gt; although much less compelling from a visual point of&amp;nbsp;view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fear and loathing on the road to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f86779b2-f5d0-4376-b109-ae12ff94b04e"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is&amp;nbsp;fantastic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has gone away is our ability to hide the problem. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt;, negative interest rates and rising indebtedness were the product and palliative of a condition caused by a prolonged deceleration in productivity growth to an average pace not seen since the 19th century. Real wages stagnated for several decades on the back of this deceleration, whilst asset prices soared due to the evaporation of risk-free interest rates. By redistributing shares of wealth and income to the high-saving top 10 per cent, the economic mix ensured that demand and inflation fell short, simultaneously dismantling the social contract that keeps politics non-toxic. Meanwhile, zero interest rates worsened the productivity slowdown by artificially prolonging the lifespan of the least productive enterprises. Then came Covid. In an economic condition of parlous growth, most developed countries responded to the shock by spending money, largely financed by central bank printing presses — some 13 per cent of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, 21 per cent in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;. This was a live experiment with the magic money tree, a policy long advocated as an antidote for the slow growth&amp;nbsp;condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZIRP&lt;/span&gt; has anaesthetized politics, but we&amp;#8217;re waking up from narcosis into a world of fear and loathing. Eventually, something has to give, and there will be some redistribution and a return to normal productivity growth (which, in the long run really is&amp;nbsp;everything).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The cost of Net&amp;nbsp;Zero&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As periodic reminder, the global energy transition to net zero will cost $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;150TN&lt;/span&gt;, or $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;5TN&lt;/span&gt; per year for 30 years, as much as the entire annual &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; tax base (BofA). This means that the next crash will need to unleash global &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QE&lt;/span&gt; from every central bank to the tune of $3-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;5TN&lt;/span&gt;/year &lt;a href="https://t.co/T6OXQ9f0Kk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/T6OXQ9f0Kk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; zerohedge (@zerohedge) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/1588591399791984640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 4, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks and commodities were firmer Friday, with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; indices trailing global peers, as growing expectations around China reopening fuelled &amp;#8216;reopening&amp;#8217; trades in the backdrop of a mixed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFP&lt;/span&gt; report. The Dollar saw pronounced selling with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; down 2% at pixel time, its biggest daily fall since 2015, coming against broad non-Dollar currency strength, particularly the China-levered antipodes. Oil prices bounced by c. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USD&lt;/span&gt; 4/bbl, their largest jump in a month, while industrial metals such as copper surged 8%. The Treasury curve saw pronounced steepening with inflation breakevens widening. While on the Fed path, money markets pared the terminal rate down slightly whilst moving further in favour of a 50bps December hike (vs 75bps) after the mixed October &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFP&lt;/span&gt; report did little to argue against the Fed&amp;#8217;s aims to decelerate the pace of&amp;nbsp;tightening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8212;&amp;nbsp;Newsquawk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; turbocharged commodities generally, including gold, gold miners etc. It feels like we&amp;#8217;re near a turning point in rates. Lots of chatter about Fed announcements, but if the Fed were going to pivot, they&amp;#8217;d definitely send out the governors to throw up a lot of chaff to hide their intention from the&amp;nbsp;radar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;https://journals.lww.com/co-cardiology/Abstract/2007/01000/Cost_effectiveness_of_automated_external.3.aspx&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summary: While highly targeted provision of automated external defibrillators in areas of greatest risk, such as casinos and airports, may be cost-effective, it will have little impact at a population level. Provision of more widespread public access defibrillation to sites with lower incidence of cardiac arrest is unlikely to be cost-effective, and may represent poorer value for money than alternative healthcare interventions in coronary artery&amp;nbsp;disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23074470/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OPALS&lt;/span&gt; study model appears cost-effective, and effectiveness can be further enhanced by training community volunteers to improve the bystander-initiated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPR&lt;/span&gt; rates. Deployment of AEDs in all public access areas and in houses and apartments is not cost-effective. Further research is needed to examine the benefit of in-home use of AEDs in patients at high risk of cardiac&amp;nbsp;arrest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that people have terrible intuition about the frequency of occurrence of low-probability events. The proliferation of automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) in public places is a classic example of this. They are expensive to maintain and almost never save any lives, but they keep getting purchased by well-meaning public- and private-sector bodies who do not know any better but believe what the sellers of these devices tell them. (Yes, I know it&amp;#8217;s quite conceivable that these have saved some lives, but (i) it&amp;#8217;s never possible to definitely say that someone would have died without one of these things and (ii) if you really believe that if some lives are saved then buying an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AED&lt;/span&gt; will have been worth it, maybe you&amp;#8217;d like to advocate for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MRI&lt;/span&gt; scans for everyone on a daily&amp;nbsp;basis.)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>FOMC hikes again</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/fomc-hikes-again.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-11-03T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-11-22T20:22:54+00:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2022-11-03:/fomc-hikes-again.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOMC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;day&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks and Treasuries were lower while the dollar was bid with markets continuing to react to Wednesday&amp;#8217;s hawkish press conference from Fed Chair Powell. Aside from Powell, we saw the BoE and Norges bank rate decisions where the former hiked by 75bps, as expected, but saw two dovish dissenters (Tenreyro even voted for a smaller 25bp hike rather than Dhingra&amp;#8217;s choice of a 50bp move). It also noted rates are unlikely to go as high as what markets are pricing in. The Norges bank hiked by 25bps in fitting with prior guidance but was on the smaller side of market expectations. Treasuries saw strong bear-flattening in continued post-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOMC&lt;/span&gt; fallout with two-way flows post-BoE. Crude prices saw selling pressure in fitting with risk and a stronger dollar. Attention now turns to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFP&lt;/span&gt; on Friday, where consensus looks for a 200k rise although do note that the White House Press Secretary spoke where she said she expects job gains of 150k over the coming months. There were several data points on Thursday too, the Challenger layoffs saw the highest number of job cuts announced in a single month since February 2021 at 33.8k. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISM&lt;/span&gt; Services &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PMI&lt;/span&gt; fell by more than expected while prices paid rose and employment slipped into contractionary territory. Jobless claims were marginally better than expected while &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; trade saw a wider deficit than expected. The Q3 labour costs rose 3.5%, less than the 4.1% expectation and cooling heavily from the prior pace of 8.9%, which was revised down from 10.2%. Geopolitical tensions are rife with what appears to be daily missile tests from North Korea and it is something worth keeping an eye on, with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; and others requesting a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UN&lt;/span&gt; Security Council meeting on Friday to discuss North Korea, while the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; and South Korea have pledged to extend military drills in response to the missile&amp;nbsp;firing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sommacrostrategies.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOM&lt;/span&gt; Macro Strategies&lt;/a&gt; argues in its latest newsletter that higer rates  will benefit corporate credit. The idea seems to be that interest cost is fully allowable, and that as CBs pause the current tightening cycle, corporate debt will start to benefit.
I am still nervous about going long debt into a recession, but I guess that it is logical that in a recession rates collapse, and that equity takes the first hit. 
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOM&lt;/span&gt; points out that in inflation-adjusted terms, debt in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SP500&lt;/span&gt; companies isn&amp;#8217;t particularly high. It suggests that as rates come back down, firms will start to buy back debt, supporting the&amp;nbsp;price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I sort of understand the thesis, the $&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AGG&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETF&lt;/span&gt;, which is a portfolio of corporate credit, does not look too&amp;nbsp;healthy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMF&lt;/span&gt; warns Europe that it&amp;#8217;s in deep&amp;nbsp;trouble&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2022/10/23/europe-must-address-a-toxic-mix-of-high-inflation-and-flagging-growth"&gt;In this blog post&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IMF&lt;/span&gt; points out that Europe is in a very bad&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, our latest Regional Economic Outlook shows that the pandemic and Russia’s war in Ukraine might have fundamentally altered the inflation process, with rising input and labor shortages contributing notably to the recent high-inflation episode. This suggests there may be less economic slack and, accordingly, more underlying inflationary pressures, than commonly thought across&amp;nbsp;Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results highlight a risk to our forecasts and those by others that inflation will fall steadily next year. Other wild cards include a de-anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations, or a much sharper acceleration in wages that would trigger an adverse feedback loop between prices and&amp;nbsp;wages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of commentators have been predicting mean reversion in terms of returns to labour as a factor of production. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s really going to&amp;nbsp;happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Worth&amp;nbsp;following&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weak &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISM&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PMI&lt;/span&gt; data, indicating a recession, were ignored in favour of good &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JOLTS&lt;/span&gt; data, which has pushed up the expectations for further tightening. The peak seems to be around Mar next year, at 5.325%, which you can infer from the Eurdollar futures&amp;nbsp;curve. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTI&lt;/span&gt; was strong, because of strong demand and a big &amp;#8216;draw&amp;#8217;. See &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZH&lt;/span&gt; for more detail:&amp;nbsp;https://www.zerohedge.com/energy/wti-holds-gains-after-big-unexpected-crude-draw&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ZH&lt;/span&gt; had an odd&amp;nbsp;story: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one weird headline today (that sparked consternation among many Fed watchers) as White House economic advisor was interviewed on Bloomberg &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; and told the anchor that &amp;#8220;President Biden has endorsed The Fed&amp;#8217;s policy pivot.&amp;#8221; Did Bernstein just front-run tomorrow&amp;#8217;s announcement? How does Bernstein know that Powell is pivoting given that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOMC&lt;/span&gt; meeting just started? Is Bernstein explicitly signalling to pressure Powell and the independent Fed to&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8216;pivot&amp;#8217;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, none of the above, Bloomberg headline writers &amp;#8216;corrected&amp;#8217; their report to note that Bernstein was merely confirming that Biden endorsed The Fed&amp;#8217;s pivot to tightening this year. Pretty big difference there,&amp;nbsp;Bloomberg!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Brazilian Real did very well, on a daily move basis, presumably relieved that the election was over and everyone (except Bolsonaro himself) seems to accept that Lula has&amp;nbsp;won.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Image&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Alex Prager" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FggHpHLWQAAvQZ0?format=jpg&amp;amp;name=900x900"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where will interest rates go&amp;nbsp;next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;An ageing planet and the future path of interest&amp;nbsp;rates&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2022/10/05/elderly-populations-mean-more-government-spending"&gt;The Economist has a special report about ageing societies and mounting public sector&amp;nbsp;debt.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s hard to summarize fully, but the argument is that it&amp;#8217;s hard for governments to contain spending when their populations are ageing and demand more pensions and health benefits, but produce very little and therefore do not contribute much in taxes (certainly net of what they&amp;nbsp;receive).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, ageing populations have been able to get away with this by lending to younger countries to allow their growing populations to combine with a growing capital stock to boost the world&amp;#8217;s output (especially of tradeable goods). Sadly, that doesn&amp;#8217;t work if all countries are getting old together, and the big one, China, is well down that path. A path which, surely, Xi Jin Ping will fail to block off, in spite of his attempts to make citizens produce more&amp;nbsp;children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion is that interest rates are going up. Of course, demographics is only one of many reasons for this. It&amp;#8217;s seems impossible to think they won&amp;#8217;t and yet this has been true for a long time, and long-term yields are still very&amp;nbsp;low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion many people drew from the experience of the last 40 years of fixed income markets was that central banks had finally found a way to tame inflation and could always be relied on to prevent another 80s style inflation (or emerging market style hyperinflation, of the sort that we regularly see in Latin America and Africa).  This is explained in various ways, but a favourite approach is to invoke the &amp;#8216;safe asset shortage&amp;#8217; hypothesis. There are numerous papers on this, but I found &lt;a href="[The MOST Important Fundamental: The Global Shortage of Safe Assets | Macro Ops: Unparalleled Investing Research (macro-ops.com)](https://macro-ops.com/the-most-important-fundamental-the-global-shortage-of-safe-assets/)"&gt;this explainer&lt;/a&gt; a good explanation on my level. The idea is that, in the real world, savings flow from emerging markets to developed markets, even though you&amp;#8217;d think the demand for capital would be the other way around (because labour, the complementary factor of production to capital, is relatively abundant in emerging&amp;nbsp;economies). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it&amp;#8217;s not really a theory, it&amp;#8217;s just an empirical observation, or really a conundrum. Clearly, the legal and political frameworks in many developing countries do not put property rights at the heart of everything as they do in the West, and so the wealthy in those countries much prefer to put their savings in London houses than Zimbabwean&amp;nbsp;factories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not think that this will reverse very soon, but China, the elephant in the room, does not export much capital now, and with the pandemic and raging inflation everywhere maybe it will not be the only country to suddenly stop running  a trade surplus. I think this is true of Japan now too.
Of course, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; does run a large trade deficit, which it needs to balance by exporting a lot of capital, but it seems to me that it can only do this if it starts to offer some juicy returns, especially if &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GBP&lt;/span&gt; continues its downward trajectory against more or less every other&amp;nbsp;currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;#8217;m bearish on bonds, but I have been for a long time, and I&amp;#8217;m still waiting for the market to catch up with my way of&amp;nbsp;thinking.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Halloween Horror, Chinese Style</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/halloween-horror-chinese-style.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-10-31T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-03-23T13:24:54+00:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2022-10-31:/halloween-horror-chinese-style.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Scary&amp;nbsp;Stuff&lt;/h2&gt;

Insanely, investment in real estate in China is running at over 18% of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;. Much of it is financed by banks, which are behemoths, but running on tiny sliver of equity. 
The slightest pause in the price of real estate would make 2008 look like a tea party.
Supposedly, China has 30 years of inventory waiting to be&amp;nbsp;occupied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve listened to several presentations by Gavekal talking about how cheap China assets are, and how it is the future. With the place now run by a mad autocrat, and an economy based on a tottering tower of debt and empty real estate, I think it&amp;#8217;s eye-wateringly expensive.
With rich Chinese bailing out and converting as much wealth as possible into a form where Xi Jin-Ping cannot get his hands on it, the prospects for China seem very bad&amp;nbsp;indeed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CCP&lt;/span&gt; provides hidden subsidy, in the form of cheap loans and free infrastructure and tax breaks to manufacturers who export, so it will be hard to break our addiction in the West to cheap Chinese products, but if Xi continues to kill the Uigers, repress the population of   &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HK&lt;/span&gt;, and invade Taiwan, I think we might have&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The market as I see&amp;nbsp;it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central banks are going to take that bloody punchbowl away again.
The Fed is expected to hike 75bp, and the BoE the same.
Headline inflation is high, but falling surely. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RBA&lt;/span&gt; (tomrrow) is expected to hike just 25bp, so maybe this is the start of the&amp;nbsp;end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed income yields were up across the curve, but with a slightly flattening tilt.
At settlement, 2s +8.1bps at 4.503%, 3s +7.4bps at 4.463%, 5s +7.4bps at 4.262%, 7s +7.2bps at 4.177%, 10s +7.5bps at 4.085%, 20s +5.5bps at 4.444%, 30s +6.7bps at 4.196%. (data from&amp;nbsp;Newsquawk).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil was down $1.37 a barrel on the expectation of further Chinese weakness and a stronger&amp;nbsp;dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities were down in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, but up in Europe, presumably again influenced by the dollar. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DXY&lt;/span&gt; went as high as 111.67 before sagging a&amp;nbsp;bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt; was mainly about the dollar, but the Yen was particularly&amp;nbsp;weak.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>Tough Trudeau</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/tough-trudeau.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-10-29T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2022-11-22T20:22:54+00:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2022-10-29:/tough-trudeau.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;2022-10-29&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk didn&amp;#8217;t pull out. He now has a new baby, Twitter, which is de-listed and privately held.
I love the service, and I am utterly dismayed by the idea of it being controlled by a criminal mastermind, but I guess there are synergies in being a stockprice manipulator and owning the stockprice manipulation machine.
I had better not express opinions like that on Twitter again though, as it&amp;#8217;s only my lack of followers that has allowed my views to be relatively uncensored in the past.
(I was suspended for quite a while, but somehow I served my time and was released from Twitter jail. I still have no idea what the offending tweet&amp;nbsp;was.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LDI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems logical that funds should match their liabilities to their assets. 
Pension funds have long-dated cashflows as liabilities, and to match them with assets which provide a certainly of paying out they have to buy long bonds.
But those bonds are driven up in price, because they are competing with central banks which are hoovering up long dated treasuries in the pointless exercise known as quantitative&amp;nbsp;easing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who are responsible for managing these funds match the liabilities with (e.g.) gilt futures, and then use the cash they have left over to invest in more &amp;#8230; exciting assets, such as equities, private equity, venture capital, hedge funds &amp;#8230; well &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, crypto!
This is all fine unless gilts drop in value. 
In theory, there is no problem with this. 
The liabilities drop in value in a matching way.
But in practice, it&amp;#8217;s a disaster, because the funds get margin called.
If you don&amp;#8217;t know what a margin call is, lucky you! It&amp;#8217;s not nice. 
But, at least if you&amp;#8217;re a big fund, you can call the Bank of England and it will bale you out, by buying more gilts and pushing the price back up.
&amp;#8220;That sounds like blatant market manipulation,&amp;#8221; you say. &amp;#8220;Surely, that&amp;#8217;s illegal,&amp;#8221; you think. Well, it is unless the Bank does it, when it becomes perfectly &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it&amp;#8217;s a mess, and the market has absorbed the fact that whenever anything which is on the asset side of a bank&amp;#8217;s balance sheet goes down in value, the government, or an entity close to it, like the central bank, will ride to the&amp;nbsp;rescue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank is supposed to be doing &amp;#8216;quantitative tightening,&amp;#8217; which is basically the opposite of what it did the other week. Well, maybe it will, be now we all know that it will do a U-turn if the gilts market starts to look wobbly, which essentially defeats the whole purpose of the exercise. I&amp;#8217;m so glad the Bank is run by such clever&amp;nbsp;folk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lending money to someone for thirty years is a lot riskier than lending to them for one year, or even for five years.
The market&amp;#8217;s price of risk is an interest rate premium. Lending to me is a lot riskier than lending to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HM&lt;/span&gt; Treasury, so I pay a higher rate of interest. 
You would have thought that even with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Treasury lenders would demand a higher rate to lend for 30 years than for five, but in fact that is not always the case, as the chart shows.
When lending long-term, the biggest risk for the lender is inflation, which will kill real returns.
With inflation at 10%, a yield of 4.5% means that every year one&amp;#8217;s asset is wasting away by 5.5%.
In fact, since April 2021 the premium has evaporated to the point that today it&amp;#8217;s zero. 
In recent years, this spread has almost never got lower than -60bp. 
With inflation getting entrenched, it seems logical that the 30-year rate will start to outpace the 5-year one, but these are odd times, and if the Fed starts buying long-dated Treasuries again, all bets are&amp;nbsp;off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Economist&amp;#8217;s verdict on Sunak:&amp;nbsp;miss&lt;/h2&gt;

This is the verdict of the Economist.
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; is in a sorry state, and it&amp;#8217;s verdict is that Sunak is not the guy to lead us out of it. 
I am sure he&amp;#8217;s very clever, but all the evidence of recent elections is that academic intelligence can be a handicap in politics, as it alienates the candidate from the mass of voters, especially when it is coupled with a lack of empathy, which may be another of Sunak&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s also worrying that Sunak has been so keen on stupid ideas, such as freeports, Brexit and &amp;#8216;Eat Out to Help Out&amp;#8217; as well as supporting Boris Johnson in his challenge to Theresa May in&amp;nbsp;2017.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry><entry><title>A new day, a new UK PM</title><link href="https://www.stevehemingway.com/a-new-day-a-new-uk-pm.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-10-25T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2022-11-22T20:22:54+00:00</updated><author><name>steve</name></author><id>tag:www.stevehemingway.com,2022-10-25:/a-new-day-a-new-uk-pm.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;2022-10-25&lt;/h1&gt;

He has not been battle-hardened in the ways of Westminster, and plenty on his own side, not to mention the other, would be delighted to see him fail. 
He is probably not terribly well known to the British public. 
I cannot see most of them warming very rapidly to a billionaire Wykhamist hedge-fund boss who has spent most of his professional life on the west coast of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;.
He has recently spent £100K on a swimming pool, allegedly.
I don&amp;#8217;t begrudge him the right to spend time with his money, but stories of his wealth will dog him wherever he goes, generating resentment amongst even his supporters. 
How he deals with this will be a serious test of his electability. 
As a politician, one is not allowed to have perfectly normal and justifiable reactions to people being mean to&amp;nbsp;one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we will see how he copes with his new&amp;nbsp;role. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll do this for the week. Generally, things have been risk&amp;nbsp;off:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bond yields are generally down, in developed&amp;nbsp;markets,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in spite of the miserable news about Xi appointing himself dictator for life, and surrounding him with cronies, commodities are generally up, if only a teeny&amp;nbsp;bit,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;practically all developed stock markets in N. America and Europe are up, by a couple of percent on the&amp;nbsp;week,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the dollar has been struggling to make headway. I am sure this has been the main impetus for stocks and&amp;nbsp;commodities,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;crypto is also up. It&amp;#8217;s like stocks, but with a beta of ~2, so this is to be expected.
The big stories, as far as I can see&amp;nbsp;were:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; has a new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt;, who is a finance guy, so gilts are strong, for the&amp;nbsp;moment,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Dems will probably lose the HoR, but no more heavily than was expected months&amp;nbsp;ago,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biden is selling the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPR&lt;/span&gt; furiously, to bring down the price of gasoline, to improve the Dem&amp;#8217;s election prospects. Weak demand for China is helping him achieve&amp;nbsp;this,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ukraine war grinding on, Russia losing a lot of young able men who don&amp;#8217;t want to become cannon fodder in the freezing Ukraine&amp;nbsp;winter,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OPEC&lt;/span&gt;+ trying, and seemingly succeeding, in keeping oil at around&amp;nbsp;$85/barrel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thought&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Simple&amp;nbsp;models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple models help humans reason about the world. Complex models may come up with the right answers, but only if the parameters are known fully. Economics is a tough social science because, well, herd behaviour is not always&amp;nbsp;rational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two models which have been used a lot are Krugman&amp;#8217;s Washington &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt; babysitting co-op and Warren Mosler&amp;#8217;s business-card currency model. I&amp;#8217;m not joking &lt;a href="https://www.economicthought.net/blog/2014/03/babysitting-co-op-crises-and-money/"&gt;here is an article on the co-op&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4150619-extending-warren-moslers-business-card-economy"&gt;here is an article on the business card money&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although these models are relatively simple, they are still too complicated to introduce into a political debate about what the right course of action to take on the economy. 
Like all models, they leave a lot out, and will never be true except in a limited subset of real-world economic&amp;nbsp;states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that they shape the arguments of commentators, especially ones like Martin Wolf of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FT&lt;/span&gt; and Paul Krugman of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NY&lt;/span&gt; Times. So these models, not even mentioned in their columns, shape their thinking and, in turn, the thinking of advisors and politicians who are aligned with their general political positioning. (You don&amp;#8217;t get to be a successful columnist unless you give your regular readership what they want, and what they want is to have their view of the world confirmed as&amp;nbsp;correct.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure I am as subject to the baleful influence of oversimplified models as the next blogger. My early enthusiasm for Friedman was informed by the simplicity of his view of the world, compared to the rather more complex and convoluted view of&amp;nbsp;Keynes.&lt;/p&gt;

Budget deficits are huge now, compared to then, as a proportion of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt;. 
With many countries having debt to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDP&lt;/span&gt; in excess of 100%, it&amp;#8217;s hard to see how any politician can tolerate another Volker at the Fed, and doubly so in countries like the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;. 
My guess is that we get a Havenstein Moment, and yields go to&amp;nbsp;infinity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty dull really. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;amp;T jumped 7.7%, but otherwise the indexes were down by a fraction of a percent.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOMC&lt;/span&gt; voting member (for 2023) Harker made some sort of statement that he expected the Fed Funds to be well over 4% next year.

&lt;h2&gt;Kuppy on Liz Truss and &amp;#8216;Project&amp;nbsp;Zimbabwe&amp;#8217;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;@Kuppy bangs on about &amp;#8216;Project Zimbabwe:&amp;#8217; the plan to turn the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; into an emerging market by debasing its currency (and generally undermining the institutions which support capitalism there). 
&lt;a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2022/10/16/are-dms-now-ems/"&gt;He writes about&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, and how a few mis-steps by our glorious &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt; has destabilized the gilts market.
Truss now has gone into a padded cell and the government is being run by a technocrat who will make sure the market gods are appeased, but we sure had a wobbly few&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Income and substitution effects on supply of&amp;nbsp;labour&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labour is a funny thing. Working fewer hours gives the possibility of more consumption of leisure, which is a &amp;#8216;normal&amp;#8217; good: as we consume less, the marginal value increases. There will come a point when the value of an extra hour of work, in terms of net wages, will exactly offset the (lost) value of one fewer hour of leisure, and, in aggregate, the supply and demand for labour come into balance. 
As wages go up, the labour supply increases, as they go down, the labour supply&amp;nbsp;decreases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can lead to a situation where initial wages rises increase the supply of labour but beyond a certain point the increased wage results in the supply drying up. Surely we are in this latter regime when it comes to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; consultants now, many of whom are cutting their hours and even taking early retirement.  I suspect that it also applies to GPs who are&amp;nbsp;partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There must be an affect too, when both partners in a marriage are highly paid. A huge proportion of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHS&lt;/span&gt; GPs work part time now. The situation is complicated, not least because for many types of work there is no flexibility in number of hours worked. There are not many part-time &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FX&lt;/span&gt; dealers employed on the&amp;nbsp;planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not yet the close, but as things are going the big movers were:
- Biden ordered further sales from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPR&lt;/span&gt; to try to bring crude down, but it spiked 3.9% anyway, as traders bet on the headwinds from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OPEC&lt;/span&gt;+ production quotas dropping overwhelming the sales. The mid-terms are the emergency which has lead to this desperate action. I heard that the reserve was down over 40% from full capacity, which is a lot of oil to buy to replenish the stock.
- The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; govt. continues in meltdown, but somehow gilts keep going up, even though inflation is now printing at above 10%. More or less all other bonds continued to fall,
- Equities are looking moderately&amp;nbsp;nauseous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;German economic&amp;nbsp;miracle?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelykeion.com/middlestanding-together/?ref=Lykeion-newsletter"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; makes the case that a few very specific and time-limited factors helped Germany enormously, but these are all running out now. I guess this is a suggestion to short the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DAX&lt;/span&gt;, but I&amp;#8217;m not saying you should, and nor is the&amp;nbsp;author.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Markets"></category></entry></feed>
