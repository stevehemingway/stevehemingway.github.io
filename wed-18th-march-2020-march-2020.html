</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h2>10:53</h2>
<p>Early indications (Twitter) suggested that equity markets were going to open down, so you sold <span class="caps">ESTX50</span> <span class="amp">&amp;</span> <span class="caps">NQ</span>. <span class="caps">UB</span> was hit hard, and you sold an extra lot. <span class="caps">UB</span> is very long duration and very volatile, so it&#8217;s uncomfortable. You sold <span class="caps">BTP</span> too, which seems a &#8216;safe&#8217; bet&nbsp;(haha!).</p>
<p><span class="caps">TWS</span> warnings about orders on near-term futures so you rolled over all futures to next month. Affected: <span class="caps">DJ600</span>, <span class="caps">FTMIB</span>, <span class="caps">NQ</span>, <span class="caps">RDXUSD</span>.</p>
<p>Later your profits zoomed up to $100K. Markets retraced, causing <span class="caps">GBL</span> and R to be stopped out. I am not sure what market will be most affected by inflation, but maybe <span class="caps">GBL</span> is not the one, because Germany has such a strong balance sheet, and maybe not R because the <span class="caps">UK</span> has such a weak currency that maybe it will strengthen, squeching inflation. <span class="caps">TBH</span>, I&#8217;m grasping at straws, but inflation is going to pop up&nbsp;somewhere.</p>
<h2>11:40</h2>
<p><span class="caps">DJ600</span> and <span class="caps">FTMIB</span> stopped out. Slight&nbsp;loss.</p>
<h2>15:03</h2>
<p><span class="caps">US</span> open was intersting. Stocks and bonds continue to&nbsp;fall.</p>
<p>Stopped out: <span class="caps">NQ</span>, <span class="caps">JNK</span>, <span class="caps">NIO</span>, <span class="caps">VCLT</span>, <span class="caps">BTP</span>. All bar the last at a profit. Trailing stops are working for you, even though you are typically putting a 2-3% range on&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Purchased more puts on <span class="caps">TSLA</span> and <span class="caps">MU</span>. Both continue to&nbsp;sag.</p>
<p><span class="caps">GLRE</span> closed out at a slight loss. Presumably worries about claims wipe out attractiveness of the fund&nbsp;management.</p>
<p>15:06: you are now up 11%. You have $1.1M &#8216;excess liquidity&#8217; but that&#8217;s still pretty dangerous at only 2x maintenance&nbsp;margin.</p>
<h2>15:39</h2>
<p>Bought a bit of <span class="caps">AEM</span> (gold miner), <span class="caps">AAPL</span> puts (too expensive), <span class="caps">BTP</span> stopped out at a painful loss. Currently up 12.8%. Stimulus Phase 3 bill (billions for everyone) not having the desired pumping&nbsp;effect.</p>
<p>You are now running with a margin requirement of $600K. This is 2.5 times what it was a few weeks ago. You need to scale it back, even with your stops. It&#8217;s very hard to cut back positions when seeing daily returns of 12% though. Fear and greed, bears and bulls fight out for&nbsp;supremacy.</p>
<h2>18:13</h2>
<p>(Hopefully, my last batch of trades for the&nbsp;day.)</p>
<p><span class="caps">GC</span> stopped out: biggish loss, all commodities are being dragged down by the dash for cash, including gold. Same for <span class="caps">FTMIB</span>: can&#8217;t get this right. Every other stock index future is&nbsp;crashing.</p>
<p>In spite of wanting to pare back risk, in fact greed got the better of me and I increased risk in the&nbsp;following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Puts on <span class="caps">FXI</span>, <span class="caps">BA</span>, <span class="caps">TSLA</span>, <span class="caps">CHWY</span>, <span class="caps">CLX</span> (last because it is the only stock going&nbsp;up!!)</li>
<li><span class="caps">CFD</span> on <span class="caps">AEM</span>: gold miner that has been hammered. Small position&nbsp;only.</li>
</ul>
<p>As at 18:16 I am up&nbsp;22.16%.</p>
