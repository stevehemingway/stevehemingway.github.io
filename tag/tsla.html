<p>After the fireworks last week, nothing seems to be stirring.
Gilt yields are up a bit, the <span class="caps">FTSE</span> ($Z) is up 1.5% currently, with average volume.
$<span class="caps">ESTX50</span> too. 
Soybean futures are up.
Precious metals seem to be down.
Oil is down.
The dollar is up a tiny bit.
This info is probably purely noise, given that the <span class="caps">US</span> markets are closed today.
Generally, daily moves are mainly noise, of&nbsp;course.</p>
<h1>Crumbs</h1>
<p><a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/09/04/tesla-tragically-not-added-to-sp-500-shares-plunge-afterhours-triple-wtf-chart-of-the-year-turns-into-sharp-spike/">A crack in the Tesla&nbsp;cult?</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.alt-m.org/2020/09/03/the-feds-new-policy-rule-taylor-v-semi-wicksell/">Replacing the Taylor Rule</a>. 
Nominal <span class="caps">GDP</span> Level targeting has always seemed a better bet, but the &#8220;Semi-Wicksell Rule&#8221; is not far from this.
I find it frankly baffling that when <span class="caps">CB</span>&#8217;s talk about using an autonomous regime for interest rates, the formula includes totally unobservable numbers, such as r* (the &#8220;neutral real interest rate&#8221;). 
Years ago, there was a lot of focus on the <span class="caps">NAIRU</span> &#8212; the &#8220;Non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment.&#8221; 
I guess this is because the idea that technocrats would actually have a say on something so politically important is a&nbsp;fantasy.</p>
<h1>Close</h1>
<p>Well, nothing much happened today, as expected.
I read a few chapters of &#8220;Fooled by Randomness&#8221; by N N Taleb. 
It&#8217;s a real pity that the guy has such an obnoxious personality, because actually some of the stuff he writes makes a lot of sense. If only he did not write as if his understanding of all this stuff was two standard deviations above the rest of the planet. It&#8217;s not exactly an original thought that a distribution can have an average which is very different from the most probable value. When I was about 14 my maths teacher asked the class what the average number of legs you could expect of the world&#8217;s population of humans. It didn&#8217;t take us long to arrive at the conclusion that it was slightly below two, even though no human actually had 1.9999&#8230;&nbsp;legs.</p>                </article>
