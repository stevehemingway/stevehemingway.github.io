</footer><!-- /.post-info --><h1><span class="caps">ACB</span>&nbsp;Confirmed</h1>
<p>Amy Coney Barrett is now a <span class="caps">SCOTUS</span> judge. 
I don&#8217;t suppose she&#8217;ll be quite as bad as the progressives fear, but it&#8217;s depressing that the judicial pillar is so heavility politicized in the <span class="caps">US</span>.
The root case is the extent to which power is concentrated in the hands of the&nbsp;state.</p>
<h1>Markets</h1>
<p>After a fairly violent risk off day yesterday, the markets are pretty flat or up.
I assume this will continue until so new massive stimulus package is announced, which might not be until after the election.
Interestingly, 10 year yields continue to&nbsp;increase.</p>
<h1>Growth vs.&nbsp;Value</h1>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Growth&#8221; stocks have doubled in price, relative to &#8220;value&#8221; stocks over the last three years.
This has basically the worst relative performance in the last two hundred years, according to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fc7ce313-92f8-4f51-902b-f883afc1e035">the <span class="caps">FT</span></a> which is reporting on <a href="https://www.twocenturies.com/blog/2020/5/11/value-investing-even-deeper-history">a study done by Mikhail Samonov</a>.</p>
<p>The tentative conclusion is that over a long term, value investing gives good returns. 
Of course, this time might be&nbsp;different.</p>

<h1>Wrap</h1>
<p>I&#8217;m writing this before the <span class="caps">US</span> markets close, but it doesn&#8217;t look as though today will be very exciting.
Generally, it&#8217;s risk all over the place, with the mega caps doing better than the rest, with the <span class="caps">NQ</span> yet again green with the Dow and <span class="caps">SPX</span> red. $<span class="caps">NFLX</span> was down a bit. It seems to be running out of new&nbsp;customers.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">SAP</span> share price crashed yesterday by 20% on a forecast cut in revenues. This market is fragile.
Every newspaper is full of &#8220;Green&#8221; political initiatives. This will be a huge cost for future generations, 
incurred without any credible cost benefit&nbsp;case.</p>
<p>St James&#8217;s Place has been targetted by an activist investor.
The Hut Group share price has zoomed up 45% since the <span class="caps">IPO</span>. I remain a sceptic.
The Turkish Lira is sagging&nbsp;again.</p>                </article>
