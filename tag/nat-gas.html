<p>The <a href="http://creditbubblebulletin.blogspot.com/2020/08/weekly-commentary-moral-hazard-quagmire.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FvOLVyH+%28++Credit+Bubble+Bulletin%29">Credit Bubble Bulletin</a> is&nbsp;a </p>
<h2>Where has all the money&nbsp;gone?</h2>
<p>See <a href="https://twitter.com/iv_technicals/status/1297110841586835456">this thread</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EgBDVYwXgAAHNuB?format=png&name=900x900" width=800></p>
<p>The big question is &#8230; <em>why</em>?
Supplementary questions&nbsp;are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Japs did a lot of <span class="caps">QE</span>. Why hasn&#8217;t their stock market gone through the&nbsp;roof?</li>
<li>the stocks that have gone up had fortress balance sheets already, and would have done well whether or not the Fed had stepped in. In fact, their competitors might have been driven out of&nbsp;business. </li>
<li>can it really be Robinhood? The vast bulk of investment is via passive flows. Admittedly, there is no re-balancing with (market cap weighted) passive, but this goes for everything in the <span class="caps">SP</span>&nbsp;500.</li>
</ul>
<h2>It&#8217;s&nbsp;Saturday!</h2>
<p>The markets were closed today. 
It&#8217;s been a rough week.
My evening read today is <a href="https://www.bookfinder.com/search/?author=levy+&amp;title=mind+of+wall+street&amp;lang=en&amp;isbn=&amp;destination=gb&amp;currency=GBP&amp;mode=basic&amp;st=sr&amp;ac=qr">&#8220;The Mind of Wall Street&#8221;</a>. 
Unusually (for me), it&#8217;s hardcopy (but not hardback). If you&#8217;re local (well, say <span class="caps">UK</span>) and you&#8217;d like to read it drop me a line <span class="amp">&amp;</span> I&#8217;ll lend it to you for free. I will take a few days to read it. Initial chapters are very&nbsp;encouraging.</p>
<p>Good&nbsp;night!</p>
<h2>It&#8217;s now&nbsp;Sunday</h2>
<p>And I&#8217;m too lazy to create a new&nbsp;file. </p>
<p><a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/21/shells-new-12-17-billion-largest-ever-floating-facility-shut-down-months-after-shipping-first-lng-cargo-made-uneconomical-by-long-plunge-of-lng-prices/">This</a> caught my eye.
Trends can persist for a long time. Clearly, the top people at Shell felt that <span class="caps">NG</span> prices would be strong for a couple of decades after 2011. 
In fact, there has been a glut. 
The thesis that <span class="caps">NG</span> was a byproduct of oil, and so when oil demand collapsed because of Covid the price of <span class="caps">NG</span> would spike (thanks, Kuppy) has proved to be false. (Although, maybe it&#8217;s too early to say&#8230;)
Anyway, I keep an eye on <span class="caps">NG</span>, as I think it has potential as a fuel beyond the next decade,
but I&#8217;ve probably been too skeptical on green energy for a while, and the price may never recover.
I have no position in <span class="caps">NG</span>, nor am I ever likely to take one at this&nbsp;rate.</p>
<h2>Chasing Macro: Fiscal&nbsp;Edition</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MzxZu-KTrc">Episode 93</a> of <a href="https://markethuddle.com/">The Macro Huddle</a> was all about macro.
I listened to it in fragments, but my takeaways&nbsp;were:</p>
<ul>
<li>we&#8217;ve run out of road on monetary policy, and fiscal is coming down the&nbsp;road,</li>
<li>politics matters, and until the elections are over, there may be a pause in&nbsp;fiscal,</li>
<li>yield curve control is coming, and with it&nbsp;inflation,</li>
<li>the dollar is going down (or up, or flat: one of the&nbsp;above),</li>
<li>Natural Gas is probably going up: it&#8217;s hard to see anything taking its place: Biden promises a lot but probably won&#8217;t deliver, just like everyone thought that the new administration four years ago was going to do something about big pharma&#8217;s outrageous&nbsp;profits.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a lot of other stuff. Chase seems a cool guy. <a href="https://www.pineconemacro.com/white-mountain-letter.html">His newsletters</a> seem a good read and can&#8217;t be beaten on value for money (they are&nbsp;free!).</p>                </article>
