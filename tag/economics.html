</footer><!-- /.post-info --><h1>What links the <span class="caps">FAANG</span> to RobinHood and&nbsp;Tesla?</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4a439398-88ab-442a-9927-e743a3ff609b">This article</a> explains how RobinHood is able to offer retail investors commission-free stock trading. <a href="https://www.tradersmagazine.com/am/the-hidden-costs-of-robinhood/">This article</a> goes a bit further in suggesting that RobinHood is not really in the business of stealing from the rich to give to the poor, at least if you think of &#8220;the poor&#8221; as RobinHoods notional&nbsp;customers.</p>
<p>Almost the nearest thing that economics has to the Second Law of Thermodynamics is <em>There ain&#8217;t no such thing as a free lunch</em> or <span class="caps">TANSTAAFL</span> for short. 
In the case of RobinHood, as in the case of Facebook, the product is the &#8220;user.&#8221; The real customer is Citadel Securities, which gets to see the retail order flow and is free to write <span class="caps">AI</span> algorithms to monetize it or to &#8220;front run&#8221; it as we used to say in the good old days.
Of course, Citadel and the others who pay <span class="caps">RH</span> for order flow do not literally examine orders and place orders ahead of them. They simply use the real time data on where those leading the herd of retail investors are veering to next to make sure that they are on the right side of the&nbsp;trade.</p>
<p>Telsa, recently jilted at the altar by the committee of the S&amp;P500 inclusion committee is another case where the customer is seen and unseen. In Tesla&#8217;s case, a large part of its revenue is from companies like Fiat Chrysler Automotive, which does not make BEVs itself, but needs to include some in its notional product mix to satisfy <span class="caps">EU</span> regulators. By counting some Tesla cars as if they were made by Fiat, the latter gets off paying fines to the <span class="caps">EU</span>. 
In Tesla&#8217;s case, this is problematic, as these lucrative customers are about to go away, as every automotive manufacturer in Europe is churning out its own <span class="caps">BEV</span> range. This is all speculative, as the committee does not give its reasons. Tesla can now raise insanely cheap capital, so it has a big competitive advantage over legacy auto makers and might yet get in the index without opaque tax arbitrage payments from other automakers. We&#8217;ll&nbsp;see. </p>
<h1>Morning&nbsp;call</h1>
<p>Equities have calmed down after the euphoric bounce yesterday.
Bonds are dead.
Commodities are mixed but fairly flat.
Bitcoin ($<span class="caps">BRR</span> futures) is drifting down. I don&#8217;t see bitcoin as having any intrinsic value, 
but this makes its price a perfect measure of global sentiment. With no fundamentals to worry about, 
no yield to link its price to the movement of future interest rates, 
no trade balances or central bank issuance to worry about, it really has the characteristics of a perfect indicator.
With any luck it&#8217;ll be a leading indicator, although the &#8220;craze&#8221; aspect of it would not have helped in its early days. Hopefully, now, there is no novelty in bitcoin: it&#8217;s just a tradable commodity (albeit digital) that just reflects investor&#8217;s appetite for risk.
You can see it here, when I get around to finding an embeddable chart for&nbsp;it.</p>

<h1>Worth a&nbsp;look</h1>
<ul>

<p><a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/09/09/have-you-noticed-how-push-back-against-powell-feds-actions-is-getting-louder-in-the-mainstream-media-from-npr-to-cnbc/">Wolf on how J Powell responds to critics who say he&#8217;s exacerbating inequality</a>. <span class="caps">BTW</span>, it&#8217;s perfectly possible for the Fed&#8217;s actions to increase the chance of deflation and inflation, at the same time. The future of the economy has a distribution of outcomes, and more matters than just the mean (or the&nbsp;median!).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Druckenmiller&nbsp;says:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s an &#8220;absolute raging mania.&#8221; Hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller appeared on <span class="caps">CNBC</span> yesterday, warning of the mania in the markets caused by the Federal Reserve and saying it will end badly. &#8220;Everybody loves a party &#8230; but, inevitably, after a big party there&#8217;s a hangover,&#8221; Druckenmiller said. &#8220;Right now, we&#8217;re in an absolute raging mania. We&#8217;ve got commentators encouraging companies to do stock splits. Companies then go up 50%, 30%, 40% on stock splits. That brings no value, but the stocks go&nbsp;up.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Druckenmiller also said, as reported by Bloomberg and printed in the <span class="caps">FT</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Inflation could hit 5% to 10% in the next four to five years, Druckenmiller said Wednesday in a <span class="caps">CNBC</span> interview, adding that the Federal Reserve has created conditions that have sent valuations soaring. Deflation is also a risk, he&nbsp;said.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do we do about this? I wish I knew. It sounds as though Druck doesn&#8217;t&nbsp;either.</p>
<h1><span class="caps">US</span> Current&nbsp;Account</h1>
<p>This looks awkward for Trump, given his trade wars&nbsp;rhetoric. </p>

</div>

<h1>Wrap</h1>
<p>Written early, but so far the market looks becalmed. 
Equities practically flat, other markets fairly quiet. 
Not entirely consistent with the Druck quote above, but this thing is not over&nbsp;yet.</p>
<p>Written as the <span class="caps">US</span> closed: quite severe drops in <span class="caps">ES</span> and <span class="caps">GBP</span>. The latter because of the Brexit omnishambles, 
presumably.
Nearly all commodities down (wheat an exception, maybe).
<span class="caps">EM</span> currencies down. <span class="caps">DXY</span> up (of course).
Looks like a classic risk off day, except 10 year treasuries are not responding. 
We truly are turning&nbsp;Japanese.</p>
<p>Selgin on corridor and floor systems is very&nbsp;good.</p>                </article>

<p>The mysterious &#8220;velocity of money&#8221; is just <span class="caps">GDP</span> divided by the amount of money, in consistent units.
The following is created by looking at <span class="caps">GDP</span> and M2 (in real dollars). 
Velocity takes a dive before (and early during) recessions.
Maybe this time will be&nbsp;different.</p>
