<p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f7848873-ba42-4166-b063-fe6aa51e1080">John Plender argues that central bank action will
make treasuries and gilts (so called &#8220;safe assets&#8221;) less safe</a>, in that it will increase the correlation of 
their prices with those of corresponding equities. 
It&#8217;s not Plender&#8217;s finest work, but it shows how inflation fears are being reported on almost daily now 
in the mainstream media. 
I think that the <span class="caps">FT</span> should allow columnists never to update their photos. 
The new one of Plender is awful.
I&#8217;d prefer to think of his as never-changing old profile&nbsp;pic.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/business/inflation-worse-pandemic-coronavirus.html">An economics professor points out that for ordinary consumers prices are rising faster than official statistics</a>.
Again, this is a well documented phenomenon, but the volume of articles pointing it out has&nbsp;risen.</p>
<h1>Market&nbsp;report</h1>
<p>Markets getting more skittish. 
Sept. <span class="caps">VIX</span> future up around 29. Has been going up since around 27th Aug. It is twice the level of Feb.,
even though the market is higher and seemingly sailing on a millpond.
Bonds too have been going up (yields down) since then.
Gold has been basically going nowhere since this time (executed a &#8216;prarie dog&#8217; formation).
<span class="caps">LB</span> is on a clear downward path.
Food commods are pretty quiet, in spite of news of high food inflation in China.
There may be some complication about how China is disconnected to <span class="caps">US</span> commod. futures.
Copper down 1% to under $3/lb (<span class="caps">NYMEX</span>).</p>
<p>$<span class="caps">TLSA</span> is down about 7%. Maybe the Robinhood bagholders are starting to read up about stock splits and dilution.
Or maybe it&#8217;s just a cunning bear trap laid by Elon, who currently in Germany subsidy truffle&nbsp;hunting.</p>
<h1>Wrap</h1>
<p><span class="caps">NDX</span> (<span class="caps">NASDAQ</span>) down 5.2%. A healthy correction before a retrace tomorrow? The beginning of the end?
Who knows? Certainly not me! Global equity&nbsp;down.</p>
<p>Ten year yields of govt. bonds up across the board, except&nbsp;Germany.</p>
<p>Commodities down, including&nbsp;down.</p>
<p>There are not many places to hide. Currencies broadly&nbsp;unchanged.</p>
<h1>Thought for the&nbsp;day</h1>
<p>Wetherspoons have a great app, and are very busy locally to me.
A lot of the <em>bien pensants</em> sneer at this unpretentious value-for-money pub chain, 
not least because Tim Martin is so Brexity, but he has adapted to Covid-19 with characteristic efficiency and will see off more of his competition by the time this crisis is&nbsp;over.</p>                </article>
