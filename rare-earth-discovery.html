<h2>Not such rare&nbsp;earths!</h2>
<p><a href="https://news.metal.com/newscontent/101881567/Turkey-Discovers-694-million-mt-of-Rare-Earth-Element-Reserves-with-Infrastructure-Construction-Starting-This-Year/#.YsSw_-yrSbA.twitter">Turkey Discovers 694 million mt of Rare Earth Element Reserves, with Infrastructure Construction Starting This&nbsp;Year.</a></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how reliable this is, but if it is true, it sounds kinda important.
I haven&#8217;t seen this anywhere other than as a random tweet on&nbsp;Twitter.</p>
<h2>Nadhim al&nbsp;Zahawi</h2>
<p>This guy has some risk-taking abilities. Within hours of being appointed to the second most important post in government by Boris Johnson, he tells him (Johnson) that he must go.
I don&#8217;t know what the odds are, but if you get to the top by being ruthless, this guy has what it&nbsp;takes.</p>
<h2>Neocons and <span class="caps">US</span>&nbsp;Hegemony</h2>
<p>Jeffrey Sachs has written <a href="https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202207/02/WS62bfa7a1a310fd2b29e69ed8.html">this piece</a> that has been picked up in many publications.
It&#8217;s a rather personal attack on a number of individual (and now mainly very old) <span class="caps">US</span> neocons. 
It argues that the <span class="caps">US</span> is warlike and constantly strives to expand its global influence by getting involved in &#8216;wars of choice, such as Serbia (1999), Afghanistan (2001), Iraq (2003), Syria (2011) and Libya&nbsp;(2011).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really agree with this, but I&#8217;d like to see some sort of official denial of this as <span class="caps">US</span> policy.
Sachs argues that many of Biden&#8217;s key advisors are linked to a key group of 70&#8217;s&nbsp;neocons. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main message of the neocons is that the <span class="caps">US</span> must militarily dominate every region of the world, and must confront rising regional powers that could someday challenge <span class="caps">US</span> global or regional dominance, most importantly Russia and China. For this purpose, <span class="caps">US</span> military force should be pre-positioned in hundreds of military bases around the world and the <span class="caps">US</span> should be prepared to lead wars of choice as&nbsp;necessary.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Market&nbsp;Report</h2>
<p>From <span class="caps">SEB</span>. <a href="https://research.sebgroup.com/macro-ficc/reports/29009">First rate, and&nbsp;free.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stock markets in the <span class="caps">US</span> rose moderately yesterday and are followed today by markets in Asia except for Hong Kong&#8217;s Hang Seng index. The rise is driven by technology stocks, led by Samsung, following a report of stronger-than-expected revenue. <span class="caps">US</span> and European stock futures point to a stable opening with small movements later today. The <span class="caps">US</span> Fed published the minutes of the June meeting yesterday, which showed concern among members about rising inflation (more below). This led to a selloff in the bond market, albeit a limited one. At the time of writing, the <span class="caps">US</span> 10-year interest rate is 2.92% compared to 2.80% yesterday. The dollar strengthened and is approaching parity with the euro, although it has fallen back a bit today with <span class="caps">EUR</span>/<span class="caps">USD</span> at 1.02. Oil prices fell on concerns of declining demand in case of recession but are back over $ 100/barrel today. Rising covid cases in Shanghai also caused a drop in oil demand expectations, as well as signs that Russia has managed to redirect oil supplies to Asia. Discussions on how to limit Russia&#8217;s oil revenues continue without signs of a clear solution or concrete proposal on how to proceed. Despite the Norwegian government stopping the strike in the oil and gas sector, the price of natural gas continued to increase, driven by concerns about continued disruptions in supplies to the <span class="caps">EU</span> from&nbsp;Russia.</p>
<p>Hawkish Fed not entirely credible according to investors who see economic slowdown. The minutes from the Fed&#8217;s meeting on 14–15 June, which were released yesterday, showed that the members agreed that they must continue to raise the policy rate to prevent inflation from taking hold, even if it would mean that the economy slows down. Several members also said that they must act decisively so that the public does not doubt their intention to bring down inflation. The protocol indicates that more increases in the magnitude of 75 points are to be expected (more from Jussi Hiljanen here). However, the rise in the <span class="caps">US</span> stock markets yesterday was a sign that many investors believe that the protocol has already been overplayed as statistics since the June meeting pointed to a slowdown in demand that would help lower inflation even with a slight monetary tightening. The undersigned is sceptical. Given that the energy war between Russia and the <span class="caps">EU</span> is not over and given China&#8217;s continued zero tolerance for covid, inflation looks set to continue to rise for a while longer and who does not want to be compensated for that when wages&nbsp;come?</p>

<h2>Boris</h2>
<p>I saw on Twitter a comment along the lines of &#8220;Don&#8217;t think of it as the country losing a Prime Minister. Think about it as the country gaining a game show&nbsp;host.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Real rates still expected to be&nbsp;negative</h2>
<p><img alt="Deutsche Bank Research" src="https://thedailyshot.com/wp-content/uploads/US-Peak-real-FF-rate-will-be-negative2207070531.png">
Modern economies cannot tolerate savers receiving any real&nbsp;return.</p>
<h2>The&nbsp;yen</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0556df06-e2ba-4e88-8be3-d210e88d56db"><span class="caps">JP</span> Morgan (writing in the <span class="caps">FT</span>) considers the yen to be still overvalued.</a>
The arguments&nbsp;are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the carry trade is dead&nbsp;now,</li>
<li>Japan now barely has a current account surplus, since it offshored all its&nbsp;manufacturing,</li>
<li>the BoJ is hell-bent on yield curve control, which will prevent them tightening in the way that other central banks are&nbsp;doing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The counter argument is that most Jap debt is owned by Japs, so the currency is a safe haven,
and that asset prices in Japan are cheap, so re-pricing should increase demand for&nbsp;yen.</p>
<p>Exchange rates. Anyone&#8217;s guess. Who would have guessed that total chaos in the <span class="caps">UK</span> government, the vastly increased chance of an early election and a socialist party victory would have been positive for&nbsp;sterling!</p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>Today was a boring, textbook risk on day.
All real assets up, silver being an exception, just.
Oil bouncing back 4.3%.
All indexes up, Nasdaq by 2.13%.
<span class="caps">VIX</span> down.
Bonds all&nbsp;down.</p>
<h2>Twitter</h2>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about the gold market, but gold bugs have been convinced that the market has been manipulated for&nbsp;years.</p>
