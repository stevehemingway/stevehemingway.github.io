<ul>
<li><span class="caps">US</span> real estate is motoring. Builders of low-end homes have done incredibly well. There is a high level of household formation, and this has resulted in share price increases of up to 74% ($<span class="caps">CCS</span> &#8212; Century Communities).  This must be, at least in part, down to the availability of credit. The big national housebuilders (e.g. <span class="caps">DR</span> Horton, $<span class="caps">DHI</span>) have risen 36%. This fits in with timber prices going through the roof (as well as holding it up). The big player here is $<span class="caps">WY</span>, Weyerhaeuser. There is a mass of detail <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4374843-timber-reits-literally-on-fire">here</a> but my takeaway is that housing and timber will continue to enjoy positive returns next&nbsp;year.</li>
<li>Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) have had a rough decade. Their governance is often terrible. There is some evidence that this is being sorted out. $<span class="caps">ET</span> (Energy Transfer) seems a good choice. More details <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4396627-energy-transfer-get-paid-9_8-yield-while-deleveraging-story-plays-out">here</a>.</li>
<li>My instinct is that nat. gas is going up, but the commodity is so volatile I&#8217;m keeping away at the&nbsp;moment.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.chinabeigebook.com/">this</a> is supposed to argue that Chinese stats. this year are even more fabricated than usual. For sure &#8230; but stonks just to up. Investing in China is for the very&nbsp;brave.</li>
<li>$<span class="caps">ARKK</span> is now starting to fall. Maybe Crazy Cathy is crazy after&nbsp;all,</li>
<li>
<p>The Russell is faltering,
<img alt="img" src="https://tme2.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/fcae59d487d3704c6642ceaff31fa309"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As unemployment rises, the job losses are almost 100% concentrated in that part of the population with the lowest educational attainment. Our rulers might know this, but they do not understand it as someone who left school at 16 with no qualifications does. It&#8217;s obvious, but it&#8217;s also <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/de643f89-5be8-4344-81ac-78c7026e9bfe">here</a>,</p>
</li>
<li>junk bonds will falter. They just&nbsp;will.</li>
<li>M1 money stock is rising at an unprecedented rate. Correspondingly, since the <span class="caps">US</span> is not experiencing any kind of economic growth, velocity is cratering. But the money stock will be difficult to get back into the bottle, and the stimulus checks (any advance on $2,000) are &#8212; surely &#8212; going to trigger some kind of pickup in demand, even if they are spent only by the people who don&#8217;t really need them.

<h1>Wrap</h1>
<p><span class="caps">US</span> <span class="amp">&amp;</span> <span class="caps">FE</span> equities mostly up, European equities down. 
Bonds globally flat.
Commodities: mainly up, following crude. Industrial metals down, gold up.
Dollar down (now <span class="caps">DXY</span> standing at 89.63).
Generally risk-on, but&nbsp;muted.</p>
<p>Drivers: who knows, but probably vaccine hopes.
Japan may have benefited  from a few stories concerning shareholder activism. I think the main one concerned Toshiba, whose management has been destroying shareholder value for a long&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is into the stratosphere. Tesla is up quite a bit. 
These two bits of vapourware show that a good story and sufficiently strong investor sentiment can keep an asset going up for literally years beyond the point where anyone concerned about value has got&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>$<span class="caps">PAAS</span> (silver miner) is experiencing violent&nbsp;volatility.</p>
