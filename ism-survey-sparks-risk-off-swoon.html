<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>The markets got totally spooked by a range of <span class="caps">ISM</span> reports today.
The services index came in very weak, compared to recent months, which I would have though would have been expected. Labour costs were expected to rise, suggesting that labour shortages were the problem. 
For me, this points to inflation, but the &#8216;weaker growth&#8217; narrative dominated and yields fell further across the board. 
The weighted <span class="caps">US</span> <span class="caps">ISM</span> survey for manufacturing and services fell from a recent high of 14% to 5%. 
Presumably the weighting is by contribution to <span class="caps">GDP</span> in which case these figures will be mainly services activity. I these are &#8220;diffusion indexes,&#8221; which are based on asking purchasing managers on their expectations of future economic activity. 
I don&#8217;t suppose these individuals have a crystal ball that is clearer than anyone&nbsp;else&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Anyway, the market seems to have taken the figures to heart and pivoted in the predictable deflationary direction. Nearly all equity indexes down, commodities down quite heavily, bond yields down, <span class="caps">USD</span> up. 
Exceptions are that the <span class="caps">VIX</span> was up a bit and the <span class="caps">NDX</span> eked out a gain, presumably in response to the idea that it&#8217;s a long-duration&nbsp;asset.</p>
<h2>Why is Japan like it&nbsp;is?</h2>
<p>Japan&#8217;s working-age population has been declining for decades. 
This will reduce demand, a bit. But a lot of those retirees are still consuming stuff.
Meanwhile, the labour supply is drying up.
Assuming the magnitude of the first effect is less than that of the second, surely this would result in increasing wage costs and inflation.
Obviously, I&#8217;m missing something, but&nbsp;what?</p>
<h2>China</h2>
<p>Something is pretty odd about China. Didi, which just IPOed in <span class="caps">NY</span>, suddenly got removed from the app store. I think this means that new drivers can&#8217;t sign up. But what it really means is that the Emperor Xi will not tolerate dissent.
How anyone can invest in equities in China is beyond me. 
I can see the appeal of sovereign local currency bonds, as it&#8217;s unlikely to default and current interest rates are bound to go down. 
<span class="caps">OK</span>, maybe they&#8217;ll go up for a while, but China has had its industrial revolution and is now following Japan down the path to deflationary despondency.  Well, that&#8217;s my view,&nbsp;obviously.</p>
<p>On the Didi fiasco, maybe the authorities were sending a signal &#8220;List in China, or else feel the effect of our wrath!&#8221; The stock is down 30% within days, and other China <span class="caps">US</span> issues are in&nbsp;doubt.</p>
