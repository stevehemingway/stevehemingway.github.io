      <title>Update on Blog Setup</title>
      <link>https://stevehemingway.github.io/posts/update_on_blog_setup/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Git submodules are still a bit of a mystery to me, but I yet again followed the instructions on &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/tutorials/github-pages-blog/&#34;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; and this time it kind of worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It finally dawned on me that git push and pull link a local work tree to a remote repository. You can&amp;rsquo;t run a web server on the remote machine, point it at the repository, and expect it to serve web pages, even though that&amp;rsquo;s what the repository (possibly) contains. Git gurus, stop rolling your eyes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t even checkout the repository on the local machine because then git push will complain that you&amp;rsquo;re pushing to a master branch that it active and checked out on the remote machine. I discovered that the hard way. My web server does run a git server process. I tried it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, after a bit of faffing around (!) I decided to edit the hugo source web file source on my local machine (running msys2 under Windows), push to github.com (because it is so awesome as a git server, and its free), then git pull the (built) website source from github to my web server directory on my dreamhost shared web server machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to add to my blog I create a markdown file, add it to the github pages repo, then git pull it to the dreamhost machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a slight added complication, I run the DNS for this domain on another machine - a digital ocean dropbox, running mail-in-a-box. I discover I have to look in the dreamhost control panel DNS settings for the domain to see what IP address to use for the A record. I can&amp;rsquo;t just use the main (arago) IP address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who would have thought that something so simple could be so &amp;hellip;. messy?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>March Newsletter</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NORTH HERTFORDSHIRE DISTRICT COUNCIL – MARCH UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the penultimate meeting of NHDC for the current civic year, the budget for &lt;sup&gt;2017&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; was agreed.  Further savings were identified, as well as a substantial programme of capital expenditure. The council faces challenging times ahead as it has to contend with dwindling revenues from the New Homes Bonus and from Business Rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The council&amp;rsquo;s focus is on making North Herts, in all its diversity, a better place for and working.  It aims to do this by working with partners to provide &amp;lsquo;an attractive and safe environment for our residents&amp;rsquo;. Currently, we are working towards a joint waste collection contract with East Herts District Council. Waste collection is not the most glamorous of activities, but it is the biggest item in the expenditure budget, accounting for 45% of the total!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The council has an objective &amp;lsquo; To promote sustainable growth within our district to ensure economic and social opportunities exist for our communities&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo;. The main driver of this is the Local Plan. It also includes a £1m Capital Enhancement Fund, for community halls throughout the District, to be delivered over the next four years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third and final objective is to &amp;lsquo;deliver cost effective and necessary services to our residents&amp;rsquo;.  Where these services are charged for at the point of use, such as for planning applications, the fees are also prescribed centrally. However, the council does operate a very successful Careline service. This award-winning service helps elderly and infirm residents to continue living at home. NHDC is also about to launch a building regulations inspection service and hopes that this will be a source of income. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, NHDC does not have a free hand in most of the services it provides. They are so-called &amp;lsquo;statutory services&amp;rsquo;, prescribed by the national government. In most cases these are free, for example waste collection. Where charges can be made (e.g. planning applications), the rates are set nationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the more controversial policies recently has been the one which applies to community halls owned by the council. The policy has been to lease these to local groups on a &amp;lsquo;repairing and insuring lease&amp;rsquo;. This has put some pressure on some local groups who find that it is difficult to adapt to paying for the costs of maintaining their premises. It does, however, put them on an equal footing with groups in parished areas, like Knebworth. Parishes, such as ours, have always had to bear these costs, especially now capital grants for village halls have largely dried up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, by now you&amp;rsquo;re probably wondering how much your council tax is going to go up in April. The NHDC precept for a Band D property will be £216.96 next year, an increase of £5, an increase of 2.4% in cash terms, close to zero in real terms. Not great, but as low as was reasonably achieveable in the circumstances.  (The rest of your Council Tax is made up of contributions to the County Council, the Police and the Parish Council.) For other Council Tax Bands, see the NHDC website, or just wait for your bill to be delivered.&lt;span id=&#34;header-c48&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Station_Pub</title>
      <link>https://stevehemingway.github.io/posts/StationPub/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Feb 2017 14:12:17 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://stevehemingway.github.io/posts/StationPub/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My experience of the Station Pub in Knebworth is not one that makes me want to go back. The pub is cold, noisy and rarely populated by anyone I know. This is a pity, as it&amp;rsquo;s a very short distance from where I live. A few months ago, word went out that it had been advertised for sale. There were a few discussions about it in the Parish Council, where we decided that we&amp;rsquo;d better apply for it to be listed as an asset of community value. Planning applications to develop a very high density development of flats have been received for the site across the road, which have so far been refused, but eventually will result in some residential development happening. In spite of the fact that this is not something that anyone who lives in the village want to see built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, heard that the pub had closed its doors, and the staff had been redeployed in other Greene King pubs nearby. A flurry of activity happened, which resulted in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a new Twitter account was set up to tweet the latest news about the pub,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a new Facebook being set up that rapidly went from zero to around 600 members by the end of the weekend,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a new website being created, which has received hundreds of hits,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a mailing list being set up to collect pledges and offers to help with a campaign.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the website &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stationpub.org.uk&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, where you&amp;rsquo;ll find links to all the aspects of the campaign&amp;rsquo;s web presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is quite astonishing is how rapidly the residents of Knebworth could be alerted to the closing of the pub and the existence of a campaign to save it. I have always been an advocate of local politicians using social media, usually in the face of extreme skepticism from the assembled company. Although I&amp;rsquo;d like to think that this example would persuade them of the effectiveness of the web, my experience is that people can be very obdurate in their views.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Community engagement using Facebook</title>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-station-pub-knebworth&#34;&gt;The Station Pub, Knebworth&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was contacted yesterday, in my capacity as ward councillor, about the closure of the Station Pub.
This is the only pub in the village, and, since it is right in the centre, was very visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommended creating a Facebook Group. I had a meeting, and someone else set up the group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I found that hundreds had already joined, and a further three hundred were queing up to join today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rate of joining this group was astonishing. I am now convinced that mailing lists are comprehensively obsoleted by Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people do not use FB, but the ease of adding someone to a group is so great that there is no other medium that can work so quickly. The problem is that this only works when the campaign is something that people are seriously affected by, or at least interested in. A cause that nobody cares about much will go nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Is Twitter the key Social Media Platform?</title>
      <link>https://stevehemingway.github.io/posts/Twitter/</link>

      <description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-experience-of-the-twittersphere&#34;&gt;My experience of the Twittersphere&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been on Twitter for a long time. Since 2007. From a time before Stephen Fry discovered the medium, and many years before Donald Trump did so. I&amp;rsquo;ve mainly used it passively. I kept my account private, and followed only those authors whose work interested me. A lot of libertarian comment and analysis, some humour, especially the dark side. I have a number of followers, but get virtually no engagement with them. They are either people I follow, and feel that it is only good manners to follow back, or people who somehow have the email address linked to the account in the address book they have handed over to Twitter Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I have never tweeted anything very incendiary, and do not follow anyone I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want my mother to know I was following, I decided that when I was elected I&amp;rsquo;d better start a new account for the political me. This happened in 2014, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been quietly tweeting since, without much traction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of late I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to integrate a bit more automation, using ifttt.com, and simply linking my Twitter account to a FB page. I&amp;rsquo;d previously auto tweeted from my Tumblr blog, but that never seemed to do any good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, for reasons quite beyond me, my follower numbers seem to be accelerating. The threat to close the Station Pub seems a catalyst. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just that my odd retweet is enough to create a sustaining wave. I confess to paying a magnificent £10 to promote one tweet, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing that again in a hurry, as there seems to be no way to localize the audience, in contrast to FB.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Post with a Background Image</title>
      <link>https://stevehemingway.github.io/techie_stuff/background-image/</link>

      <guid>https://stevehemingway.github.io/techie_stuff/background-image/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here be a sample post with a custom background image. To utilize this &amp;ldquo;feature&amp;rdquo; just add the following YAML to a post&amp;rsquo;s front matter.&lt;/p&gt;
background: /images/filename.png

&lt;p&gt;This little bit of YAML makes the assumption that your background image asset is in the &lt;code&gt;/images&lt;/code&gt; folder. If you place it somewhere else or are hotlinking from the web, just include the full http(s):// URL. Either way you should have a background image that is tiled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to set a background image for the entire site just add &lt;code&gt;background: /images/filename.png&lt;/code&gt; as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/overview/configuration/#examples&#34;&gt;param&lt;/a&gt; in your config and BOOM &amp;mdash; background images on every page!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Syntax Highlighting Post</title>
      <link>https://stevehemingway.github.io/techie_stuff/code-highlighting-post/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Syntax highlighting is a feature that displays source code, in different colors and fonts according to the category of terms. This feature facilitates writing in a structured language such as a programming language or a markup language as both structures and syntax errors are visually distinct. Highlighting does not affect the meaning of the text itself; it is intended only for human readers.&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;highlighted-code-blocks&#34;&gt;Highlighted Code Blocks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To modify styling and highlight colors edit &lt;code&gt;/static/css/_sass/_syntax.scss&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
#container {

      <title>A Post with Images</title>
      <link>https://stevehemingway.github.io/techie_stuff/sample-post-images/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 May 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://stevehemingway.github.io/techie_stuff/sample-post-images/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of what a post with images might look like. If you want to display two or three images next to each other responsively use &lt;code&gt;figure&lt;/code&gt; with the appropriate &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt;. Each instance of &lt;code&gt;figure&lt;/code&gt; is auto-numbered and displayed in the caption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;figures-for-images-or-video&#34;&gt;Figures (for images or video)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;one-up&#34;&gt;One Up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;//farm9.staticflickr.com/8426/7758832526_cc8f681e48_b.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//farm9.staticflickr.com/8426/7758832526_cc8f681e48_c.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;//www.flickr.com/photos/80901381@N04/7758832526/&#34; title=&#34;Morning Fog Emerging From Trees by A Guy Taking Pictures, on Flickr&#34;&gt;Morning Fog Emerging From Trees by A Guy Taking Pictures, on Flickr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;two-up&#34;&gt;Two Up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apply the &lt;code&gt;half&lt;/code&gt; class like so to display two images side by side that share the same caption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;half&#34;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;https://stevehemingway.github.io/images/image-filename-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&#34;https://stevehemingway.github.io/images/image-filename-2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Caption describing these two images.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you&amp;rsquo;ll get something that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;half&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;//placehold.it/1200x600.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//placehold.it/600x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;//placehold.it/1200x600.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//placehold.it/600x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;//placehold.it/600x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;//placehold.it/600x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Two images.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;three-up&#34;&gt;Three Up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apply the &lt;code&gt;third&lt;/code&gt; class like so to display three images side by side that share the same caption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&#34;third&#34;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&#34;//placehold.it/1200x600.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//placehold.it/600x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;a href=&#34;//placehold.it/1200x600.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//placehold.it/600x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;a href=&#34;//placehold.it/1200x600.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//placehold.it/600x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;Caption describing these three images.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you&amp;rsquo;ll get something that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&#34;third&#34;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;//placehold.it/1200x600.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//placehold.it/600x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;//placehold.it/1200x600.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//placehold.it/600x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;//placehold.it/1200x600.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//placehold.it/600x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;//placehold.it/1200x600.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//placehold.it/600x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;//placehold.it/1200x600.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//placehold.it/600x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;//placehold.it/1200x600.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//placehold.it/600x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Three images.&lt;/figcaption&gt;

      <title>Theme Setup</title>
      <link>https://stevehemingway.github.io/techie_stuff/theme-setup/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://stevehemingway.github.io/techie_stuff/theme-setup/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;This is a port of the &lt;strong&gt;HPSTR&lt;/strong&gt; theme to &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. This theme is perfect for bloggers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;get-the-theme&#34;&gt;Get the theme&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Git installed, run the following commands inside the Hugo site folder. If Hugo has not yet been installed, read the setup guide &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/overview/installing/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ mkdir themes
$ cd themes
$ git clone https://github.com/dldx/hpstr-hugo-theme.git hpstr
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get a zip of the latest version of the theme from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dldx/hpstr-hugo-theme&#34;&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt; and extract it to the themes folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;setup&#34;&gt;Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, you need to configure your site and add some content. We provide a complete example site under the folder &lt;code&gt;exampleSite&lt;/code&gt;. All you need to do is copy the contents of that folder into the main hugo site folder so that it looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;hugo-website
├── config.toml
├── content
│   └── posts
├── data
├── static
│   ├── assets
│   │   ├── css
│   │   ├── fonts
│   │   └── js
│   │       ├── plugins
│   │       └── vendor
│   └── images
└── themes
    └── hpstr
        ├── archetypes
        ├── layouts
        │   ├── _default
        │   └── partials
        └── static
            ├── css
            │   └── _sass
            │       └── vendor
            │           ├── font-awesome
            │           └── magnific-popup
            ├── fonts
            └── js
                ├── plugins
                └── vendor

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should be enough to get a working website!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;running-hugo&#34;&gt;Running Hugo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To serve the site while you write posts, simply run &lt;code&gt;hugo server&lt;/code&gt; in the base folder. You can now edit and make new posts, which will show up instantly. To render a permanent site, run &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;configuration&#34;&gt;Configuration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;disqus-comments&#34;&gt;Disqus Comments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a &lt;a href=&#34;http://disqus.com&#34;&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt; account and change &lt;code&gt;disqusShortname&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; to the Disqus &lt;em&gt;shortname&lt;/em&gt; you just setup. By default comments appear on all post and pages if you assigned a shortname. Note that comments won&amp;rsquo;t generally load when you are running the server locally. To disable commenting on a post or page, add the following to its YAML Front Matter:&lt;/p&gt;
comments: false

&lt;h3 id=&#34;social-share-links&#34;&gt;Social Share Links&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To disable Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ share links on a post or page, add the following to its front matter:&lt;/p&gt;
share: false

&lt;h3 id=&#34;owner-author-information&#34;&gt;Owner/Author Information&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change your name, and avatar photo (200x200 pixels or larger), email, and social networking URLs in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add a copyright string to the footer, add &lt;code&gt;copyright = &amp;quot;(c) Blah&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;google-analytics-and-webmaster-tools&#34;&gt;Google Analytics and Webmaster Tools&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add Google Analytics, you may add your tracking id to &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;googleAnalytics = &amp;quot;UA-123-45&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;navigation-links&#34;&gt;Navigation Links&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add additional links in the drop down menu edit &lt;code&gt;data/navigation.toml&lt;/code&gt;. Use the following format to set the URL and title for as many links as you&amp;rsquo;d like. &lt;em&gt;External links will open in a new window.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[[links]]
title = &amp;quot;Theme Setup&amp;quot;
url = &amp;quot;/theme-setup/&amp;quot;

[[links]]
title = &amp;quot;External Link&amp;quot;
url = &amp;quot;http://mademistakes.com&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;adding-new-content&#34;&gt;Adding New Content&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Posts are stored in the &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; directory. By default, only content in the &lt;code&gt;content/posts&lt;/code&gt; will show up in the &lt;code&gt;All Posts&lt;/code&gt; section, however, you can link to other sections manually. For example, if you create a post at &lt;code&gt;gallery/photo1.md&lt;/code&gt;, your post will appear both under the home page and under &lt;code&gt;/gallery&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, Hugo has a shortcut for creating new posts: &lt;code&gt;hugo new gallery/photo1.md&lt;/code&gt;. See &lt;code&gt;hugo new --help&lt;/code&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;feature-images&#34;&gt;Feature Images&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good rule of thumb is to keep feature images nice and wide so you don&amp;rsquo;t push the body text too far down. An image cropped around around 1024 x 256 pixels will keep file size down with an acceptable resolution for most devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add a feature image to a post or page just include the filename in the front matter like so.&lt;/p&gt;
image:
  feature: /images/feature-image-filename.jpg
  thumb: thumbnail-image.jpg #keep it square 200x200 px is good

&lt;p&gt;If you want to apply attribution to a feature image use the following YAML front matter on posts or pages. Image credits appear directly below the feature image with a link back to the original source.&lt;/p&gt;
image:
  feature: feature-image-filename.jpg
  credit: Michael Rose #name of the person or site you want to credit
  creditlink: http://mademistakes.com #url to their site or licensing

&lt;p&gt;By default the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; containing feature images is set to have a minimum height of 400px with CSS. Anything taller is hidden with an &lt;code&gt;overflow: hidden&lt;/code&gt; declaration. You can customize the height of the homepage feature image and those appearing on posts/pages by modifying the following variables in &lt;code&gt;/static/css/_sass/_variables.scss&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
$feature-image-height: 400px; // min 150px recommended
$front-page-feature-image-height: 400px; // min 150px recommended

&lt;h4 id=&#34;post-page-thumbnails-for-og-and-twitter-cards&#34;&gt;Post/Page Thumbnails for OG and Twitter Cards&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post and page thumbnails work the same way. These are used by &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/&#34;&gt;Open Graph&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards&#34;&gt;Twitter Cards&lt;/a&gt; meta tags found in &lt;code&gt;partials/twitter-og-cards.html&lt;/code&gt;. If you don&amp;rsquo;t assign a thumbnail the image you assigned to &lt;code&gt;params.author.avatar&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; will be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of what a tweet to your site could look like if you activate Twitter Cards and include all the metas in your post&amp;rsquo;s YAML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://stevehemingway.github.io/images/twitter-card-summary-large-image.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Twitter Card summary large image screenshot&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter cards make it possible to attach images and post summaries to Tweets that link to your content. Summary Card meta tags have been added to &lt;code&gt;head.html&lt;/code&gt; to support this, you just need to &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards&#34;&gt;validate and apply your domain&lt;/a&gt; to turn it on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;videos&#34;&gt;Videos&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video embeds are responsive and scale with the width of the main content block with the help of &lt;a href=&#34;http://fitvidsjs.com/&#34;&gt;FitVids&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;further-customization&#34;&gt;Further Customization&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By editing values found in &lt;code&gt;static/css/_sass/variables.scss&lt;/code&gt; you can fine tune the site&amp;rsquo;s colors and typography. You will need a &lt;a href=&#34;http://sass-lang.com&#34;&gt;sass processor&lt;/a&gt; to render the files to css.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example if you wanted a red background instead of white you&amp;rsquo;d change &lt;code&gt;$bodycolor: #fff;&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;$bodycolor: $cc0033;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note from dldx: I haven&amp;rsquo;t changed the Gruntfile to work for hugo yet. If anyone would like to submit a PR, feel free! :) The following is just the original documentation for this theme&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To modify the site&amp;rsquo;s JavaScript files I setup a Grunt build script to lint/concatenate/minify all scripts into &lt;code&gt;scripts.min.js&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;http://nodejs.org/&#34;&gt;Install Node.js&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href=&#34;http://gruntjs.com/getting-started&#34;&gt;install Grunt&lt;/a&gt;, and then finally install the dependencies for the theme contained in &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
npm install

&lt;p&gt;From the theme&amp;rsquo;s root, use &lt;code&gt;grunt&lt;/code&gt; to concatenate JavaScript files and optimize &lt;code&gt;.jpg&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.png&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.svg&lt;/code&gt; files in the &lt;code&gt;images/&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use &lt;code&gt;grunt dev&lt;/code&gt; in combination with &lt;code&gt;bundle exec jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt; to watch for updates in JS files that Grunt will then automatically re-build as you write your code, which will in turn auto-generate your Jekyll site when developing locally.&lt;/p&gt;
