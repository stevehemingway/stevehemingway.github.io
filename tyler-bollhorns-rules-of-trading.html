<p>Tyler Bollhorn&#8217;s rules. He runs <a href="https://www.stockscores.com">www.stockscores.com</a>.
Lifted from <a href="http://www.tischendorf.com/2009/09/19/30-trading-rules-from-tyler-bollhorn-of-stockscores/">Tishendorf again</a>.</p>
<p>These have a lot of overlap with Gartman&#8217;s. 
The one that is a bit different, is number 26: that the pressure to mean-revert grows as a price moves further from its trend&nbsp;price.</p>
<ol>
<li>Buying a weak stock is like betting on a slow horse. It is&nbsp;retarded.</li>
<li>Stocks are only cheap if they are going higher after you buy&nbsp;them.</li>
<li>Never trust a person more than the market. People lie, the market does&nbsp;not.</li>
<li>Controlling losers is a must; let your winners run out of&nbsp;control.</li>
<li>Simplicity in trading demonstrates wisdom. Complexity is the sign of&nbsp;inexperience.</li>
<li>Have loyalty to your family, your dog, your team. Have no loyalty to your&nbsp;stocks.</li>
<li>Emotional traders want to give the disciplined their&nbsp;money.</li>
<li>Trends have counter trends to shake the weak hands out of the&nbsp;market.</li>
<li>The market is usually efficient and can not be beat. Exploit&nbsp;inefficiencies.</li>
<li>To beat the market, you must have an&nbsp;edge.</li>
<li>Being wrong is a necessary part of trading profitably. Admit when you are&nbsp;wrong.</li>
<li>If you do what everyone is doing you will be average, so goes the&nbsp;definition.</li>
<li>Information is only valuable if no one knows about&nbsp;it.</li>
<li>Lower your risk till you sleep like a&nbsp;baby.</li>
<li>There is always a reason why stocks go up or down, we usually only learn the reason when it is too&nbsp;late.</li>
<li>Trades that make a lot of intellectual sense are likely to be&nbsp;losers.</li>
<li>You do not have to be right more than you are wrong to make money in the&nbsp;market.</li>
<li>Don’t worry about the trades that you miss, there will always be&nbsp;another.</li>
<li>Fear is more powerful than greed and so down trends are sharper than up&nbsp;trends.</li>
<li>Analyze the people, not the&nbsp;stock.</li>
<li>Trading is a dictators game; you can not trade by&nbsp;committee.</li>
<li>The best traders are the ones who do not care about the&nbsp;money.</li>
<li>Do not think you are smarter than the market, you are&nbsp;not.</li>
<li>For most traders, profits are short term loans from the&nbsp;market.</li>
<li>The stock market can not be predicted, we can only play the&nbsp;probabilities.</li>
<li>The farther price is from a linear trend, the more likely it is to&nbsp;correct.</li>
<li>Learn from your losses, you paid for&nbsp;them.</li>
<li>The market is cruel, it gives the test first and the lesson&nbsp;afterward.</li>
<li>Trading is simple but it is not&nbsp;easy.</li>
<li>The easiest time to make money is when there is a&nbsp;trend.</li>
