<p>Gold, silver, copper all flat.
Lumber futures (<span class="caps">LB</span>) are having a terrific run up. I think this is definitely an inflation signal.
Faint stirrings of a yield curve steepening in Treasuries (I live in hope!).
The downtrend in China equities looking increasingly established. 
I&#8217;ve been bearish about the Hang Seng for a considerable time, but it&#8217;s been very strong this year, 
for reasons beyond me (endless pumping of new hope for &#8220;Phase 1&#8221; trade deal?).
<span class="caps">US</span> equities insanely resilient. Two consecutive down days for the Nasdaq was remarkable enough to produce a headline the other day. What other index has ever been like it?
Some negativity about <span class="caps">EU</span> banks in the <span class="caps">FT</span>, although it&#8217;s hard to see any banks doing well in this situation.
Dollar is fairly flat, but gently declining against currencies of countries which have a chance of maintaining a balance of payments surplus. I fancy Canadian dollars, personally, but the Aussie dollar is doing fairly well. 
I prefer Canada because I don&#8217;t like the China exposure implicit in Australian&nbsp;assets.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5cfb2253-40ec-4ef3-9c1a-94b8a7bf2307">This article</a> says that 57% of &#8220;slum dwellers&#8221; in Mumbai have antibodies to Covid-19. It seems hard to believe that in the long run the whole global population will not end up having been exposed. The article has a fairly negative tone, but to me it&#8217;s encouraging. 
There are reasons to fear the &#8220;fat tail&#8221; risk in pandemics, and it is conceivable that a disease emerges which is slow acting, very lethal, and fantastically infections (a sort of combination of <span class="caps">HIV</span> before anti-retrovirals and measles). The steps required to stop such a pathogen will be unimaginably damaging to the economy. I still suspect that we might decide not to do much about it collectively, but that is a political decision&nbsp;(unfortunately).</p>
<h2>Lumber</h2>
<p>This is a long-term chart of lumber prices. It&#8217;s very volatile. It might be easier to interpret if it were deflated by <span class="caps">CPI</span>. I can see why the expectation is that it will come down, but maybe not until it&#8217;s gone a lot higher.
What is clear is that recessions make lumber cheaper: hardly a blinding revelation. 
I assume that a forest owner who foresees a steep increase in the price of lumber in the future just leaves his trees in the ground. If they all do this, the price will react, à la rational expectations theory, and the price will spike today. We will&nbsp;see.</p>

<h2>Coal</h2>
<p>When I was a kid, we had an open fire, the fuel for which was offcuts of wood, and coal: this is not an experience shared by many children in the west these days.
<a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/28/why-theres-no-hope-for-coal-consumption-plunged-to-multi-decade-lows/">Coal is becoming increasingly irrelevant as a fuel</a>.
An exception might be metallurgical coal, which is specifically for blast furnaces and may have had its price depressed &#8216;unfairly.&#8217; $<span class="caps">HCC</span> has a lot of the stuff, but given that operating blast furnaces will increasingly be found only in China, it looks a risky thing to bet on. It&#8217;s a pity, because $<span class="caps">HCC</span> has &#8216;deep&nbsp;value&#8217;.</p>
<h2>Afternoon&nbsp;wrap</h2>
<p>The day is mildly risk on still.
<span class="caps">DX</span> is down, about 0.3%,
$ES_F is up about 0.8%,
<span class="caps">VIX</span> is down a bit,
there is a faint trace of yield curve steeping.
Gold and silver are becalmed, miners down.
Tankers are up a bit, without much movement in crude ($<span class="caps">CL</span> futures up 0.4%).
Nat. gas (future) is up over 3%. 
Euro area banks are down 1%.
The worst is yet to come, probably when all the head traders are on vacation in the&nbsp;Hamptons.</p>
