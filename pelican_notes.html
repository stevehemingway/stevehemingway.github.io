</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>This is a note for me, to remember how to create a new&nbsp;entry.</p>
<p>I had to fiddle a bit with Pelican to make it work <span class="caps">OK</span> on Windows and
to allow me to use a custom domain on github. 
You can see the full gory details at&nbsp;https://github.com/stevehemingway/stevehemingway.github.io.</p>
<p>The things that kept tripping me up were as&nbsp;follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>@echo in a makefile in Windows fails. Everything else is fine, but echo fails, 
because it&#8217;s not a proper command. This is all explained <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20712307/echo-fails-in-make-on-windows">here</a>.
The solution, as suggested, is to stick a &#8216;;&#8217; at the end of each echo line,
forcing it to be treated like a command. 
I actually use Pelican both on Windows and Linux systems, so I didn&#8217;t want
to break portability (although I would gladly have done so if there wasn&#8217;t an easy&nbsp;workaround).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&#8217;s not sufficient to tell github, via the settings, that you want to use a custom domain.
You have to have a file called <span class="caps">CNAME</span> in the root of the project with the custom domain name.
You can read about this <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-a-subdomain">here</a>.
The key sentence is &#8216;If you use a static site generator to build your site locally and push the generated files to GitHub, pull the commit that added the <span class="caps">CNAME</span> file to your local repository. For more information, see &#8220;Troubleshooting custom domains and GitHub Pages.&#8221;&#8217; 
The problem is that Pelican just trashes all the files and removes the <span class="caps">CNAME</span> file every time the site is generated. It took me a painfully long time to work out what was going wrong. The fix was to insert an extra line into the makefile:&nbsp;publish:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="err">$(PELICAN) $(INPUTDIR) -o $(OUTPUTDIR) -s $(PUBLISHCONF) $(PELICANOPTS)</span>
<span class="err">echo $(CUSTOM_DOMAIN_NAME) &gt; $(OUTPUTDIR)/CNAME</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Using github involves working on two branches, <em>master</em>, which is the hard-coded branch name that github pages will always serve the site from, and another one, which I have called <em>content</em> (but is configurable in <em>pythonconf.py</em>) which has the actual 
&#8216;source&#8217; for the website. The generated stuff in master still clutters the root directory, and you can&#8217;t get rid of it because git won&#8217;t let you push until you&#8217;ve pulled (fnarr&nbsp;fnarr). </p>
<p>That&#8217;s quite enough tech stuff for&nbsp;today!</p>
