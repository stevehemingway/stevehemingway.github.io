<p>Down 1.3% at the open, despite having taken a bracing position. Didn&#8217;t want to go completely market neutral as I believe that this market has further to&nbsp;fall.</p>
<p>As of&nbsp;09:15:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bought 1 <span class="caps">DX</span> by accident. Was trying put on a stop, but didn&#8217;t change it from the default order type of limit, so it executed immediately. At least at market price. Worried that the <span class="caps">USD</span> will be &#8216;unexpectedly&#8217; resilient because the Fed still keeps monetary policy too tight, relative to <span class="caps">ECB</span>,</li>
<li><span class="caps">BTP</span> bought, stop&nbsp;triggered</li>
<li><span class="caps">SPI</span> sold, price action, China&nbsp;exposure</li>
<li><span class="caps">SX7P</span>, extended position. Thesis is that as <span class="caps">US</span> rates go down, <span class="caps">ECB</span> be forced to go more negative, which has bad impact on <span class="caps">EU</span> banks, which are already pretty&nbsp;weak,</li>
<li><span class="caps">UB</span> fut. sold. <span class="caps">UB</span> spiked really, really high yesterday (&gt;240!) so this is a punt on the Fed triggering proper inflation. Don&#8217;t know what this price is as a yield, but has to be way less than&nbsp;2%!</li>
<li><span class="caps">DAX</span> sold, stop&nbsp;triggered</li>
<li><span class="caps">DX</span> stopped out&nbsp;(earlier)</li>
<li><span class="caps">GE</span> future (Eurodollar, not equity)) bought. Price is scarily high, but this is a direct bet on <span class="caps">US</span> rates going to&nbsp;zero.</li>
<li>10:21: (I wrote and installed a python macro to insert a timestamp in Notepad++.&nbsp;Yay!)</li>
<li>10:22: losses shrink to 0.3% so I&#8217;m leaving off any trades for&nbsp;now</li>
<li>10:29: P&amp;L goes green. You sell another <span class="caps">UB</span> and R future. Market is expecting stimulus. You are now using $30K of margin on your <span class="caps">UB</span>&nbsp;position.</li>
<li>11:00: decided to sell <span class="caps">BTP</span>. It has jumped a lot. Italy is still a mess. I am now up&nbsp;1%.</li>
<li>17:31: wild ride in afternoon. Initially showed losses of $91K: about 10%. This went right down to $20K. It then shot up again. Stocks bounced a long way back from their lows yesterday. Probably I should have closed all positions, but I am sure we have not finished with the drop. Anyhow, nothing much I can do now apart from hold on until tomorrow. I am still up a lot over 2 days but it shows how much really violent moves can bounce the next&nbsp;day.</li>
