</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h2>The markets&nbsp;today</h2>
<p>The general tone seems to be risk on: steeping yield curve, miners down, gold flat, equities up. No very dramatic moves, although <span class="caps">SPX</span> is very close to breaching its high for the year, which was (surely) its all time high.
Even European bank stocks are rallying, in spite of a 12% decline in European <span class="caps">GDP</span>. Is a failing economy good news for banks who have lent to businesses out&nbsp;there?</p>
<p>A story caught my eye: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gm-evgo/gm-partners-with-evgo-to-add-2700-new-fast-chargers-in-u-s-idUSKCN24W2JQ"><span class="caps">GM</span> plans to roll out a charging network of its own</a>. With a 2022 forecast P/E of 4.4x, I think <span class="caps">GM</span> looks better value than <span class="caps">TSLA</span> from my point of view. 
<span class="caps">GM</span> owns <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_%28autonomous_vehicle%29">Cruise</a> which is a serious player in the autonomous driving space.
If markets can&#8217;t stay down (because &#8230; Fed), it seems logical to go long promising&nbsp;companies.</p>
<p>Chinese equities are down a bit, because of the fuss over TikTok. It&#8217;s about to be bought by Microsoft, because it&#8217;s currently Chinese owned. The ban is a piece of signalling in my view.
$<span class="caps">BABA</span> (Alibaba) is up, though. I guess <span class="caps">US</span> investors are relaxed about being long a stock that has the Chinese politburo standing behind it.&nbsp;Still.</p>
<h2>From Wolf&nbsp;Richer</h2>
<p><a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/03/rents-swoon-in-san-francisco-other-expensive-cities-and-tx-ok-oil-patch-y-y-but-23-cities-with-red-hot-double-digit-rent-increases/">Severe stress in <span class="caps">US</span> rental market</a>.
<a href="https://www.idiosyncraticwhisk.com/2020/07/a-miracle-homeownership-boom.html">There is something very odd going on in the <span class="caps">US</span> real estate market</a> according to Kevin Erdmann. 
Home ownership, as a proportion of all properties, has shot up 2.6%. Something is very fishy: Erdmann doesn&#8217;t seem to be able to explain this, which means that I don&#8217;t have a hope. Somehow, I feel that it would have more to do with rental properties disappearing, or being put up for sale for owner occupation, than to do with buyers suddenly having lots of money to move out of rental&nbsp;accommodation. </p>
<p><a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/07/31/average-age-of-cars-trucks-on-the-road-sets-record-will-jump-during-pandemic-as-new-vehicle-sales-plunge-to-1970s-level/">Cars are lasting longer</a>. I&#8217;ve suspected this for a while, just through casual observation of what&#8217;s around me as I travel around. The article is about the <span class="caps">US</span>, but the same effect must be playing out here.
And people are driving less. This has to be good for drivers and for everyone else. 
The terrible planning system we have in the <span class="caps">UK</span> might just be saved by workers not needing to be in the centre of London, whose world-beating productivity was probably never about it&#8217;s location but more about the fact that most of the best graduates end up working for firms based there after&nbsp;university.</p>
<h2>Close of&nbsp;play</h2>
<p>I haven&#8217;t bothered to check, but from Twitter I gather that the <span class="caps">NDX</span> has powered ahead yet again.
The Fed balance sheet grew more than expected, which might not be unrelated.
Mondays always seem to be risk on, but generally risk appetite deflates through the rest of the week.
We shall see if this week is any&nbsp;different.</p>
