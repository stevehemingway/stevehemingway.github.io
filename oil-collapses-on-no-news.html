<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>Today was an explosively risk-on day.
A few things happened: <span class="caps">UAE</span> suggested that <span class="caps">OPEC</span> would sell more oil, Zelenskyy said he&#8217;d talk to the Russians,
people seem to have decided that the Fed and the <span class="caps">ECB</span> will hike less, or later than they were thinking earlier, and Sweden said that it would definitely not apply to join <span class="caps">NATO</span>. These did not seem like game changers, even in aggregate. 
But oil fell $15 a barrel! Oil dragged virtually every other commodity down with it (e.g. heating oil fell 22%).
Stocks exploded. <span class="caps">OK</span>, 20% for Moscow wasn&#8217;t that much, in the context of recent falls. But nearly 8% for the <span class="caps">DAX</span> seems&nbsp;excessive.</p>
<p>My guess is that the most probable move tomorrow will reverse all this, but with a nearly equal probability of the move continuing. Volatility is so high nothing would surprise me, including everything remaining totally&nbsp;unchanged.</p>
<p>Because the markets were risk on, the dollar ($<span class="caps">DX</span>) dropped back, to under 98, and the <span class="caps">EUR</span> shot up,&nbsp;$1.1.</p>
<p>In Ukraine itself, people continue to die, but it seems as though the world has moved on, has assumed that Russia will win, and Ukraine will become like Crimea before it: a Russian client&nbsp;oblast.</p>
<p>On a longer view, I suspect that fears of inflation are overdone.
The <span class="caps">US</span> Treasury ten-year yield is still below 2%, which represents a huge numbers of portfolio managers betting with their bonuses that inflation is not going to get out of hand.
A week&#8217;s spike in some commodities that are traded with huge leverage is not a sustained bull market.
However, with headline prints heading for 9 or 10%, central banks could still screw things up and throw us into a recession. 
That will definitely cut inflation off at the&nbsp;knees.</p>
