<p>Everything quiet as the grave.
The <span class="caps">SPX</span> breaking through its <span class="caps">ATH</span> yesterday was met with a shrug, with everything slightly down,
except the <span class="caps">FTSE</span>, which was down 1%.
That is except Borsa Istanbul, which was up 0.6%, in <span class="caps">TRY</span> terms.
In <span class="caps">EUR</span> terms, not so much, which also goes for the <span class="caps">SPX</span>.
The Euro is up a lot against the dollar this year. 
Robin Brooks was quoted in the <span class="caps">FT</span> as saying that it&#8217;s unsustainable,
which I guess is another way of saying that the <span class="caps">ECB</span> is going to lose the race to devalue its currency to the Fed.
Clearly, the Fed has a lot going for it, not least over a hundred years of doing its own thing. 
However, the dollar has a lot going for it too, not least the <span class="caps">US</span> military, 
which means a lot, I think, even in today&#8217;s&nbsp;world.</p>
<h2>Afternoon&nbsp;thoughts</h2>
<p>$<span class="caps">TSLA</span> is <em>sui generis.</em> 
Although there are many companies that make battery electric vehicles, there are none quite as extraordinary as $<span class="caps">TSLA</span>. 
Maybe Musk is a genius, maybe he&#8217;s a charlatan. 
Edison was a bit of both.
The story of the company is going to make a blockbuster film, one day, but for the moment you have to be satisfied with less visual sources. 
I would recommend <a href="https://quoththeraven.podbean.com/e/quoth-the-raven-216-montana-skeptic/">this podcast</a> for one side of the argument, but put by a measured sane individual (the Skeptic), being interviewed by a rather more excitable individual (Chris Irons). 
The <span class="caps">QTR</span> podcast series is rather uneven in quality, providing a platform for some out and out conspiracy theorists that the mainstream media would not touch with a bargepole. 
My view is that we should be grown up enough to make up our own minds.
Please do so for the episode&nbsp;above.</p>
<p><a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/08/19/the-fed-made-sure-the-rich-got-richer-during-the-pandemic-why-thats-bad-for-the-economy/">Wolf Richer</a> says that most of us didn&#8217;t actually get richer, from the Fed&#8217;s actions. 
The divergence is not so extreme in Europe, but I can&#8217;t believe that the BoE really reduced inequality by its actions.
<a href="https://alkhaleejtoday.co/business/5033088/The-road-to-inflation-in-post-COVID-times.html">There is generational inequality too, for sure</a>.</p>
<h2>Close</h2>
<p>Everything went into reverse today. 
Turkish Lira rallied, against the odds,
commodities rallies, apart from precious metals,
the dollar index went up by 0.5%.
Equities were generally up, with the exception of China and China-related (e.g. <span class="caps">HK</span> <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Singapore).
Volumes probably thin, but I didn&#8217;t bother to check. 
A time when market manipulators can have a big&nbsp;impact.</p>
<p><span class="caps">FOMC</span> minutes released today. Chatter about yield curve control, somehow supposed to explain drop in precious metals. I will read the <span class="caps">FT</span> tomorrow to try to understand the&nbsp;logic.</p>
