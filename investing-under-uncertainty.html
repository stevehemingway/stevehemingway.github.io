</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h1>Another day, another vaccine&nbsp;candidate</h1>
<p>Astra-Zeneca announced today that it too had a very effective vaccine against <span class="caps">SARS</span>-Cov2. 
Who knew that it&#8217;d be so easy?
The market didn&#8217;t react much, and just ground higher.
Maybe it would have been five percent lower if the announcement had not been made.
Who can&nbsp;tell?</p>
<h1>Traditional valuation metrics considered&nbsp;outdated</h1>
<p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4390483-hayden-capital-quarterly-letter-q3-2020">Hayden capital have written a note saying that <span class="caps">DCF</span> approaches to value are wrongheaded</a>.
Well, that&#8217;s sort of true, in the short run. 
It&#8217;s true that the radical uncertainty of the real world makes valuing something by mechanically discounting cash flows according to a zero coupon curve is flawed. Using a higher rate as a way of allowing for uncertainty about the future cash flows is even more flawed. 
However, I somehow feel that sacrificing consumption today does require some sort of mechanism to compare the sacrifice against the consumption in the future in a comparable, risk-adjusted,&nbsp;basis. </p>
<h1>Student housing <span class="caps">CMBS</span>&#8217;s looking&nbsp;sick</h1>
<p><a href="https://wolfstreet.com/2020/11/22/taxpayers-face-435-billion-in-student-loan-losses-already-baked-in-department-of-education-study/">This article</a> argues that student housing mortgage backed securities are not a good place to be. 
The whole situation of <span class="caps">US</span> (and <span class="caps">UK</span>) student loans seems pretty terrible. 
The problem is that the Fed may be able to inflate the problem away, so it&#8217;s hard to know how to take advantage of the&nbsp;situation.</p>
<h1>Wrap</h1>
<p>Another vaccine and risk on knows no bounds.
Unloved sectors like airlines, energy and value all catch a bid.
Precious metals forget all about looming inflation as money flows into income-generating assets.
Agricultural commodities benefit modestly ($<span class="caps">DBA</span> up 0.78%).
Miners are crushed.
Bitcoin retraces a bit.
The Turkish Lira suddenly reverses as investors wonder whether 15% interest rates are politically sustainable.
Brazilian Real dropped 0.9% against the dollar today. Brazil had excessively high interest rates, so it was coming.
The <span class="caps">JPY</span> dropped 0.71%. This alone confirms the risk-offness of&nbsp;today.</p>
<h1>Inequality</h1>
<p>I haven&#8217;t embedded from this source before. Hope it works. 
The point is that the late 70&#8217;s were the trough of inequality in the <span class="caps">UK</span>. 
After a long downward trend, once I became an adult, inequality started to increase and shows no sign of reversing.
This eventually will have political consequences, I&nbsp;feel.</p>
