<p>I&#8217;m lethargic. My office is at 29C and humid. The markets are lethargic. 
At some point new homes in the <span class="caps">UK</span> will be fitted with A/C.
Liquidity is terrible, even for $ES_F, the <span class="caps">SP</span> 500 mini future, which should be the most liquid equity instrument on the planet.
The 10 year Treasury future ($<span class="caps">ZN</span>) is spookily flat. 
It looks like the <span class="caps">JGB</span> future, that barely trades, because the BoJ has bought up all the bonds.
Nothing looks promising. The opposing forces of massive monetary stimulus and massive virus-created economic damage seem perfectly in balance, eliminating opportunities for&nbsp;profit.</p>
<h2>Tidying</h2>
<p>The contango trade, championed by Kuppy, has not aged well.
In situations like this, it is very hard to know what to do.
The simplest thing is to cut one&#8217;s losses, which is what I&#8217;d normally do, 
especially as it has never really made any money.
The alternative, though is to write some short-dated calls, to alleviate the short term pain, 
get some income, and keep the trade idea alive.
I 
A some wag has pointed out, a long-term holding is a short-term idea that went horribly wrong.
You can read about Kuppy&#8217;s thesis <a href="https://adventuresincapitalism.com/2020/03/19/crude-contango/">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Trading&nbsp;ideas</h2>
<p><span class="caps">US</span> retail REITs surely have further to fall. Relative to <span class="caps">UK</span> retail space, the <span class="caps">US</span> has a giant amount.
It&#8217;s really expensive to short REITs because of the huge yield they have. 
The Simon Property Group was recently trading at a 15% yield. 
That&#8217;s an awful lot of carry.
Not sure what high-yielding stock could be used in a pair trade to offset this&nbsp;effect.</p>
<p>European Banks are in a terrible state (because Euro long-term rates have been repressed forever, so there is no money any longer in maturity transformation: the main value traditionally added by banks). 
The problem is that if you try to take advantage of this, you&#8217;re up against someone with a very big budget indeed:
the <span class="caps">ECB</span>, with Madam Lagarde determined that banks won&#8217;t fail on her watch. 
I plan to listen to <a href="https://quoththeraven.podbean.com/e/quoth-the-raven-203-danielle-dimartino-booth/">this podcast</a>. I started listening, and I heard <span class="caps">DD</span>-B explain that J Powell wanted to do the right thing when he arrive, but that the system is simply too big for him to fight. Chris Irons is a loose cannon, but occasionally his interviews are worth listening to, <span class="caps">IMHO</span>.</p>
<h2>Wrap</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s the end of the week. 
Equities seem to sag towards the close.
This is fairly common: longs taking profits?
Gold up a bit.
Kudlow on <span class="caps">TV</span> claiming that all statistics point to a V-shaped recovery.
The <span class="caps">EU</span> seems to be talking about requiring visitors from the <span class="caps">US</span> to be quarantined, in contrast to most other visitors.
Trump behaving oddly: staying in Washington, not appearing at a news conference: Twitter is full of conspiracy theories, but in all probability he just can&#8217;t be bothered to shlep over to <span class="caps">NY</span> or Florida, given the heat and the&nbsp;virus.</p>
<p>Otherwise:&nbsp;nada!</p>
