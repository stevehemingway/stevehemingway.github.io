This is a pelican blog. Checkout the actual github pages website for more info. 


You can see the output at https://www.stevehemingway.com. 

The source code is under the directory content/. 
I use a static website generator called Pelican to generated HTML pages which are then hosted directly on github, using the githubpages  (https://pages.github.com) feature that github makes available.
I have written some posts about how this all works, but if you google the keywords you should get what you need.
Note that I do not use the Jekyll generator, even though it does a similar job to Pelican,
because the latter is written in Python and I have a somewhat better chance of fixing it if it doesn't do what I need.
