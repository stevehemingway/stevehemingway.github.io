<h2><span class="caps">CPI</span>&nbsp;read</h2>
<p><span class="caps">US</span> inflation (<span class="caps">CPI</span> measure) was 5.4% annualized in July, a rate unchanged from the previous month and fractionally above&nbsp;expectations.</p>
<p>Crude stocks were marginally less down than&nbsp;expected.</p>
<p>The Senate passed a $1T (i.e. $<span class="caps">1MMM</span>) infrastructure bill, with cross party support. 
A federal budget framework of $3.5T was also agreed by the Senate (very narrowly,&nbsp;50-49).</p>
<p>A deficit of $<span class="caps">302MMM</span> was notched up in July. At that rate, that&#8217;s a deficit of $3.6T: a lot of money.
A trillion here, a trillion there, and pretty soon we&#8217;re talking real money.
Stocks went up, more all time highs.
The dollar dropped to 93 (<span class="caps">DXY</span>), but it&#8217;s still very high.
Treasuries were unbothered.
Nothing matters, until everything matters. 
The sentiment of the market is that everything will turn out <span class="caps">OK</span>.
Maybe that&#8217;s correct.
The market is probably an unbiased&nbsp;indicator.</p>
<h2><span class="caps">UK</span> Housing&nbsp;market</h2>
<p>Banks are problematic institutions.
They transform illiquid risky assets into money, which is liquid and risk free.
But they can only do this by assigning all the risk to the government.
Ultimately, governments cannot afford, politically, to see bank deposits vaporized.
So all the incentives for bankers to balance risk and reward, at least as far as risk to depositors is concerned, is removed.
To compensate for this, banks are subject to mind-bogglingly complex regulation to prevent them taking too much risk.
The result of this is that banks compete with each other by being better at finding loopholes in the regulation.
Every so often there is a crash, taxpayers bail out the banks, and another set of loopholes is plugged, but only at the cost of making bank regulation even more complex and&nbsp;gameable. </p>
<p>Because housing and land constitutes by far the biggest asset on banks&#8217; balance sheets, the side effect of this policy is to make housing a one-way bet for investors, but an unaffordable luxury for those who want to actually consume housing&nbsp;services.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a mess. It&#8217;s becoming a consensus on the left that it&#8217;s a sort of conspiracy to enrich the rentier class. 
I don&#8217;t actually think this narrative is true. It&#8217;s more likely that some reasonable-sounding policies to improve the stability of the financial system had unforeseen consequences. 
But, whatever the origin of the problem, it has become a very serious one and has created a formidable intersection of interest groups which see radical reform as likely to do them serious economic&nbsp;harm.</p>
