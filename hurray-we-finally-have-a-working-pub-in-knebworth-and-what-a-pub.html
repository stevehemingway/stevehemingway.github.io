</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>We&#8217;ve had to wait a long time for <a href="http://www.thelyttonarms.co.uk/">The Lytton Arms</a> to re-open, but on Thursday the 17th May the day we&#8217;ve all been waiting for arrived. The Lytton Arms was once again open for&nbsp;business.</p>
<p>The pub has been upgraded in many ways, some visible, some less so:
- the kitchen has been totally refurbished and is now state of the art,
- the cellar has been re-fitted and can accommodate nine cask ales and a cask cider,
- the old conservatory with the fly-catching nets has gone, and in its place is a modern, warm replacement,
- the outside area (where the beer festival casks were set up) is now opened out right through to the boundary with the fields. This is a huge improvement on the old garden, and is perfect for this time of year,
- every square centimetre of paintwork has been renewed, and the colour scheme modernised,
- the roof and structural features of the building have all been&nbsp;fixed!</p>
<p>There are probably more improvements, but the main thing for me is that the pub now has plenty of beer, quick food service, a 50% discount on food until the end of the month (search for the code, but you&#8217;ll probably get it anyway if you ask), and a marvellous buzz of local residents enjoying a quiet drink in comfortable&nbsp;surroundings.</p>
<p>Jason has now taken over the running of the pub, with a very able team, which includes Stef, who will be familiar to all the regulars from the late James Price&#8217;s time running The Lytton. The pub is now part of <a href="http://www.acinns.co.uk/">Anglian Country Inns</a>, a highly professional operation run by Cliff Nye, brother of Steve Nye, former landlord at the&nbsp;pub.</p>
<p>Current beers include Fat Sprat by Adnams,  Koha by Mad Squirrel, Happy People by Shiny People, Nelson&#8217;s Revenge by Woodfords, Hawse Buckler by Oakham, Bring Me Sunshine by Tring, Lucky Lobster by Brancaster (part of <span class="caps">AC</span> Inns), Tiki Blonde by Mad Squirrel, Squid Ink by <span class="caps">XT</span>, Take 5 by Harpoon and Affligem by De Smelt as well as Rapple, a Raspberry cider by Apple Cottage. However, even as I type this some of these brews will have been replace. It&#8217;s very unlikely you&#8217;ll visit and not find anything interesting to&nbsp;drink.</p>
<p>The Lytton now has its own social media presence: on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/TheLyttonArms/">Instagram</a>, on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lyttonarms/">Facebook</a> and on <a href="https://twitter.com/TheLyttonArms">Twitter</a>.
