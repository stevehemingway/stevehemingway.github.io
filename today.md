## Norway, commodities

<<<<<<< HEAD
Generally, this was a risk-on day.
There are some rumours that Zelenskyy and Putin will sit down to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine.
In response to this:

- oil prices continue to sag, although at a slowing rate relative to the last few trading days,
- equity indexes, globally went up. High beta stocks (e.g. $TSLA) disproportionately,
- most commodities were dragged down with oil, lumber being an exception,
- most sovereign bond yields went up, in a more-or-less parallel shift across the curve,
- the dollar went down, by about 67bp. Most other currencies followed suit, except GBP, which sank alongside the dollar (GBP/USD = 1.31).

In other news, Russia's demands to be paid in RUB for its oil and gas was resisted by the EU.
In the US there was a proposal to tax billionaires on unrealized capital gains.

On practically all measures (5-30s, 3m-5y, OIS 30-10, etc.) yield curves are inverting with a widespread acceptance that this indicates that the short-term rate is above "r-star", the rate which can co-exist with full employment. In other words, we are heading for recession, but the stock market is only 3.5% off its ATM. Bears such as Sven Henrich and Stanphyl Capital are wailing. At some point they will be right. 

## Image of the day

=======
Norway supplies 7% of Europe's oil and 16% of it's gas.

It seems to me that NOK.SKR has to be a buy, but what do I know?
Brazil has to benefit from increasing commodity prices. 
I've been bullish about it for a long time, but political uncertainty is a drag.
For what it's worth, Brazilian stocks look good. 
This is something that Vincent Deluard has been saying for a couple of years.
The thesis is that in a time for soaring inflation, commodity producing countries will do well.

I think the possibility of a global recession/stock market crash is the the problem. EM has always struggled to have the same returns as developed economies (probably because of bad governance), and especially high beta relative to the SPX. 

Russia is well on the way to liquidating its holdings of US Treasuries. 
It's easy to see why.
The $64e12 question is what China will do.
China knows that if it steps out of line on Taiwan, the govt. and the kleptocrats in charge of it will be targetted.
It's easy to see that running down their holdings of US Treasuries is a no-brainer. 
Or it would seem that way to me, but ... China!

## Wrap

The energy complex was down.
Equities were up.
Bond yields are still going up: US 10Y now at 2.37%.
Stocks generally were up, although Chinese indexes were an exception.
The promises by the Chinese govt. to support stock prices only goes so far.
