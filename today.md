## Ukraine and fascism

I am not an expert on Ukraine, any more than I was on Covid or supply chains.
Twitter is a source which is not ideal, but it does have some good content.
I think it's worth reading this.
Certainly, it must be correct to say that Russia is already a fascist state, in the sense that it is controlled by a small group which controls the corporations in the country.
I am sure that the corporations are not models of governance themselves, but the congruence of the state and business interest is surely a key feature of the Russian state, which itself is a consequence of the disastrous "Washington Consensus" privatization of swathes of Russian nationalized industries was forced on Russia by the IMF, World Bank, WEF _et al._

I am not saying that the current kleptocratic state that is Russia today is entirely the fault of the USA, but one feels that if Russia had been treated like Europe after WWII by the USA, with a Marshall Plan equivalent and help to rebuild society, this would not have happened.
OK, I'm no historian, but it clearly was a disaster for the ordinary Russian peasant.

## Consumer credit

The pandemic saw a collapse in borrowing, because people could not go out and spend. The best they could do was order electronic devices from Amazon and takeaway meals from Uber Eats. Now things are very different.

They will look to strike or find a new, better-paying, job.
## Truth

There are good reasons to lie. Mankind cannot stand too much honesty. But there are also bad reasons to lie. Market commentary is frequently tainted with the bad reason. 
When some random substack newsletter author tells his subscribers that such and such a stock is a steal, he probably believes it.
He has also probably already purchased some (or done the equivalent, such as selling puts or buying calls). 
It's understandable: he's sharing the benefits of the research he did, in exchange for what will probably be a very modest uplift in the price of the stock.
Unless he's Jim Cramer or Elon Musk.

## UK average real earnings

It would be better to show median earnings, but this is interesting.

=======
People lie to kids. They tell them that anything is possible, that the American Dream is still alive and well. 
It's rational to tell kids that they world is their oyster, and that they should follow their passion. 
This is kind, but it can be cruel. Most kids will never make it to be an opera singer, or a pop star, or a premiership footballer.
Even the most talented kids will wilt in the heat of the sort of competition that exists at the top.

Very many kids go to university, study for masters and doctoral degrees. Orders of magnitude more young people obtain advanced degrees, but the idea
that they will all better off as a new cohort is simply wrong, unless jobs that will increase in productivity as a result. 
The reality is that professional job openings in accountancy and law will  decline because  artificial intelligence will eventually be more widely introduced. Speaking as someone who has endured more than his fair share of the paper-bound and glacial process of buying and selling houses, it's cle,It is taking longer than expected, but just imagine how many counter staff banks employed forty years ago, relative to now.
Universities do not, as far as I can tell, attempt to match what they teach to demand for jobs. They might argue that nobody knows what the pattern of demand might be in a generation's time, so they can't be expected to design courses with it in mind.
But in practice they teach vast numbers of students "Business studies", which is just about the opposite of a training someone to think and be analytical. 

The worst sort of lie, though, is the one that shirks our duty to give honest evaluation and feedback.
When we want to know, we want to know. 
To praise someone for average achievement is not a kindness. It is a dereliction of duty.

## Wrap for the week

Yields continue to rise, although erratically.
The dollar continues to be strong, $DXY now close to 100.
Commodities quite mixed. Oil down, gold up, but neither by much.
Stocks fairly level. Down on the week, but not by a lot.
