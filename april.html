<p>I attended a meeting on 11 March with representatives of <span class="caps">NHDC</span> and
Stevenage Borough Council about the transfer of ownership and management
of Norton Green Common to Knebworth Parish Council. The discussion was
very constructive, and all parties confirmed that they could envisage no
major obstacles to the transfers taking place. The legal process will
take some time, and the Parish Council have yet to ratify that they wish
to take on this expanded role, but I believe that this meeting was a
milestone towards the goal of improving the Common as an important piece
of amenity land within the Parish.
The Secretary of State for the Department for Communities and Local
Government has confirmed that an inquiry will be held under Section 77
of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 into the application for
planning permission for the Swangleys Lane Solar Farm. Datchworth Parish
Council plan to submit evidence and make a representation to the
inquiry. They are looking for financial support from other Parish
Councils and other interested parties. The inquiry will examine the
appropriateness of developing this installation on this site in the
Green Belt.
On a separate, but related matter, the planning application for the
solar generation facility at Three Houses Lane (ref. 14/02360/1) has
been amended and is being reviewed by <span class="caps">NHDC</span>. The scale of the
installation has been reduced, to <span class="caps">5MW</span>, but it remains in the Green Belt.
Nicholas Pellett is leading the objectors to this application. Knebworth
Parish Council are opposed to the application.
Steve Deakin Davies is looking for singers to appear in a video for the
Knebworth Festival, on 26 June. Lots of events and activities are
planned for the day, including a video featuring Knebworth singers, each
singing a line of &#8216;Perfect Day&#8217;, along the lines of the famous <span class="caps">BBC</span>
video. Contact Steve on 07508832581 for more&nbsp;information.</p>
