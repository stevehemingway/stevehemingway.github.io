</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h1>But within the constraints imposed by the democratic&nbsp;process</h1>
<p>The Copenhagen Consensus is what politicians would do if they carried out a clear-eyed evaluation of the costs and benefits of various policies. The problem is they don&#8217;t, because it would not be good politics. If we are looking at saving lives, and making saved lives better, we should divert resources to the poorest people on the planet. Unfortunately, those are the people who have no voice, because they live in countries ruled by psychopaths and&nbsp;kleptocrats.</p>
<p>Maybe we should get rid of the kleptocrats. There are two problems with&nbsp;this:</p>
<ul>
<li>kleptocrats are much more biddable, and can be bought for modest sums, especially when we turn a blind eye to &#8216;commissions&#8217; paid to cronies when the West sells defence systems to these&nbsp;people,</li>
<li>there are probably no known examples of a foreign power successfully causing a country to transition from a dictatorship to a democracy. Just ask the Iraquis, or Libyans, or&nbsp;Afghanistanis. </li>
</ul>
<p>The other approach would be to just say to people in very poor countries: &#8216;come to our country: we need immigrants because our young people have to support and endlessly growing mass of old, unproductive ones.&#8217; Well, we all know what happens to politicians who want to go down this&nbsp;route.</p>
<p>For the planet, we need to stop handing out subsidies, and tax polluting businesses. But, how can we piss off those businesses, which employ so many workers, and pay so much to politicians in&nbsp;&#8216;donations?&#8217;</p>
<p>To boost the economy of the planet, we need to break down trade barriers, and support farmers in Africa, and educate the uneducated. Well, the ways that policies that would achieve these would cause problems for western politicians is left as an exercise for the&nbsp;reader.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, here are the&nbsp;recommendations:</p>
<h2>People</h2>
<ul>
<li>Lower chronic child malnutrition by&nbsp;40%</li>
<li>Halve malaria&nbsp;infection</li>
<li>Reduce tuberculosis deaths by&nbsp;90%</li>
<li>Avoid 1.1 million <span class="caps">HIV</span> infections through&nbsp;circumcision</li>
<li>Cut early death from chronic diseases by&nbsp;1/3</li>
<li>Reduce newborn mortality by&nbsp;70%</li>
<li>Increase immunization to reduce child deaths by&nbsp;25%</li>
<li>Make family planning available to&nbsp;everyone</li>
<li>Eliminate violence against women and&nbsp;girls</li>
</ul>
<h2>Planet</h2>
<ul>
<li>Phase out fossil fuel&nbsp;subsidies</li>
<li>Halve coral reef&nbsp;loss</li>
<li>Tax pollution damage from&nbsp;energy</li>
<li>Cut indoor air pollution by&nbsp;20%</li>
</ul>
<h2>Prosperity</h2>
<ul>
<li>Reduce trade restrictions (full Doha): tariffs impoverish&nbsp;everyone</li>
<li>Improve gender equality in ownership, business, and&nbsp;politics</li>
<li>Boost agricultural yield increase by 40% (grain yields in Africa are still typically below what they could achieve in Italy at the time of the Roman&nbsp;Empire!),</li>
<li>Increase girls’ education by 2&nbsp;years</li>
<li>Achieve universal primary education in sub-Saharan&nbsp;Africa</li>
<li>Triple preschool in sub-Saharan&nbsp;Africa</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/post-2015-consensus/nobel-laureates-guide-smarter-global-targets-2030">Prioritizing 19 targets instead of the <span class="caps">UN</span>’s 169 targets is equivalent to doubling or quadrupling foreign&nbsp;aid</a></p>
<h1>Twenty Eight Trillion&nbsp;Dollars</h1>
<p>That sounds like a&nbsp;lot!</p>
